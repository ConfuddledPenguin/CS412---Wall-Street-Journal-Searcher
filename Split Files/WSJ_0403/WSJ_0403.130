   Sweden's Forsakringsbolaget SPP, Omsesidigt (SPP) said it
bought an additional 37.4 million ordinary shares in London &amp;
Edinburgh Trust PLC (LET), boosting its control of the
British property group to 50.02% of ordinary shares.
   SPP said its purchase of a further 20.1% of LET shares was
made both at the cash offer price of 220 pence ($3.62) a
share and the 223.5 pence a share its offer is worth
inclusive of a special 3.5 pence interim dividend. Before
launching its #500 million ($824 million) bid, SPP owned
about 1.2% of LET shares.

   Together with the 28.8% of LET already irrevocably pledged
to accepting the offer, SPP now has direct ownership or
irrevocable acceptances of 50.02% of the U.K. concern.
