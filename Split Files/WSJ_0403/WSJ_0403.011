   LONDON -- British manufacturers' order books fell to a
three-year low in March and expectations are for little if
any increase in industrial output over the next four months,
according to a survey by the Confederation of British
Industry.
   In its latest industrial trends report, the CBI said the
decline in order books, to the lowest level since October
1986, came despite a rise in export orders.

   On inflation, however, expectations of price rises were at
their lowest since 1986, with only 24% of companies
anticipating increases.
