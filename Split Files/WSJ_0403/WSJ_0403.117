   Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   The solitary buffalo crossed an open field near Rescue
Creek Trail. Enormous, old, he walked stiff-legged and
without hurry. His massive head with its thick, curling,
almost-black hair bobbed up and down, sniffing the earth,
delicately picking up bits of grass to eat. On his shoulders
and hump the curling hair had turned pale cinnamon, as it
often does in old bulls, while his slender back and hips were
the same deep brown they had always been. Noble ice-age
beast, he ambled through sagebrush, carrying in his ancient
heart all the centuries of his existence. He has been in
Yellowstone since the last glaciers left, 10,000 years ago.

   The Rescue Creek trailhead is not far from the park's
north entrance, at Gardiner, and the boundary between the
park and the state of Montana. Would the old bull cross to be
greeted by a hunter's gun? A hunt takes place when there is a
chance buffalo (more correctly, bison) will wander onto
Montana ranchlands. Because they can carry brucellosis, which
causes cattle to abort if they come into contact with the
fresh afterbirth of an aborted bison fetus, ranchers are
understandably concerned if bison cross the boundary.
   But buffalo do not recognize boundaries. Their "captivity"
inside the park goes against their migratory nature. When
stressed by severe winters, nature prevails. They have left
the park periodically over the years, although never in such
great numbers as two winters ago when 569 -- half the herd --
were shot, nor in the presence of such media coverage.
   It was February when I watched the old bull. There was a
sense of spring in the air. Perhaps, I thought, we'll make it
through the winter with no hunt beyond the one buffalo shot
early in the season. But within a few weeks there was new
snow, and 20 bison left the park near West Yellowstone. The
hunt was on, and off, and on again as bison wandered back and
forth across the border. "Probably the number of animals
taken this year will be quite small," said John Cada,
regional wildlife manager for the Montana Department of Fish,
Wildlife and Parks. "If you can sting them a little when they
first come out," he explained, "they're more apt to go back.
If you let them lounge around, they begin to think of the
area as home. It's easier to keep them out of a new area than
run them out of home."
   In mid-March three bison were shot. Animal-rights
activists were on the scene to disrupt the event. Two
protesters were arrested, one on charges of misdemeanor
assault, the other for interfering with a lawful hunt. The
activists called their cohorts' behavior "inappropriate," but
reiterated their belief that the real crime is killing bison.
After that hunt the protesters tried herding bison back into
Yellowstone. Park officials warned them away, saying the
attempt constituted harassment of wild animals, which could
not be permitted in the park.
   It probably wouldn't have had much effect anyway. While
some bison can be moved for short periods of time, basically
bison will go only where bison want to go. Numerous attempts
to keep them in the park -- hazing, cattle guards, fences,
recorded wolf-howls, sirens, tin-can rattles and cracker
shells, flashing lights, rubber bullets -- have not worked.
Besides that, any plan designed to keep animals in the park
runs counter to park policy of keeping animals wild by
allowing them natural movement through their natural habitat.
   "Just as no one is saying we should keep all the elk in
the park, no one should be saying bison must be kept in the
park," said Ed Lewis, executive director of the Bozeman-based
Greater Yellowstone Coalition. "Yellowstone has the only
free-roaming bison population and any management plan must
allow for it to continue."
   GYC has been instrumental in initiating the possibility of
a viable management plan by bringing together the Park
Service, U.S. Forest Service and the Dept. of Fish, Wildlife
and Parks, the agencies that deal with bison in the
ecosystem. They also have succeeded in getting the agencies'
agreement to maintain a core herd of 200 to 300 bison,
enough, according to park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo, that
visitors will see bison herds in the park.
   Shooting a buffalo isn't really terrific sport. It's sort
of like shooting a cow. "They are pastoral animals," said
Bozeman sculptor Brian Persha, who is outraged at the hunt's
denial of the buffalo's nature. Mr. Persha, who feels that
GYC's attempt to find an alternative to the hunt must be
supported, is donating proceeds from the sale of his work to
them. Making multiples of his sculpture for the first time,
Mr. Persha has created three bronzes, one of them a small,
reclining buffalo. Resting, waiting, eternal, his buffalo is
an eloquent statement of that great animal's quiet power.
   It is also one approach to what, at times, seems an
impossibly polarized problem -- to shoot or not to shoot.
"Population control has to happen," the wildlife department's
Mr. Cada said, "either by ranger or other hunters, or
rounding them up and selling them to the slaughterhouses.
Thirty years ago we were doing the same thing with elk. For a
similar reason. We didn't have a place for those Yellowstone
elk. Even though it took us a few years, our goal was to
acquire key pieces of winter range. We'll still hunt elk, but
instead of a firing line at the park boundary, we can manage
them.
   "I look at this as an opportunity. Things have to be major
to get support and we're talking about a major commitment
from society. We hope that society says, `Hey, I'm willing to
put my money where my mouth is and authorize Congress to buy
range out of the park.'"
   Leaving the old bull at Rescue Creek, I drove on to the
Lamar Valley. Broad, wild, silent, filled with light and
time, the valley opens before you as you come out of Lamar
Canyon like some primeval dream of land. It was here that the
Buffalo Ranch was established in 1907, five years after
captive herds of plains buffalo were introduced into
Yellowstone in an attempt to reestablish a wild herd. The
remnant of the wild mountain buffalo that had always lived in
Yellowstone mingled and prospered under the improved
protection that came with the newcomers. The experiment
successful, the ranch was disbanded in the 1950s. Lamar is
one of three winter ranges now used by Yellowstone's buffalo.
   The Lamar River ran dark and sparkling between banks of
wind-polished snow. Groups of buffalo were spread along its
length, their tracks crisscrossing the broad flats extending
south and east of the river. Wherever the animals had
stopped, the snow was churned, scuffed, pocked and pawed.
Buffalo are as evident where they are not as where they are.
   The road through Lamar is one of the few park roads that
is plowed. Not many cars had passed as I watched the buffalo,
but as I drove back, I found myself in a traffic jam.
Buffalo, larger than my car, walked up and down the middle of
the road, then ran across it, stopped on the opposite side,
returned to the road, crossed back and, finally, ran a few
feet alongside the road before disappearing from my view
behind a small rise. How thoroughly this place is theirs, I
thought.
