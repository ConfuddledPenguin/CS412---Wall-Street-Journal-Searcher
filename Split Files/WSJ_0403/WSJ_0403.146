   More and More Lawns
   Are Going Organic

   ECOLOGICALLY correct yard-care products and services are
springing up like weeds.
   Only about 1% of pesticides are put on lawns, but they
raise special concerns. Children play the most on grass, and
they're "the subgroup of the population most susceptible" to
toxins, notes Susan Cooper, an ecologist with the National
Coalition Against Misuse of Pesticides, an environmental
group. Last week, the U.S. General Accounting Office
underscored concerns by charging that the lawn-care industry
exaggerates pesticide safety.
   Organic offerings include everything from books, such as
"The Chemical-Free Lawn," published last year by Rodale
Press, to rapidly biodegradable pesticides. Rincon-Vitova
Insectories Inc., Oak View, Calif., says its aphid-eating
ladybugs and other insect stand-ins for chemicals are flying
off the shelf.
   NaturaLawn Inc., a Damascus, Md., organic lawn-care
concern, "had to {temporarily} cut off sales last year
because we couldn't handle all the business we were getting,"
says Phil Catron, president. NaturaLawn occasionally uses
chemical herbicide on some tenacious weeds, Mr. Catron says.
But part of the organic approach, he adds, "is educating
people that having a few weeds is not that big a deal."
   Mainstream yard-care concerns also are getting into the
act.
   ChemLawn Services Corp., Columbus, Ohio, says it's
test-marketing a program that uses manure for fertilizer and
no pesticides. Bartlett Tree Experts Co., Stamford, Conn.,
offers an option featuring precisely timed spraying and
pest-attacking insects. The method cuts chemical use by more
than 90%, says Donald Booth, a Bartlett manager.

   Enlisting a Clay Pit
   To Store Solar Energy
                                                                                                       

   ENGINEERS at the University of Massachusetts are planning
a solar energy system based on clay.
   The team plans to capture heat from the sun during the
summer with solar collectors and use it to warm a
100-foot-deep clay deposit near the school's Amherst, Mass.,
campus. In winter, the stored energy would provide as much as
80% of the heating for a new convention center near campus.
   The technique, which could overcome the difficulty of
storing solar energy, was explored by the the U.S. Department
of Energy in the 1970s as a way to heat homes, says team
leader Edward Sunderland. But heat leaked out of the
relatively small systems too fast. The Amherst system's much
larger 100,000-cubic-meter clay deposit is expected to retain
and give back more than 85% of its stored heat, says team
member Dwayne Breger.
   The system would employ six acres of solar collectors
similar to rooftop water heaters. The collectors would heat
water, which would be pumped through underground pipes lacing
the clay to warm it. In winter, the warm clay would heat
water to 140 degrees Fahrenheit before it is pumped to the
convention center.
   The system's estimated cost of about $3.5 million would be
repaid by fuel savings in five to seven years, Mr. Breger
projects. The engineers, whose design work was funded by the
DOE, now are seeking funds to build the system. It would be a
U.S. first, but some 30 such systems already have been built
in Europe, they say.
                                                                                                       

   Ecology Groups Waver
   Over Seals of Approval
                                                                                                       

   IT'S A FAUSTIAN dilemma that's shaping up for some
environmental groups.
   Many of them recently have been approached by retailers
and other concerns proposing to use the groups' names and
logos in product promotions. The companies are offering
royalties or other kinds of payment and a chance for the
groups to spread their messages among consumers. "Right now,
we're being deluged" with such proposals, says Rosemary
Carroll, the Sierra Club's director of development.
   Some groups already make such deals: The Audubon Society
licenses its name to makers of binoculars and birdseed. Black
Sheep Marketing Inc., New York, pays a 25% royalty to the
Rainforest Alliance to use its name in inserts with shower
curtains picturing rain forests. The World Wildlife Fund has
licensed its name to a maker of T-shirts featuring endangered
species.
   But other groups are wrestling with issues raised by the
proposals and haven't yet decided how to handle them. "Our
name could lose all meaning if we don't protect how it is
used," says Ms. Carroll of the Sierra Club, which is now
developing a policy on the matter. For example, she adds, the
group probably won't sign a pact with a company that wants to
promote its plastic-free tampons with the Sierra Club.
                                                                                                       

   Introducing the Annual
   `Green Con Award'
                                                                                                       

   THE LONDON OFFICE of Friends of the Earth has initiated an
annual "Green Con Award."
   The environmental group wants to spotlight examples of
"companies jumping on the green bandwagon when in fact they
are talking gibberish," says a Friends spokeswoman. The first
winner was British Nuclear Fuels PLC for "railing about how
green nuclear power is," she says.
   A British Nuclear spokesman says its recently developed ad
campaign stresses that nuclear plants, unlike conventional
plants, don't pollute the air. "We maintain nuclear power
could contribute to lessening the greenhouse effect," he
says.
   He added that "we don't agree with the criticism that we
are deceiving people. But we derived some amusement from the
award. We would have displayed the trophy in the press
office, but it's so hideous nobody wanted it."
