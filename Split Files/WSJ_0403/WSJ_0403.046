   Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, widely considered one of
the New England banks least vulnerable to the region's real
estate problems, said it will post a sharp increase in
troubled loans.
   The Providence, R.I. bank holding company estimated that
nonperforming assets grew 50% to $600 million at the end of
the first quarter, and indicated that a continuing
examination by state and federal regulators may well result
in further increases.

   Fitch Investors Service yesterday warned that
Fleet/Norstar's troubled assets could reach $875 million, or
about 4% of related assets, compared with $400 million, or
1.8%, at Dec. 31.
   Jack Flynn, executive vice president and chief financial
officer at Fleet/Norstar, said that and similar estimates by
other analysts -- ranging from $700 million to $1 billion --
have been made by comparing the size of Fleet/Norstar's
commercial real estate portfolio with those of banks that
have been examined recently. Asked to comment on Fitch's
estimate, Mr. Flynn said, "I hope they're wrong."
   Fleet/Norstar's disclosure marks the latest in a string of
setbacks for New England's biggest banks that began last
fall, as federal examiners started scouring the banks'
commercial real estate portfolios. Partly because
Fleet/Norstar curtailed condominium-construction loans in
1987 and has an unusually diversified earnings base, analysts
say it is likely to remain less affected than others by the
region's real-estate slump. But yesterday's announcement
shows that the bank, the region's second largest with $33
billion in total assets, is far from immune to the region's
general malaise.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Fleet/Norstar's shares fell 62.5 cents to close at $21.25, on
heavy volume of more than 1.8 million, following the early
morning announcement. Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
yesterday lowered ratings on a number of Fleet/Norstar's debt
securities, citing the spreading problems in commercial real
estate.
   Even if Fitch's estimate of problem loans proves accurate,
Fleet/Norstar would remain better off than its major New
England competitors. At year-end 1989, nonperforming assets
were 5.4% of related assets for Shawmut National Corp., 6.6%
for Bank of Boston Corp., the region's largest bank, and 9.5%
for Bank of New England Corp.
   Thaddeus Paluszek, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.,
said the growth in troubled loans at Fleet/Norstar isn't
"disastrous." He added, "That's a sizable increase. But I
think it has to be framed in a context that is relative to
other New England banks. I don't think a financial
institution in a soft economic environment can be totally
immune."
   Fleet/Norstar said it may delay reporting first-quarter
results, normally announced in mid-April, if regulatory
examinations of its operating units aren't finished by then.
The company said the exams are expected to be completed by
the end of the month.
   Mr. Flynn said that most of the estimated increase in
nonperforming assets comes from real estate loans in the
company's banking subsidiaries. "The key real estate
portfolios are {in the} Providence and Buffalo" units, Mr.
Flynn said, adding that "we haven't gotten much feedback"
from the regulators on those units yet.
   Although Fleet/Norstar was examined just last fall, U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke said earlier this
year that his agency wanted to take a closer look at the
company's real estate portfolios in light of the continued
deterioration in the Northeast market.
   At the time, Mr. Clarke said Fleet/Norstar had expressed
interest in possibly buying banking units from troubled Bank
of New England, but that he wouldn't be able to approve such
a transaction until Fleet/Norstar had been examined again.
   Mr. Flynn said yesterday that the anticipated increase in
problem loans "will not affect our interest and we do not
believe it will affect our ability" to buy other banking
units. But "those are things you have to look at constantly
and continue to make judgments as to where you stand," he
said.
   Mr. Paluszek of Kidder Peabody said the company might be
better off not buying parts of Bank of New England now. "My
pesonal feeling is {Fleet/Norstar} would be better served to
maintain its position and mind its own store rather than
expand its position in a soft market."
   Meanwhile, Fleet/Norstar moved to cushion itself against a
possible increase in its loan-loss reserves, which stood at
$341 million, or 86% of nonperforming assets at year end.
   Mr. Flynn said the company will record a pretax gain in
the first quarter of about $40 million from the sale of $200
million of its $450 million credit-card portfolio to Norwest
Corp., Minneapolis. The company also will have a pretax gain
of about $50 million from a change in the investment
structure of its pension plan, Mr. Flynn said.
   A number of banks recently have sold credit-card
portfolios to larger servicers, and Fleet said maintaining
its relatively small portfolio "would place us at a
disadvantage with respect to cost economies." Mr. Flynn said
the company plans to retain the $150 million in credit-card
accounts belonging to people who have other banking
relationships with Fleet/Norstar. But "we may well sell" the
remaining $100 million or so of the portfolio in the second
quarter, he said.
