   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. said it
expects a first-quarter loss of $897 million to $917 million
-- a securities-industry record -- as it finally pays the
bill for some of its overexpansion in the 1980s.
   In a series of announcements, the nation's second-biggest
securities firm said it is dissolving its troubled Balcor Co.
real-estate unit; closing 67 of its U.S. branch offices;
ceasing the creation of limited-partnership investments;
pulling back from international operations; and attempting to
sell its investment portfolio of high-yield "junk" bonds,
which it values at $480 million.

   The moves, many of them expected, are part of the American
Express Co. unit's effort to pare itself back to a manageable
size. They culminate months of turmoil at Shearson as the
brokerage firm scrambled to head off a threatened downgrading
of its credit ratings. Last week, to enable the big charges
against earnings, Shearson received a cash infusion of $750
million from American Express, which currently owns 61% of
Shearson and is in the process of acquiring the rest of
Shearson's common shares outstanding.
   Included in Shearson's loss are charges against earnings
totaling $787 million. Shearson's charge against earnings to
pay for the retrenchment plan will be about $630 million,
Shearson said. That's the biggest such charge in
securities-industry history, topping Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s
$470 million pretax fourth-quarter charge to pay for that
firm's own retrenchment plan. Shearson is also taking a $157
million charge to reflect a change in how
software-development costs are accounted for. Neither of
Shearson's charges have immediate tax benefits.
   With the record charge-offs, Shearson becomes the latest
big Wall Street securities firm to take harsh financial
measures to adapt to the deep recession in the securities
industry. The slump has produced layoffs of nearly 45,000
employees nationwide since the 1987 stock-market crash and
hastened the collapse of one major firm, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc.
   Just last week, General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody
Group Inc. unit announced a recapitalization that enabled GE
to inject $550 million in cash into Kidder, partly through
the sale of Kidder's junk-bond inventory to its parent. Other
firms such as CS First Boston Inc. have also had to turn to
their parents to bolster them.
   The major credit-rating agencies responded favorably to
Shearson's latest moves, with both Moody's Investors Service
Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. affirming Shearson's credit
ratings.
   Yet those affirmations aren't resounding, say analysts.
The affirmations are based mostly on deep-pocketed American
Express's shows of support for its unit, rather than optimism
about Shearson's prospects. "Shearson's ratings are now even
more dependent on Amex than they were before," said Jeffrey
Bowman, an S&amp;P vice president. Shearson's "capital levels
remain low relative to the company's asset mix," he said.
   As previously reported, Shearson would have had a loss for
the first quarter even without the restructuring. In
yesterday's announcements, the firm said it sustained an
operating loss for the quarter of between $110 million and
$130 million, which it blamed on an overall slowdown in
business and "industry conditions" during January and
February. Operating revenue at Shearson improved in March,
the firm said.
   Shearson officials, in interviews and in discussions with
employees yesterday, tried to portray the firm as having a
bright future now that it has bitten the bullet on its
financial problems.
   Howard L. Clark Jr., the former American Express chief
financial officer recently installed as Shearson's chairman
and chief executive, said in an interview: "We have
aggressively moved forward on this, addressing the balance
sheet of the company. I think, as they say at American
Express, we're ahead of the curve, by aggressively focusing
on the balance sheet. Now we want to focus on profitability."
   But some analysts expressed concern that Shearson's
problems aren't necessarily over. "They've gone and very
carefully looked at financing requirements, looked at the
operating needs," said John Keefe, financial services analyst
at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New York. But "it's beyond
anyone's capabilities to say this is a sufficient provision.
It's anybody's guess, because market conditions are still so
fragile."
   Indeed, while Shearson said it will have more than $2
billion in equity capital after the write-downs, S&amp;P
calculates the firm's "tangible" net capital as around $400
million -- and said that level "provides marginal cushion
against operating and other risks, such as the company's
sizable $500 million bridge loan to Prime Computer Inc.
Shearson's capital levels could further weaken if first
quarter operating losses and modest junk bond markdowns
continue."
   In the interview, Mr. Clark said there are no plans for
additional mass layoffs at Shearson after the round of 2,000
job cuts announced in late February and being completed now.
And he sought to dispel speculation that American Express is
merely trying to get Shearson on its feet as a precursor to
selling the firm. Shearson may indeed one day be sold, say
analysts, but Mr. Clark said it wouldn't be in the near
future.
   "I was not sent down to Shearson by American Express to
fix it, package it and sell it; I was sent to run it," Mr.
Clark said. He added: "But I think speculation about what
might happen three, four, five years from now is irrelevant
to the process."
   James D. Robinson III -- the American Express chairman who
in January ousted Peter A. Cohen as Shearson's chief and
replaced him with Mr. Clark -- said in a statement that the
Shearson announcements "signal the start of a new era for the
firm." He said that "Howard Clark and his team have our full
support as they move to reduce Shearson's risk profile and
get back to basics by focusing on the things they do best."
   The statement emphasized American Express's view that
Shearson's woes are byproducts of Shearson's aggressive
expansion in the 1980s under Mr. Cohen. This expansion
included the purchase -- ill-advised, Mr. Robinson now says
-- of ailing broker E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. just after the stock
market crash.
   Shearson's large role in selling limited partnership
investments, a Hutton specialty, is also being fingered these
days as a mistake. That's why Shearson now says it will no
longer originate any partnership investments, although it
will still sell other firms' investments if a client wants
it. Shearson had been the biggest purveyor of limited
partnership investments in 1988, before cutting back.
   Mr. Clark was blunt about Shearson's stumbles in limited
partnerships, many of which have gone sour and led to
investor lawsuits against the company. The partnerships'
troubles were exacerbated by tax-law changes that took away
tax-shelter benefits, and problems with partnerships aren't
confined to Shearson. Still, Mr. Clark said that in
retrospect, "I don't think we controlled the quality of the
partnerships we sold adequately. . . . Wall Street in general
has done a lousy job of selecting and selling limited
partnerships."
   Many of the partnerships now dogging Shearson were sold by
the Skokie, Ill.based Balcor unit, a real-estate operation
that represents the antithesis of the "basics" that American
Express now stresses for Shearson.
   Of the $630 million restructuring charge, about $200
million is for estimated losses at Balcor as it pulls out of
all commercial real-estate activities and the origination of
limited partnerships, and sells its portfolio of loans.
Shearson retained Edward S. Gordon Co. to direct the winding
down of Balcor.
   The restructuring charge also includes about $170 million
in expenses to consolidate corporate office facilities and
shut 67 of Shearson's 500 branches, and about $60 million to
close certain international offices. And about $45 million of
the charge is for severance costs after the 2,000 layoffs.
   Finally, about $115 million of the charge reflects losses
to be taken in the planned sale of the $480 million in junk
bonds, which includes $290 million in mutual funds.
