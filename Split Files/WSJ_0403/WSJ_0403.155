   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Fairfield Communities Inc., as part
of a restructuring, plans to sell several businesses
including its Home Group operations in Florida and southern
Arizona, its joint venture investments in the U.S. Virgin
Islands and the amenity and commercial operations of its
resort group.
   The company said the sale of discontinued operations
resulted in a $22.9 million charge against 1989 earnings.

   The announcement of the restructuring came as the
developer of retirement and recreational communities
announced it had sustained a fourth-quarter loss of $5.6
million, or 52 cents a share, on revenue of $58.2 million.
For the same period a year earlier, the company reported a
loss on continuing operations of $1.7 million, or 15 cents a
share, on revenue of $52.9 million.
   For 1989, the company posted a loss from continuing
operations of $1.8 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue
of $240.3 million, down from a gain from continuing
operations of $2.2 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue
of $210.4 million the year earlier. The company said the
fourth-quarter results reflected damage by Hurricane Hugo to
six company-owned resorts in the Carolinas. The results also
included nonrecurring losses of $3.9 million from discounting
contract receivables and the sale of mortgage receivables at
a discount.
   Also during the fourth quarter, the company said it
incurred a charge of $2.7 million for expenses of continuing
operations associated with attempted financings, a reserve
for litigation and an increase in the allowance for
cancellation of contract receivables for two discontinued
projects.
