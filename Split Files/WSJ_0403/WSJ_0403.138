   Communications Transmission Inc., Austin, Texas, announced
the expiration of waivers it had been granted by senior and
subordinated lenders on certain financial and other covenants
under its $156.7 million credit agreement and its $103
million subordinated debt agreement.
   The microwave and fiber-optic communications operator said
that it is current on interest payments due to its senior
lenders, but that it hadn't made the quarterly and semiannual
interest payments that were due yesterday to its subordinated
lender.
