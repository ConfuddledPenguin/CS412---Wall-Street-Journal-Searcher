   We are tempted beyond endurance, so we hereby
enthusiastically cheer passage of Pennsylvania's proposed
anti-takeover, anti-proxy bill. It is indeed an awful piece
of legislation. Just yesterday, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden
warned that Pennsylvania's bill would "shield management from
investor oversight," and he threatened to use federal laws to
invalidate parts of the bill. Nonetheless, in the interest of
financial science, we say bring it on.
   There is nothing like federalism's 50 petrie dishes to
show which state corporate laws attract capital and jobs and
which spook investors and handicap local economies.
Pennsylvania is about to make the ultimate sacrifice on
behalf of this knowledge.

   At the moment, it looks as if managers of companies
incorporated in Pennsylvania -- fourth among the Fortune 500
-- will get full defenses against any market or stockholder
pressures. The bill speeding through the legislature this
week would disgorge the profit from a stockholder who sells
within 18 months of launching any kind of bid for the
company. This is pure expropriation.
   Moreover, instead of the ancient duty to maximize share
price, directors fighting off bids could consider the
interests of "stakeholders" (employees, suppliers and the
like) above the interests of stockholders. Fiduciary duty,
RIP.
   The most extraordinary feature of the bill is that it
would even make proxy contests, which are always difficult,
prohibitively expensive. The bill says that anyone -- except
managers -- who initiates a proxy must be prepared to buy the
company at a price set by a judge. This provision applies
even if the proxy is not to take over the company but only,
say, to change accounting firms. Any stockholder who launches
a proxy and solicits 20% of the votes would have to tender
for all shares.
   You might wonder why the country's most radical
anti-takeover bill comes during a lull in the takeover
battles and the problems in the junk-bond market. The
explanation -- as with nearly all the prior state legislation
-- is that this bill is to benefit one particular firm
against an out-of-state bidder. Here, Pennsylvania's
Armstrong World Industries has been eyed by the Belzberg
family of Canada.
   Not everyone is happy with the prospect of corporate
protectionism and permanently entrenched managers becoming a
way of life in the Keystone state. The head of investing for
Pennsylvania's own $9.6 billion State Employees' Retirement
System says that if the bill passes he'll oppose any more
investments in companies incorporated in the state. "I could
not invest another penny in them because of my legal duties
to present and future retirees," Kenneth Mertz told state
legislators. "We should not have a law that prevents me from
investing our retirement funds in Pennsylvania companies --
money that belongs to Pennsylvanians."
   Opponents of the bill point to a letter from a regional
office of the Federal Trade Commission and its Bureau of
Economics. It notes that studies by the SEC and others have
shown that share prices fall after enactment of state
anti-takeover bills. Share prices dropped by 1% in New York,
2% in Ohio and between 4% and 6% in Indiana. Prices seem to
fall in proportion to the severity of the legislation, so
Pennsylvania shares could tumble even more.
   But as we say, Pennsylvania is perfectly free to pass any
legislation it likes now that the Supreme Court has chosen
not to invalidate these laws. As social experiments go, we
can't think of many more important than determining the costs
of draconian legal barriers to takeovers and proxy battles.
To this end, Pennsylvania is about to enact a very bad bill.
