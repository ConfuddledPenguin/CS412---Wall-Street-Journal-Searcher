   The way health experts are going,
   With changes in their points of view,
   Very soon we may be hearing
   That asbestos is good for you.

   Deliverance
                                                                                                       

   Unanswered letters, unpaid bills
   No longer bring guilt-feeling chills;
   I face complaints calmly, not nervous,
   Like most, I blame the Postal Service.
   -- Bern Sharfman.
