   WOODBURY, N.Y. -- Cablevision Systems Corp. said it
entered a 10-year, $1.15 billion credit facility with a group
of banks jointly led by Citibank and Toronto Dominion Bank.
   The new facility represents a $250 million increase from
the parent company's existing facility and is expected to
close within 30 days, Cablevision said. A spokesman said the
cash would be used for working capital. He declined to
elaborate.

   Analysts suggested the funds could be used to finance
Cablevision's plan to acquire Gateway Cable from Gilbert
Media Associates L.P. Announced last December, the $102.5
million transaction is expected to close next month and would
give Cablevision an additional 40,000 subscribers. The
company's affiliated systems currently have a 1.5
million-subscriber base.
   The funds also might be put toward Cablevision's
involvement in the Sky Cable plan, announced early this year,
analysts said. Cablevision will spend $75 million over four
years in a joint venture with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,
General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Communications unit, and
General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit.
