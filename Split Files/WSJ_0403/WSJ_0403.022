   TAIPEI -- Taiwan's cabinet approved regulations filed by
the Finance Ministry concerning new bank establishments.
   Under the rules, the minimum paid-in capital for new banks
will be $10 billion New Taiwan ($378.8 million) and each new
bank will be required to raise 20% of its paid-in capital
from a public offering on the stock market, with each
investor limited to 10,000 shares.

   The new regulations also indicated that the ministry may
have the right to restrict the number of new banks.
   The new rules came after the government's decision in July
to lift a ban on formation of new banks, officials said.
