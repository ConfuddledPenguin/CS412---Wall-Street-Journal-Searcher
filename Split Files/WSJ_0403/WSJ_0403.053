   The three-month long collapse of the Japanese stock market
continued yesterday. The Nikkei Index fell 6.59% Monday after
dropping 3.37% on Friday. Monday's plunge was the second
worst in the history of the Tokyo exchange, and may well mark
the end of one of the most spectacular bull markets in recent
history. It also reminds us that the Japanese are, after all,
governed by the same economic forces as the rest of the human
race.
   In the five years between December 1984 and December 1989,
the Nikkei Index rose 237% and the yen rose 75%. In dollars,
the market provided a 42.7% compound annual rate of return.
The rise in stock prices far outpaced corporate earnings,
pushing the price-earnings ratio to a stratospheric 53 by the
end of 1987. (The U.S. ratio was then 14.4.)

   The Tokyo market's rise was propelled by the swift drop in
Japan's import bill. Slumping oil prices -- a barrel that
cost an average of $29.37 in 1984 was available for an
average of $16.42 in 1986 -- helped improve Japan's terms of
trade by 33.7% over those two years. In yen terms, Japan
spent 4% less on imports in 1985 than it had in 1984, and 31%
less in 1986 than it had in 1985. It takes a long time for a
highly competitive economy to respond to changes of this
magnitude. It took Japan even longer.
   While the Japanese wholesale price index fell by 1.1% in
1985 and 9.1% in 1986, the consumer price index rose by 2% in
1985 and 0.6% in 1986. Meanwhile, real wages grew only 0.7%
in 1985 and 2.3% in 1986. Clearly, someone else in the
country was reaping the major benefits of the oil price drop.
   That someone was the corporate sector. Because consumers
and workers enjoyed little improvement in their incomes in
1984-1986, they were unable to increase their consumption of
foreign goods. Japan's current account surplus was achieved
by denying the Japanese worker and consumer the benefits of
the country's increased income. Japan's current account
surplus grew to $86 billion in 1986 from $35 billion in 1984.
This large increase in the inflow of funds must, by the rules
of national income accounting, be counterbalanced by an
outflow through the nation's capital account or an increase
in the reserves of the central bank.
   So money was pouring into the country. Instead of causing
increased spending on imports, it stayed in the corporate
sector. Comparatively cheap stocks, bonds and real estate
abroad lured it back out of the country, this time through
the capital account.
   Now place yourself in the position of a Japanese
institutional investor in 1986. Historically, the Japanese
stock market has been a better investment than foreign
markets. In any case, you have little experience investing
abroad and you tend to make decisions by committee. Your own
market has been going up and the U.S. dollar has fallen in
value -- to 153 yen by August 1986 from 264 yen in February
1985 -- depreciating all of your foreign investments.
   Foreign brokers come to you on a weekly basis and explain
to you that P-E ratios are important and Japan is overvalued,
but all you see is that your Japanese investments increase in
value and your foreign investments fall in value. No wonder
you continue to purchase Japanese investments even though you
may suspect that you should pay attention to standard
international comparisons of value.
   This pricing disequilibrium could continue as long as
Japan ran large current account surpluses. Because the amount
of money that had to be channeled abroad was so large, and
because the Japanese were new to the international investment
scene, a huge difference emerged between the valuation of
Japanese assets and those in the rest of the world.
   So far, the story corresponds to the worst worries of the
"the Japanese are different]" school of thought. But not for
long. Out of sight of the protectionists in the U.S.
Congress, the Japanese political economy was changing
dramatically. First, in a misguided attempt to control
exchange rates, then Secretary of the Treasury James Baker
pressured Japan into abandoning its prudent management of
monetary affairs in order to stabilize the dollar at the
Louvre in February 1987. The growth in the Japanese money
supply, until then a steady, non-inflationary 7% to 8%,
suddenly accelerated to nearly 11% during 1987-89. People had
more money to spend on all goods, including imports.
   Then market forces began to make themselves felt in Japan.
The long-suffering worker and consumer started to receive
some benefits: Real wages increased 3.3% in 1988 and about
2.4% in 1989. Due largely to the huge increase in the yen's
value, import volumes swelled dramatically, rising 37.5%
between 1986 and 1989. Japan's vaunted export machine was
able to achieve only a 9.5% increase in export volumes over
the same period.
   The current account surplus stopped growing, and then
actually began to shrink. After rocketing upward to a peak of
$87 billion in 1987 from its 1985 level of $49.2 billion, the
surplus should fall to about $40 billion this year.
   This is the fundamental cause of the collapse of the
Japanese stock market. The liquidity buildup caused by the
current account surplus is disappearing as the higher income
Japan earned in the 1980s finally gets spent by the labor
force. All the other forces to which the fall has been
attributed are simply manifestations of this one fundamental
fact.
   For example, the president of the Bank of Japan Yasushi
Mieno has raised interest rates in order to hold up the value
of the yen and reduce inflation. He was impelled to do so
first, by the reduction in investable funds because of the
decline of the current account surplus, and, second, because
of the excessive monetary growth after the Louvre Accord. At
first, excessive liquidity helped to fuel the overvaluation
of Japanese securities. It is now the cause of the downward
pressure on the yen and the upward pressure on inflation.
Japan, like Britain, is a victim of the macroeconomic
imbalances caused by trying to fix an exchange rate at the
wrong level.
   The Ministry of Finance may indeed, as Japan's critics
speculate, try to manipulate its rules and force major
financial institutions into maintaining the value of the
stock market, and it may briefly succeed. All the same, the
market will ultimately have to recede to more normal
valuations. What level would be normal?
   In 1985, Japanese domestic inflation was 2%, the current
account surplus was $49 billion, interest rates averaged
5.9%, the price of oil was $28 per barrel and the market
finished the year on a P-E ratio of 26. In 1989, inflation
was 2.3% and probably rising, while the current account
surplus was $57 billion and falling. Interest rates are now
touching 7.2% and the price of oil is $20 per barrel.
   In short, the major macroeconomic statistics are roughly
equivalent to those of 1985 -- but in 1985 they were trending
up and today they are trending down. The Nikkei would have to
fall to the 18,000 to 20,000 range for equities to return to
a P-E ratio of 26. (Japanese ratios ought to be higher than
those of the U.S. because of the higher rates of economic and
productivity growth expected in Japan.)
   Taken by themselves, the implications for the U.S. market
from a fall in the Japanese are not that great. If your
neighbor's house were inadvertently valued at a price triple
that of other similar houses in your area, it would do you no
harm when the price anomaly was corrected. The repricing of
the Japanese stock market is merely one effect of the
dwindling Japanese current account. A few of the other
predictable effects are a reduction in the U.S. trade
deficit, a weaker yen and less Japanese direct investment
abroad. If the U.S. stock market falls, it will be because of
the severe monetary squeeze which the U.S. economy is
currently undergoing, and not because of the slump in Tokyo
prices.
   The Japanese market has been an enigma for foreign
investors for the past five years. It effortlessly went from
one new high to another in contravention of all the rules
about investing that apply outside of Japan. This was
genuinely peculiar behavior, but it could not last.
Eventually Japan's market had to obey the same rules that
govern investment everywhere else in the world.
