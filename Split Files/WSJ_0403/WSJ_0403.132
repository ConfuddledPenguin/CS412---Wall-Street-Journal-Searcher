   N.V. Amev, the third-largest Dutch insurance company, and
Groupe AG, Belgium's biggest insurer, announced plans to
merge, creating Europe's 12th-largest insurer in terms of
premium income. A final pact is expected before year end.
   Amev and Groupe each would own 50% of a joint venture,
with operating units initially separate, designed to
strengthen both as the European Community moves toward freer
cross-border competition. Groupe would pay 10.7 billion
Belgian francs ($305.3 million) to Amev over 10 years to
cover the difference in Amev's greater value. The two
parents, which also have moved into banking, would keep
separate stock market quotations.

   The combined companies would have annual revenue of about
$7 billion, assets of $35 billion, and shareholders' equity,
including unrealized gains on assets, of $4 billion. They
have a combined stock market value of about $4.6 billion.
   Amev posted a 28% rise in 1989 profit to 354.8 million
guilders ($186 million), or 5.78 guilders a share, from 276.2
million guilders, or 4.97 guilders a share, in 1988.
