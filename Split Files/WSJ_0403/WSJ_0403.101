   DALLAS -- Trammell Crow Co., as part of an ongoing
restructuring of its debt and operations, completed a $456
million refinancing deal with Equitable Real Estate
Management Inc.
   While the deal is well shy of the $600 million that
Trammell Crow originally sought from Equitable Real Estate,
it will enable the giant real estate developer to cut the
interest it pays on the debt by almost 2.5 percentage points,
while injecting badly needed cash into poorly performing
projects in the Southwest.

   The bulk of the financing will be used to pay off existing
debt on about 90 Trammell Crow properties, which will be
pledged as collateral for the new debt. About $90 million in
remaining cash will be used to pay down Trammell Crow's debt
on another 60 properties that have been unprofitable,
according to Robert Whitman, chief financial officer for
Trammell Crow.
   When the company first approached Equitable Real Estate
about a year ago, it had hoped to clear about $113 million in
cash to pay down the debt on 100 ailing projects. Mr. Whitman
said that list was pared to 60 through the sales of some
properties and improvements in market conditions. Other
properties were rejected by Equitable Real Estate because of
environmental problems, and still others were mortgaged by
lenders who were unwilling to accept an early pay down, Mr.
Whitman said.
   The refinancing with Equitable Real Estate will enable
Trammell Crow to reduce its interest rates from 11.3% to
about 8.8%, Mr. Whitman said. The deal will also put about
10% of Trammell Crow's Southwest projects in the hands of a
single lender and one that has financed Crow projects since
the early 1950s.
   The properties involved in the Equitable deal were
originally financed by some 30 lenders, many of whom are now
feeling pressure from federal regulators to reduce their
exposure to real estate losses. And the stock market added
pressure of its own in early March, when rumors of loan
defaults by Trammell Crow drove down stock prices of some
large bank holding companies.
   Equitable Real Estate President Douglas A. Tibbetts said
the pressures didn't shake his company's commitment to the
refinancing.
   "Despite the rumors that came out recently, we maintained
our comfort level," he said.
   The financing is being provided by the general account of
Equitable Real Estate's parent, Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the U.S., and is the second large refinancing hat
the company has done for Trammell Crow. In 1987, Equitable
Real Estate refinanced the Dallas Market Center for $450
million.
   The properties covered by the current refinancing are
predominately in Texas, Arizona and Colorado, and 70% of them
are industrial or warehouse buildings. About 20% of the
properties are retail centers and the remainder is made up of
office buildings.
   The properties involved in the deal represent about 3% of
Trammell Crow's national holdings of about $15 billion in
real estate. The company ranks as the nation's largest
residential builder and second largest commercial builder.
