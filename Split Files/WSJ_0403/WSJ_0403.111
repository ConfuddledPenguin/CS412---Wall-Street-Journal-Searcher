   CPC International Inc., a food products company based in
Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said it completed the purchase of
three food businesses in Britain from SmithKline Beecham PLC,
a pharmaceutical and consumer-product concern, for #157
million ($258.7 million).
   The purchase includes the Ambrosia dessert line, including
milk puddings and custards; Bovril beef bouillon products;
and Marmite spread, an English bread spread made from yeast
extract. The three food businesses had combined sales last
year of #89 million.

   The sale of the businesses, which Beecham owned before it
merged with SmithKline Beckman last year, was expected. Early
this year, SmithKline said it was seeking to sell some of its
food brands to concentrate on strengthening its international
health-care business.
   CPC said the acquisitions complement its core business.
Its products include such brands as Skippy peanut butter,
Thomas' English muffins, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr
soups, sauces, bouillons and seasonings.
