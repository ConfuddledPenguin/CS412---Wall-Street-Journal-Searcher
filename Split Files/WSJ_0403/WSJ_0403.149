   WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department, in a long-awaited
report, is repeating its call for cuts of only about 10% in
U.S. troops in the Pacific over the next three years, setting
the stage for a likely confrontation with Congress.
   Many lawmakers had hoped the study, which Congress ordered
last year, would provide the framework and momentum for
deeper, long-term reductions in U.S. military strength in the
region. Many are pushing for cuts of 20% or more in U.S.
ground and air forces in South Korea alone, along with
comparable reductions in ships and sailors currently assigned
to the Navy's Pacific fleet.

   The Pentagon's recommendations don't go beyond proposals
to trim U.S. regional troop strength previously announced as
a first step by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, according to
congressional and Pentagon aides. The report, these aides
said, calls for removing some 14,000 of the 120,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea, Japan and the Philippines over
the next three years.
   The bulk of the proposed reductions would involve support
personnel rather than front-line combat units, persons
familiar with the report said. They added that the report
doesn't identify what additional cuts, if any, the Bush
administration is prepared to embrace in the future.
Classified summaries of the review's findings have been
provided to Capitol Hill in the last few days, and the Senate
Armed Services Committee has scheduled a hearing on the
matter later this month.
   Lawmakers who demanded the study as part of a compromise
that postponed reductions in Pacific forces planned for last
year are dissatisfied with its major findings.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.), a leader in the fight for
sweeping troop reductions in that part of the world, said in
an interview that he expects the report "to be nothing more
than a warmed-over version of what Secretary Cheney has been
saying. It's not going to have any long-term projections."
   Along with several senior members of the Senate Armed
Services and Appropriations committees, Sen. Bumper is
expected again this year to push for a floor vote on proposed
larger troop withdrawals.
   Defense panel chairman Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), who has
strongly resisted imposing such cuts on the Pentagon,
recently complained that Mr. Cheney "has not yet told us what
our force structure would look like" by the mid-1990s under
his defense blueprint.
   The Bush administration, for its part, hopes to use the
report as part of a holding action to postpone action and
retain flexibility for itself about the ultimate size and
shape of substantial cuts that seem inevitable in the
Pacific. Sharper and faster cuts than those advocated by the
report, according to Pentagon aides, could prompt questions
about U.S. staying power and reduce stability in the region.
   Mr. Cheney, who spent nearly two weeks in February
spreading that message to Pacific leaders, told a group of
newspaper publishers last week: "We can save some money by
bringing home some of the forces, but I think we're going to
want to continue to be active in the Pacific and in Europe."
   Other senior Pentagon officials go further in defending
their refusal to cut more deeply in the Pacific. Air Force
Secretary Donald Rice, for instance, said in a recent
interview that Soviet military intentions in the region
remain uncertain and "tend to fall into a different category"
than Moscow's moves to improve East-West dialogue regarding
Europe. The arms-control initiatives and massive troop
cutbacks Moscow has proposed for Europe, Mr. Rice said,
"don't have a lot to do with the Pacific."
