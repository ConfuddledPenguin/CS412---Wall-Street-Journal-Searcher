   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices fell back after three
days of advances following reports that a wildcat walkout by
workers at a Canadian mine had ended.
   The May contract ended 1.50 cents a pound lower at
$1.2090. The contract rose to its high of the day of $1.2340
just after the opening, following strength in London
generated by a severe drop in London Metal Exchange warehouse
stocks of copper. The exchange said its stocks declined
12,950 tons last week to 59,125 tons, the lowest level of
London Exchange copper inventories in almost two years. In
May 1988, 45,200 tons of copper were in store.

   Although most expectations Friday had been for a drop of
3,000 to 5,000 tons, some predicted withdrawals could amount
to much more than that, possibly to 10,000 tons or more, so
the big fall wasn't a complete surprise, analysts said.
   Its effect was quickly overcome, anyway, by a news service
report about the end of the wildcat strike at the Highland
Valley Copper mine in Logan Lake, British Columbia, analysts
said. The company spokesman was unavailable, as were details
of the settlement.
   Highland Valley machinists last Wednesday walked out in
protest over an outside contractor's use of its own laborers
while Highland Valley was laying off laborers, company
spokesman Rod Killough said on Friday. The machinists thought
the contractor should use Highland Valley laborers for that
part of its work, Mr. Killough said. Routine maintenance work
is handled by the company's staff, he said, but when special
skills are required, outside contractors are called in, he
said.
   At that time, he said the company was seeking an
injunction to force workers to return. He also noted that the
union, the United Steelworkers of America, didn't support the
walkout and was trying to get the workers to return.
   One analyst said that the May contract had a run-up of
almost six cents a pound in the previous three sessions and
that the U.S. economy was showing a generally sluggish tone.
He noted that the purchasing managers index for March was
48.8%, which was the 11th consecutive month below 50%. Also,
he said, stock markets world-wide were softer following sharp
declines in Tokyo.
   "Indications are that while there isn't a recession,
growth isn't robust either," he said. This, he said, could
have caused some traders to wonder if, when current supply
problems are solved in the copper industry, demand for copper
might slow down and influence a price drop in the second half
of the year.
   But Fred Demler, metals economist for PaineWebber, New
York, said major underlying market factors continue to
indicate support for the market, at least for the time being.
   Combined stocks of copper in London and New York exchanges
are down 50% since the start of the year, he said. During the
first two months, U.S. producer stocks are 37% lower than a
year earlier and consumer inventories have dropped 15%, he
noted.
   As for demand, world-wide consumption of copper was up 10%
in January from a year earlier, and U.S. brass and wire mill
use of copper during January and February was up 2% from the
year-earlier months, he said.
   "Reports of producer buying of copper also has helped to
firm prices," he said. "While producer buying of copper isn't
a routine thing, it isn't unheard of either. When it happened
in 1987, 1988 and 1989 it was a price-firming development
because these buyers were competing for material in a tightly
supplied market. That's what's happening now."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum futures prices were higher across the
board. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery was up
20 cents a barrel to settle at $20.48. Some fuel contracts
increased more than one cent a gallon. The May heating oil
contract gained 0.93 cent a gallon to 55.27 cents while May
gasoline rose 0.72 cent a gallon to 66.08 cents. There was
little industry news to account for the increases. Some oil
analysts and energy futures brokers attributed the gains to a
technical bounce. The settlement of the May crude contract
above $20.30 raises the possibility it could go to $21, said
Shahrokh Nikkhah, senior vice president, futures investments
at Prudential-Bache Securities. But, he added, "I'm still of
the view this is a bear market, and these are bear market
rallies."
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog and pork belly futures
contracts jumped in the wake of a government report that the
nation's hog-breeding herd shrank 4% on March 1 from the
year-earlier date. The report, which was released after the
close of trading Friday, also showed that the number of hogs
being raised for slaughter dropped 2% from March 1, 1989.
Most analysts didn't expect the government to report such a
steep drop in the breeding herd. The quarterly survey
indicates that U.S. hog farmers are continuing to liquidate
their herds. The prices of several hog contracts rose their
maximum daily permissible limit of 1.5 cents a pound and
settled at new life-of-contract highs. The prices of most
pork belly futures contracts rose their maximum daily
permissible limit of two cents a pound. Cattle prices also
rose yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures declined on a rumor that Brazil has been
shipping sugar, an analyst said. The May contract fell 0.60
cent a pound to 15.09 cents. According to Stephen Platt,
analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago, on Friday there
was a report that Brazil wouldn't sell sugar; yesterday it
was rumored that Brazil was shipping sugar, which caused
prices to fall. "Since the Alcohol and Sugar Institute was
disbanded by the new Brazilian administration, there has been
mass confusion as to what developments are taking place with
respect to sugar in that country," he said. "Reports that
Brazil was shipping sugar into the world market couldn't be
confirmed, but they caused selling in futures."
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices rose. The May contract ended
with a gain of 2.15 cents a pound at $2.0110. Cash prices for
the frozen concentrate remain higher than those of futures,
which is attracting demand from processors for futures
contracts, said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch, New
York. In turn, that demand caused traders who had previously
sold short in anticipation of a price decline to buy back
contracts, accelerating the advance, she said. Traders have
already factored current conditions into their thinking and
their focus is now turning to the forthcoming Brazilian
orange crop, Ms. Ganes said. "Anticipation is that the
1990-91 Brazilian orange crop, whose season begins on July 1,
will be smaller than the current one, which amounted to a
record 290 million boxes," she said. "Brazil experienced
ideal weather during the 1989-90 season," she added. A box
weighs 90 pounds.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices advanced. The May contract rose
1.46 cents a pound to 74.16 cents. Buying by computer-guided
funds, local traders and by other speculators absorbed
contracts sold by dealers and merchants, Ernest Simon, cotton
specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, said.
Foreign and domestic demand for cotton is strong, he noted,
and much of the current season's crop has already been
bought. Also, Mr. Simon noted, while the certified exchange
warehouse supplies of cotton for delivery against futures
contracts have declined somewhat from more than 200,000 bales
in late February and remain at a significant 194,000 bales,
there has been a continuous withdrawal of cotton from
exchange warehouses and 32,873 bales are awaiting
decertification. This steady shrinkage of supplies is helping
support prices of related futures contracts as well, he said.
Another analyst said that, as a result, prices for the May
and July contracts have risen to a significant premium over
contracts from October onward. The deferred contract prices
have been under pressure because of a government forecast
last week of increased plantings for the 1990-91 season.
