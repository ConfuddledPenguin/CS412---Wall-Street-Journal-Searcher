   WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Thomas Foley called on
President Bush to take the initiative in this year's effort
to reduce the budget deficit, and warned that difficulties
lie ahead if Mr. Bush doesn't.
   At a breakfast meeting with reporters, the Washington
state Democrat said the president must speak out forthrightly
if there is any hope for a tax increase of the kind that
Democrats believe is necessary for a meaningful budget
package.

   But so far the president has only sidled up to, and has
failed to embrace, the tax-boosting deficit-reduction plan of
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and
Means Committee. A stronger statement of support by the
president is needed if a major deficit-reduction plan can
move ahead, Mr. Foley said.
   "The first action has to be taken by the president," the
speaker said. "First with the president, then with us."
   The House Budget Committee isn't likely to meet its
deadline of April 15 to devise a budget resolution, Mr. Foley
said. Reaching an agreement "is going to be difficult" if the
president continues to stand on the sidelines, he added.
