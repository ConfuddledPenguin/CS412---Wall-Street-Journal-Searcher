   NEW YORK -- Planned Parenthood Federation of America asked
the public to write letters to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. expressing outrage at the company's withdrawal of funding
after pressure from anti-abortion groups.
   In a statement, Planned Parenthood Foundation President
Faye Wattleton called AT&amp;T's decision "a capitulation to
those groups who go to extreme lengths to repress, undermine,
even abolish the free flow of information."

   In addition to the letter-writing campaign, Ms. Wattleton
has urged supporters to donate their AT&amp;T securities to the
foundation so that it will have more voting influence on the
company's policies. She also canceled a $350,000 contract for
an AT&amp;T phone system.
   "We don't see it as AT&amp;T's role to take a position one way
or another on this very personal matter and we won't be
pushed into doing so by an intemperate publicity campaign,"
said an AT&amp;T spokesman.
   AT&amp;T had been one of Planned Parenthood's biggest
corporate sponsors, contributing about $50,000 annually. It
has come under increasing pressure from anti-abortion
activists to withdraw funding from groups that advocate
abortion. A shareholder resolution, calling for such action,
is scheduled for a vote at the company's annual meeting on
April 18.
   AT&amp;T has urged holders to reject the resolution, but it
recently pulled its funds, saying it didn't want to get drawn
into the foundation's battle with anti-abortion groups.
