   ATHENS, Greece -- Greece's consumer price index for
February rose 0.1% from the previous month and 17% from
February 1989, the National Economy Ministry said.
   The ministry attributed February's 0.1% rise mainly to
boosts in drugs and foodstuffs and increases in medical fees
and rents. These were offset by a 4.6% decrease in clothing
and footwear prices because of winter sales.
