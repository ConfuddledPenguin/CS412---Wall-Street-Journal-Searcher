   NEW YORK -- Unlisted share prices slipped in muted trading
yesterday, depressed by weaker equity markets overseas.
   But the spirits of some shareholders were lifted by a bank
takeover in the New York area.

   Home Savings Bank of New York jumped 3 7/8, or more than
25%, to 18 7/8 after agreeing to be acquired by H.F. Ahmanson
for $300 million in stock. Home Savings Bank shareholders
will receive about $25 worth of Ahmanson stock for each of
their shares.
   But investors here awoke to the news that the Nikkei
225-Stock Index plummeted 1,978.4 points, or 6.6%, overnight,
adding to a 3.37% drop in Tokyo's previous session. Stock
prices also fell in European markets.
   "Everything was marked down significantly at the opening
in response to Tokyo and Europe," says George Jennison,
comanager of OTC trading at Wheat First Securities in
Richmond, Va.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index failed to recover from the
early weakness, ending with a loss of 2.36, or 0.54%, to
433.18. Total Nasdaq volume fell to 111.4 million, down 15.2
million shares from 126.6 million shares Friday. The New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index eased 0.41%.
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 662 to 1,321. Meanwhile,
National Market System volume fell to 80,744,400 shares from
Friday's 86,593,000 shares.
   Mr. Jennison says he doesn't expect trading to pick up
until after investors see the string of economic data to be
released this week.
   Scheduled for today are the leading indicators for
February, while on Friday the Labor Department will release
the employment figures for March.
   "I really think that we will have people sitting on the
fence all week," Mr. Jennison says.
   Without increased activity, investors may be reluctant to
buy less-liquid OTC shares, says Jonathan Raclin, senior vice
president of Chicago Corp.
   First Constitution Financial fell 1 3/8 to 6 7/8. The New
Haven thrift holding company said it expects to post a
first-quarter loss after adding $37 million to its loan loss
provision. In addition, its president and chief executive
officer, Walter R. Miller, agreed to resign.
   Brite Voice Systems added 1/8 to 6 3/8. Friday, the
company said it had bought 386,364 of its common shares from
Perry E. Esping, president and chief executive of Business
Records Corp. in Dallas. Brite Voice has about 4.51 million
shares outstanding.
   Digital Sound dropped 1 1/4 to 8 3/4 after estimating that
it earned about 11 cents a share in the first quarter,
compared with 10 cents last quarter and breakeven results for
the first quarter of 1989. The company said it expects sales
in the quarter to have grown about 3% over the fourth quarter
of 1989. Digital Sound went public in late February at $8.50
a share.
   Live Entertainment surged 2 1/2 to 19 1/4. The company
reported today that it earned $1.67 a share in 1989, compared
with net income of $2.15 a share last year. Lisbeth Barron,
vice president of research at S.G. Warburg Securities, says
that when adjusted for non-recurring other income and a
higher number of shares outstanding, the company's operating
net income was up 42% for the year.
   Ms. Barron also notes that Live, a video distributor,
recently bought the video rights to the movie, "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles," which opened to huge crowds this past
weekend. Ms. Barron says that with the 1989 earnings now
released, Wall Street is focusing on Live's 1990 income,
which she estimates will be about $2.50 a share.
   Outlet Communications gained 2 to 21 1/4. The company
earned 49 cents in the fourth quarter, compared with a 37
cent-loss in the year-ago period. The company also said it is
seeking a buyer for a possible merger.
   Eastover dropped 2 to 10. The company reported that its
loss in the fourth quarter widened to 62 cents a share from a
52-cent loss in the quarter last year.
