   NEW YORK -- The dollar rallied again yesterday, the winner
by default as the yen, mark and pound were undercut by
domestic developments.
   The yen was hurt as Tokyo markets put in another
tumultuous performance. Increasingly public German quarrels
over monetary union sapped the mark, and a weekend riot in
London over a new community tax weakened the pound.

   But despite some sharp moves higher during the day, the
U.S. unit finished the global day with only modest advances
against most of its major counterparts. Some dealers said
caution ahead of a meeting scheduled for Saturday of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations took the wind out
of the dollar's sails.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.7009 marks, up from 1.6940 marks late Friday, and at
158.95 yen, up from 158.35 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6348, down from $1.6455 Friday.
   At midmorning in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading at
about 159.03 yen, off from 159.10 yen at the opening and down
from Monday's Tokyo close of 159.95 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.
currency was trading at about 1.7015 marks, up slightly from
the opening quote of 1.7013 marks, and up from Monday's Tokyo
close of 1.6983 marks.
   On Monday in Tokyo, traders said dollar buying by
institutional investors for the new fiscal year and a
newspaper article saying that Japanese insurance companies
are planning heavy sales of their stock holdings pushed the
U.S. unit sharply higher early in the day, before it gave
back some ground on profit-taking and Bank of Japan dollar
sales.
   Early in Tokyo, the dollar shot to 160.30 yen, its
intraday high. Surprised by the speed of the move,
participants began to take profits, dragging the U.S. unit
lower.
   The Bank of Japan joined in with intervention estimated by
traders to have involved $300 million to $500 million.
   Later, in Europe and the U.S., the dollar surged on a
report that the East German central bank opposed the West
German central bank's plan that monetary union involve an
exchange rate of two East German marks for one West German
mark for all but the first 2,000 East German marks in savings
accounts. For those 2,000 East German marks, the rate would
be one-for-one.
   The East German criticism followed a flurry of conflicting
comments by West German politicians on the monetary union.
West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, who had
endorsed the West German central bank's two-for-one plan over
the weekend, told the Bild newspaper in an interview
scheduled to be published Tuesday that politicians will
decide the exchange rate, not the West German central bank.
The comments to Bild appeared to indicate that Mr. Haussmann
was distancing himself from the West German central bank's
plan.
   Sterling fell as soon as trading opened in Asia. Weekend
riots in the United Kingdom over the poll tax that took
effect Sunday in England and Wales have raised questions
about the durability of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The yen is being hurt by the failure of the Bank of Japan
and the Japanese Ministry of Finance to agree on a monetary
policy, and by the massive outflows of capital from Japan to
take advantage of the relatively cheaper prices of real
estate and assets elsewhere, said Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
   The turmoil in Japanese markets was underlined again
yesterday by a plunge of 1,978.38 points in the Nikkei stock
index, to 28,002.07 points.
   Talk of another interest rate increase in Japan, less than
two weeks after the Bank of Japan boosted the discount rate
to 5.25% from 4.25%, was cited as the cause of a sell-off of
the dollar in afternoon trading in New York. The discount
rate is the central bank's base rate on loans to commercial
banks.
   Despite pessimism over the yen, dealers are also wary of
pushing it too low ahead of the meeting scheduled Saturday of
the Group of Seven industrial nations. Although most don't
expect the G-7 to agree on a way to defend the Japanese unit,
they don't want to put too much money on that expectation.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $369.80 an ounce, down 40 cents from
Friday. Estimated volume was a light 1.9 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold opened for trading at $370.55
an ounce.
