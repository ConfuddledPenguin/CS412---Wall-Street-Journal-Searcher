   CHIQUITA BRANDS Inc. said directors doubled the quarterly
dividend on common shares to 10 cents a share and announced
plans for a public stock offering. The Cincinnati company,
with interests in bananas, specialty meats and other foods,
will pay the increased dividend on May 21 to stock of record
May 7. Chiquita said it plans to file a registration
statement covering public sale of 6.1 million common shares,
including 5.2 million shares owned by Great American
Communications Co. and 925,000 shares to be sold by Chiquita.
Both Chiquita and Great American, a broadcasting concern, are
controlled by American Financial Corp., a closely held
financial services company that has major investments in a
number of other companies. The public offering would
eliminate Great American's Chiquita holdings. After the
offering, American Financial and its affiliates will own
65.5% of Chiquita's shares outstanding, down from the current
81.5%.
