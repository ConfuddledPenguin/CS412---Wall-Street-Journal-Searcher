   WASHINGTON -- A survey of the nation's purchasing managers
suggests the economy's manufacturing sector remained sluggish
in March.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by the National
Association of Purchasing Management, rose 0.5 percentage
point last month, to 48.8%. The association says any reading
below 50% indicates a contracting economy in manufacturing,
so the March increase suggests merely that the economy's rate
of decline has slowed.

   The index, which is based on a survey of purchasing
executives in more than 300 companies, is one of the first
measures of economic activity in any month and for that
reason is watched carefully by the financial markets.
   March marks the 11th consecutive month the index has
registered under 50%, but Robert Bretz, the association's
chairman, said that last month showed the smallest rate of
decline since June 1989. He said the associations' members
generally predict a stabilizing manufacturing economy at this
level. It "may be signaling a leveling-off in the 11-month
decline in the economy," said Mr. Brett, who is director of
materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.
   Index estimates display what Mr. Bretz called
"encouraging" increases in production, new orders and new
export orders.
   Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh, said the index indicates "a firming of activity
in the manufacturing sector."
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that
construction spending in February climbed 2.6% to an annual
rate of $436.5 billion, as building increased in all sectors
-- residential, nonresidential and government.
   Many economists attribute the increase in residential
construction spending to the weather. Residential building
grew 1.7% to a $198.5 billion annual rate after rising 3% in
January. Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National
Council of Savings Institutions, said regardless of the rise
he doesn't expect to see a housing boom as long as interest
rates remain where they are.
   "We're seeing small increases in the first quarter that
would be somewhat surprising to see maintained for the course
of the year," Mr. Regalia said. Residential building in 1990
may be a tad better than in 1989, however, he added.
   Nonresidential building climbed 5.5% in March to a $106.4
billion annual rate after surging 6.1% in January.
   After removing the effects of inflation, construction
spending in February was up 2.2%, to a $361.4 billion annual
rate, the department reported.
   Numbers in both reports are adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.
                                                                                                       

   Here are the Commerce Department's figures for
construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally
adjusted annual rates.
