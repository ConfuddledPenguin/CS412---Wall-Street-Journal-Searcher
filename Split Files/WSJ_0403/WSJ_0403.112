agreement with Indalsa, based in Madrid, to open more than
600 am/pm mini markets in Spain and Portugal. Atlantic
Richfield entered into a licensing agreement with Kyodo Oil
of Tokyo in 1988 calling for 500 am/pm mini markets to be
built in Japan. Atlantic Richfield also entered into a
licensing agreement with Wei-Chuan Foods Corp. in Taiwan
