   PITTSBURGH -- Things of beauty aren't always joys forever.
   Ask USX Corp. Apparently forgetting that public relations
is also an art form, the steel and energy giant packed up 64
valuable paintings that had adorned its headquarters and sent
them off to Christie's for auction.

   The move has shocked local art buffs, but the company's
reasoning was simple: A sale, which could reap more than $4
million in today's world of escalating art values, was in the
best interest of shareholders. (One holder in particular,
investor Carl Icahn, is breathing down the company's neck,
demanding that it restructure to get greater stock value.)
   "Shareholders are not well served -- nor am I comfortable
-- having paintings worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on
the walls of executive offices," explains USX Chairman
Charles A. Corry.
   Then hang the paintings in local museums, shout art
aficionados. Get a tax write-off and be a hero instead of a
heel.
   "It's a loss to the city," laments Leon A. Arkus, who put
the collection together when he was director of the Carnegie
Museum of Art. The collection is believed to be the
third-largest in the city, behind only the Carnegie and Frick
museums, and includes noted works of Mary Cassatt, Robert
Motherwell and Childe Hassam.
   Can't the museum go and bid on the pieces themselves?
"Sure we can go to Christie's -- and sit and watch because we
don't have the money," says DeCourcy E. McIntosh, executive
director of the Helen Clay Frick Foundation, which operates
the Frick Art Museum.
   What really galls the local art community is that USX will
make millions while the Carnegie -- which helped put the
collection together for free -- doesn't get a thing. "It's
not fair," pouts a local art expert.
   The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran an editorial: "We can't
imagine that the corporation is so pressed for cash that its
executives couldn't donate" at least part of the collection.
   USX counters that two years ago it donated $1.5 million to
the Carnegie, which includes the natural-history museum as
well as the library. Moreover, many employees have
participated in local fund-raising efforts to assist cultural
institutions.
   And not everyone even liked the paintings. "I didn't see
any executives throwing themselves across the doorway saying
`Please, don't take the paintings away,'" says a USX
spokesman.
