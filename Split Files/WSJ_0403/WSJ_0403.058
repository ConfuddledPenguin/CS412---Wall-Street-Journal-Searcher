   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Oppenheimer Industries Inc. said its
board approved terms of a sale of controlling interest in the
real estate concern to two California entities.
   Under a preliminary agreement, control would be
transferred to a group composed of U.S. Real Estate Advisors
Inc. and Wespac Investors Trust III. The transaction calls
for the sale of 825,000 Oppenheimer shares to Wespac for
$825,000 and for additional shares to be issued to the new
owners after they obtain certain financing, including a $10
million credit line for Oppenheimer.
