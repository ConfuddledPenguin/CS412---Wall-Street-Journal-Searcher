   "Don't be surprised, however, if the 100th Congress soon
finds itself reforming the mess the immigration-reform bill
creates."

   It turns out we were off by two years when we ended an
editorial with those words on November 10, 1986. The 101st
Congress is the one that now gets to clean up the mess
produced by the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration "reform" of 1986.
   A good place to start would be to repeal the bill's
provision for "employer sanctions," which is, we are now
learning, a synonym for harassment. This is the law that
fines employers up to $10,000 and six months in jail for
hiring an "illegal" alien. Last week the General Accounting
Office released a study concluding that the provision had
caused "widespread discrimination" against workers,
especially Hispanics. Rather than play immigrant cop, many
employers avoid the hassle and refuse to hire
Spanish-sounding or -looking Americans. This echoes similar
findings by studies in New York and California.
   In defending the law, Senator Alan Simpson says there may
be discrimination but denies it is "widespread." We'd like to
see him parse that distinction for Hispanics needing a job.
As an arm of Congress, the GAO tends to go easy on the
Members' handiwork, but in this case it couldn't ignore the
facts.
   The GAO surveyed a random sample of 9,491 employers and
estimated that 19% began to discriminate as a result of
Simpson-Mazzoli. About 10% discriminated on the basis of
physical appearance or accent, and another 9% were only
hiring native-born citizens. The GAO extrapolates that
891,000 employers "of the 4.6 million in the population
surveyed reported beginning discriminatory practices because
of the law." Sure sounds "widespread" to us.
   Yet this probably understates any discrimination, since no
one likes to admit to prejudice. Worse, the discrimination
was most pronounced in areas with the largest Hispanic and
Asian populations -- 29% of employers in Los Angeles, for
example. So the law does its worst precisely where racial
comity is most important.
   The law was already notorious for harassing employers. By
last September, the U.S. Immigration Service had assessed $17
million in fines for 3,500 cases of hiring illegals and
36,000 cases of failing to fill out INS paperwork. Alberto
and Estela Fernandez have been fined $18,000 for not filling
out INS forms for their San Antonio maid service. "I feel
like I'm living in a communist country where the government
is constantly looking over my shoulder," Mr. Fernandez told
the Journal's Alfredo Corchado recently.
   Incredibly, in light of this record, Mr. Simpson says he
won't work to repeal the sanctions. Instead, he wants to
impose another layer of watchman government -- specifically,
to "improve our present document system." That means a
national identity card. Mr. Simpson understands the Orwellian
overtones, so he doesn't call it that. But what else to call
a card that would be required before anyone could be hired?
In floating the same idea recently, INS Commissioner Gene
McNary didn't shrink from calling it a national I.D.
   The Social Security card has expressly never been allowed
as an I.D. for civil-liberties reasons. Yet Mr. Simpson wants
to create a new national citizens catalog that bureaucrats
will always find more uses for. Anyone who spoke with an
accent or looked swarthy would be advised to carry this
"passcard" everywhere, just in case the immigrant police
doubted his citizenship. Are we so threatened by Mexican
maids now that we want to tolerate such illiberal means?
   Anyone who visits the 1,990-mile U.S.-Mexican border knows
that blocking illegal immigration is a practical
impossibility. The only real solution is to promote economic
growth in Mexico. One way to do that is to endorse the
Salinas government's brave decision to work toward a
U.S.-Mexican free-trade agreement. Unlike our experiment with
employer sanctions, free trade violates neither human dignity
nor the admirable American spirit of tolerance.
