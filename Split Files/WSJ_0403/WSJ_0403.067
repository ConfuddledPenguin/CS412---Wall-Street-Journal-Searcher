   COLUMBUS JUNCTION, Iowa -- The business of IBP is
business. It carves up meat, it carves out profits. Its
corporate values are not necessarily small-town values.
   Columbus Junction knows that now if it didn't before.

   This heartland town in southeast Iowa has learned a great
deal since August 1985, when IBP Inc., a subsidiary of
Occidental Petroleum Corp., began a major expansion of a
closed-down Rath Packing Co. plant here. Columbus Junction
has learned that giant corporations can treat workers, and
towns, like interchangeable parts.
   "You either do this {welcome new industry} or you die,"
says Maryella Davis, a Main Street dry-goods employee. She
could be speaking for every town desperate for jobs in the
rural Midwest. IBP brought 1,300 jobs, almost one for every
man, woman and child in this town of 1,400. But there is a
trade-off.
   IBP, with a 1989 payroll of $23 million, has saved
Columbus Junction economically -- at the cost of rending
Columbus Junction socially. The intangibles that defined the
heartland town -- stability and continuity -- have begun to
die.
   Since IBP came to town, crime is up 400%, says Police
Chief David Orr. Junior-high and high-school pupil turnover
hit 25% last semester alone, says Principal John Della
Vedova. The police chief suspects there may be 20 or 30
outriders of big-city gangs on Main Street. The plant has
become the tail that wags the dog.
   City Councilman Larry K. Robertson concedes he didn't
anticipate the impact 1,300 people would have: "I just did
not realize how big a monster {the plant} is."
   All this is rooted in IBP's recruiting practices. Not
enough Iowans have been lining up for those 1,300 jobs. And
so IBP recruits, continually and methodically, in the
nation's most desperate pockets of unemployment. From
Brownsville, Texas, (Mexicans and Hispanic-Americans) to
Chicago (inner-city blacks) to Michigan (laid-off auto
workers), wave after wave of IBP new-hires keeps rolling in.
   "These people," towns-folk unconsciously refer to them.
   "Nobody has as good an entry program for people who are
down-and-out," says Eugene D. Leman, IBP's executive vice
president for pork. And undoubtedly, many people would say
that IBP, in giving the jobless jobs and in some cases moving
them out of impoverished central cities, is performing a
laudable public service.
   But the work is hard, and few plants lose so many workers
so quickly. Last year alone, net turnover here approached
100%, according to Mr. Leman. The 3 1/2-year-old plant can
count about 700 workers who have stayed at least a year. The
remaining 600 slots turned over at least twice last year;
most of the newcomers left town. The company predicts
turnover will drop sharply as the plant matures.
   Blue-collar wages at the nonunion plant currently start at
$6 an hour and top out at $10. Despite pay rates that seem
relatively low, the workers last December voted nearly 4 to 1
against joining the Teamsters union. The union lost partly
because company supervisors managed to convince Hispanic
workers that a pro-union vote would mean "no renewal of work
permits" for illegal-alien workers, contends Robert Schorg,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 238. IBP spokesman
Gary Mickelson calls that allegation "absurd" and interprets
the election as "an overwhelming vote of confidence in the
company."
   In any event, "it's hard for anybody with a family to make
a living at IBP, which is a pretty sad commentary," says the
Rev. Stephen Ebel, a Catholic priest.
   The town literally clothes some IBP workers. "We get
people who arrive with only the clothes on their backs," says
Marcy Gerst, an outreach worker for Southeast Iowa Community
Action. Her agency gives them secondhand clothing.
   The town ministerial alliance donates gasoline money.
"When they get here, they have nothing," says the Rev. Thomas
Woodin, the pastor of the United Methodist Churches. The
poorest have no cars. It isn't uncommon to see IBP workers
walking along the highway to and from work.
   The town grapples with social upheaval. Columbus Junction
has long had a Hispanic minority, but the new arrivals bring
new problems. Some schoolchildren can scarcely communicate
without the help of local Hispanics who translate for them.
News stories now run in both English and Spanish in the
Columbus Gazette; a few local residents protested this,
according to News Editor Criss Wilson.
   This town has long since lost the virginal innocence its
late-1830s settlers encountered: a land "smiling in all the
freshness of primeval beauty," one rhapsodized. But with its
church steeples and its 108-year-old library standing high
above the Iowa River, it still hints of an earlier, simpler
Iowa idealized in Grant Wood paintings.
   Into this setting moved the world's largest producer of
fresh pork and beef. Last year, IBP bought $356 million worth
of hogs for the plant, plus $4 million in other area
purchases. It is proud of its safety record and its
state-of-the-art equipment. It also is combative and
controversial.
   Highly efficient and aggressively anti-union, IBP is
driving older Iowa packing plants over the edge. Anti-IBP
activists in Manchester, Iowa, fought off a proposed IBP
packing plant that would have deposited treated waste water
into a residential lake. Last year, IBP Chairman Robert L.
Peterson, in a biting letter to Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad,
suggested that "a lot of Iowans just simply feel that big
business is bad" -- even though IBP had received at least
$7.8 million in state and federal aid since 1983.
   In Columbus Junction, IBP responded to the growing social
pressures, in a way that can only be described as measured.
   Ms. Gerst, the social worker, says she asked the company
to contribute to 1986 Christmas baskets her agency was
distributing to the poor. "Their representatives told me --
how shall I put it? -- they weren't in the business of
charity," she says.
   She tried again in 1987, failed, and didn't try at all in
1988. But in 1989, IBP came through with $500, fresh pork and
Christmas turkeys. Mr. Mickelson, the spokesman, points to
newspaper clippings showing a variety of IBP donations,
including $1,000 to the United Fund and $1,500 to the
Columbus Community Center. Mr. Woodin says the ministerial
alliance has neither requested nor received IBP help.
   In a recent public-relations gesture, IBP flew town
leaders to its Dakota City, Neb., headquarters. There, Police
Chief Orr asked the company to screen new hires more
intensively. It demurred.
   "We ask people to be honest on their resume. Our
interviewers do an interview. We do a physical, and we test
for drugs. I think that should be sufficient," says Executive
Vice President Leman.
   To town leaders such as Thomas Huston, the president of
the Columbus Junction State Bank and the man who led the
effort to bring in IBP, the net benefits far outweigh the
costs. "People forget where we were," he says. "Columbus
Junction was going backward. Now, our supermarket expands.
Our storefronts haven't closed. All of a sudden we get a new
tavern, get a new diner, get a new road." School enrollment
is up, too.
   Meanwhile, the town is working hard to apply its
traditional values to a changed environment. There have been
few serious racial incidents. And the high school,
particularly, has witnessed those little acts of humanity
that show the town at its best.
   Opening day last fall found Armid Benitez, who came here
from Mexico with her mother, sobbing in the parking lot.
"I've never seen a 15-year-old sob so hard," recalls Becky
Furlong, an elementary-school administrative assistant. "She
just did not want to go into that high school." But local
kids put their arms around her and, comforting her, coaxed
her into the frightening new place.
   Overhanging the town is the problem of affordable housing.
Columbus Junction figures it is about 200 units short, and
IBP workers have overflowed into nearby towns. One locally
owned rooming house" -- the barracks," some townspeople call
it -- typically houses dozens of persons. It has only two
bathrooms. "Just the other day, I had a guy come in here and
ask about putting up a tent along the river," says Councilman
Robertson, who indicated he could do so. "I told him there
will probably be more down there in the summer."
   "If workers do decide to do that, it's by choice,"
responds Mr. Mickelson of IBP. "We do our best to find
housing for people. We do put them up at the local motel
until they become established."
   Additional low-cost housing won't be built, city leaders
fear, unless IBP helps out. "Developers ask, `What industry
do you have?' We say, `IBP.' They ask, `What else do you
have?' We say, `IBP,'" City Attorney Jay Schweitzer joked
recently.
   The company, which says it lost some $250,000 last year
renting out mobile homes, seemed ready to take the lead as
late as last summer. Then, it got annoyed by complaints and
negative press. "Immediately, the naysayers came out of the
woods {saying}, `We don't want these people here,'" Mr. Leman
says. "We just decided we're not interested in fighting until
public opinion is more solidified." As John E. Allis, the
plant manager, puts it: "If you kick a dog every day, he
shies away."
   The plant itself, a marvel of efficiency, looks like a
cross between a hospital trauma room and an auto assembly
plant. Slaughtering 11,500 hogs a day, up to six days a week,
it runs on a caste system visible only to the workers
themselves. Kill Floor workers such as "the sticker," who
stands ankle-deep in congealing blood as he stabs open
jugular veins, consider themselves superior -- tougher-than
workers on the Cut Floor, where carcasses are cut apart.
   At the bottom, perhaps, is the rendering crew. They render
down the 40,000 pounds of sour-smelling offal produced by the
plant every hour. When "rendos" walk into Becky's, a local
tavern, everyone slides down to the end of the bar. The
bartender breaks out the scented candles.
   Meatpacking is inherently hard work. Diane Christ, a
former IBP supervisor, says she quit after a series of
battles to make it easier for pregnant women. "I don't
believe women in their first trimester should be lifting
45-pound boxes," she says. "I had a girlfriend on the floor
who had a miscarriage." Mr. Mickelson says IBP will "honor
any restrictions placed on the employee by her physician. And
we welcome that information."
   Despite such complaints, many workers are fiercely loyal
to IBP. "They've been damn good to me," says Paco Orum, a Cut
Floor worker. "They give me overtime. They give me the
opportunity to bust my hump."
   At 42, with his graying mustache and ever-present bandanna
atop his head, Mr. Orum has become a legend, with a
reputation for hard work and for standing by his friends. On
a recent night, the only white worker in the town's new He
Ain't Here Lounge, he drank beer with some of them. He
reflected on the forces and the company that had drawn
workers to this little town from throughout the U.S. and
Mexico.
   Half-jokingly, yet half-solemnly, he said: "We've got a
white guy here by the name of Paco. We've got a black guy by
the name of Kelly. We've got another black by the name of
Shawn. This is Columbus Junction] This is the American
dream."
