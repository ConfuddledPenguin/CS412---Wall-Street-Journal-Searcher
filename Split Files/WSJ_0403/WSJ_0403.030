   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said U.S. firms will
no longer have to apply for export licenses to ship
low-capacity computer hard-disk drives to most non-communist
countries.
   Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said that freeing these products from
unnecessary paperwork would "enable U.S. manufacturers to
compete on an equal footing with foreign competitors who
don't face any exporting constraints." The order will take
effect tomorrow.

   The department's latest move to liberalize technology
trade within the western bloc covers hard-disk drives with a
capacity of up to 45 megabytes of memory. Nearly all personal
computers are equipped with such built-in data-storage
devices. The department estimates that U.S. shipments of
these products were valued at close to $500 million last
year.
   The department decided to ease licensing requirements for
these products after determining that drives of comparable
quality are being widely traded by countries that don't
participate in export controls adopted by the U.S. and its
allies.
   The department said it will continue to require export
licenses for shipment of these products to the Soviet Union
and Eastern European countries, pending changes in export
rules by the U.S. and its allies.
