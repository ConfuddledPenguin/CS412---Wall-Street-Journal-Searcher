   PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny International Inc. said that a
majority of creditors and shareholders have voted in favor of
its reorganization plan to emerge from Chapter 11 protection.
But the consumer products concern said it did not receive the
necessary two-thirds majority in all creditor classes due to
negative votes by Japonica Partners and its affiliates.
   As a result, Allegheny International said it will file a
lawsuit to disallow the votes of Japonica, a New York-based
investment group that has filed its own reorganization plan.

   Japonica Partners said, "There's no basis whatsoever for
excluding the votes of any Allegheny constituent who voted
against management's plan and that any attempt by management
to resuscitate its failed plan in bankrupcty court will not
be successful."
