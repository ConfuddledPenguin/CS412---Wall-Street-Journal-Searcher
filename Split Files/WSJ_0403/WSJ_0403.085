   MIAMI -- General Development Corp., already battered by
financial and legal woes, said it may file for federal
bankruptcy-law protection.
   Negotiations for a badly needed $60 million credit
facility broke down over the weekend, General Development
said, leaving it unable to pay certain obligations. One of
Florida's largest developers, General Development couldn't
meet its more than $10 million property tax bill, due last
Sunday.

   As a result, General Development said it is considering
all options, including a bankruptcy filing. A spokesman
wouldn't characterize the likelihood of such a filing or
discuss the other options under consideration.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
company's stock tumbled $1.875 a share, to close at $4.
   A spokesman for General Development wouldn't say why the
three-week-old negotiations had failed. Other parties
involved in the talks were Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, which holds a $75 million General Development note,
and Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., lead
banks in a $175 million revolving credit facility for General
Development.
   Prudential, Chemical Bank and Manufactuers Hanover hadn't
any comment.
   General Development had hoped to use the fresh cash from
the new credit facility to help reverse liquidity problems
resulting from its recent legal troubles. Last month, the
company pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy in a
plea bargain to settle charges that it defrauded some 10,000
homebuyers by charging inflated prices based on improper
appraisals. Its former two top officers also pleaded guilty
to one count of conspiracy.
   A restitution plan, under which General Development
expects to repay homebuyers as much as $100 million over 25
years, capped a two-year grand jury investigation of the
company. As that investigation unfolded, though, General
Development said its cash flow dried up amid the uncertainty
about its future.
   Meanwhile, United Capital Corp., a New York real estate
company which held about 12.6% of General Development last
month, still plans to try to gain control of General
Development's board. Last month, United Capital made a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, indicating that it
will seek to elect six directors to General Development's
board at the company's annual meeting in May.
   United Capital said it and General Development exchanged
proposals and counterproposals concerning board
representation, management changes and ways United Capital
could help the Miami-based company avoid a bankruptcy-law
filing. But United Capital said the companies couldn't come
to an agreement, and the talks ended.
