   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is being pressed to
end Washington's 15-year-old ban on trade and diplomatic
links with Vietnam. The pressure comes from U.S. firms that
want to do business there and from members of Congress who
think it's time to let old wounds heal.
   But prospects for a quick shift in administration policy
appear slim. Administration officials acknowledge a spate of
inquiries from U.S. companies that want to reopen Vietnam
trade, but the issue remains low on the president's agenda.

   The administration is adamant that ties stay severed until
Hanoi agrees to on-site verification that Vietnamese soldiers
have left Cambodia, and that Vietnam contribute to a
settlement of Cambodia's continuing civil war. Vietnam agreed
to pull its troops out of Cambodia last year after a
decade-long occupation that failed to resolve the fighting
there. The U.S. would like Vietnam to "encourage" the
Vietnam-backed Cambodian premier, Hun Sen, to allow the
United Nations to verify the withdrawal and supervise
transition to an elected Cambodian government.
   "We think Vietnam can contribute to a settlement {in
Cambodia}," says David Lambertson, deputy secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. "If Vietnam does, the
political obstacle to normalization will have been removed."
   Many in Congress don't want to wait. "It's time to get
moving," says Sen. Frank Murkowski, ranking Republican on the
East Asia and Pacific affairs subcommittee, who says the
administration is out of step with changes in Vietnam.
   Similar sentiments for quicker consideration of
normalization were expressed last year in more than 100
government contacts made by businesses, reflecting a desire
on the part of companies such as General Electric Co. and
Boeing Co. to capitalize on what they see as Vietnam's
expanding opportunities. "It's purely exploratory at this
point," says Boeing spokesman James Boynton, "but we think
we'd like to talk to them about selling some airplanes."
   Even before Eastern Europe's communist countries made
history last year, Vietnam had begun dismantling its
centrally planned economy. By last March, price controls were
eased, business subsidies reduced and the currency devalued.
   "They have virtually eliminated central planning," says a
World Bank analyst. "They've gone further than any other
socialist country on price reform -- and did it before
Eastern Europe." Inflation has dropped from about 300% a year
to a more manageable 20% now. International investment is
being promoted.
   "Everyone in the world is trading there but the
Americans," says Doland Stader, the State Department's
Vietnam country officer. "The Japanese are there, the Koreans
are there, the Thais are there. But it's illegal for U.S.
firms."
   The Atlanta-based Cable News Network, a unit of Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., was allowed Jan. 4 to provide
ground receivers that will enable Vietnam to pick up CNN's
satellite signals. But there are no other known exceptions to
the embargo that has blocked trade since the fall of the
U.S.-supported South Vietnamese government in 1975.
   Last fall GE was forced to abandon a deal to provide
engines to a French consortium that intended to ship
airplanes to Vietnam, administration sources say. GE declined
to comment.
   Other U.S. concerns have expressed interest in exploring
oil, construction, tourism and sales opportunities, only to
watch competitors move in. Eastman Kodak Co., which views
Vietnam as a potential retail market, complained in January
to the State Department that Japanese competitors weren't
honoring their own country's sanctions against Vietnam.
   "The reason we did that was our concern, not so much with
U.S. sanctions, but with Japanese companies," says Kodak
spokesman Paul Allen. "The issue not only affects Kodak, but
any U.S. business doing business in Asia."
   The National Association of Manufacturers, representing
13,000 companies that account for 80% of U.S. industrial
output, argues against trade restrictions. While the
organization isn't specifically involved in the Vietnam
issue, trade specialist R.K. Morris sees no reason U.S.
companies shouldn't be allowed to compete.
   "We know this country has been running a trade deficit for
the last decade," Mr. Morris says. "We acknowlege some need
for sanctions, but U.S. export-control policies have to keep
up with reality."
   Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell, a Rhode
Island Democrat, favors faster action. As a first step to
lifting sanctions, he would exchange diplomatic missions.
"Then we would have discussions and play it by ear and see
what happens," he says.
   Sen. Pell's position reflects sentiment on Capitol Hill to
expand debate on Vietnam, especially in light of the failure
of communism in Eastern Europe. Arizona's Republican Sen.
John McCain, a former U.S. Navy pilot who spent five years in
a North Vietnam prison, is among those backing eased
tensions.
   "As with all countries you've had war with, there comes a
time when you have to re-evaluate your policy," he says.
   That re-evaluation could be a long one. Says another
senior State Department analyst: "Notwithstanding {Vietnam's}
economic changes, you clearly don't change a problem in a
matter of months that's been developing over years."
