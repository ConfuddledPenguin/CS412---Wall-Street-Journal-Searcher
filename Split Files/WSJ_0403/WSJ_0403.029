   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Tosco Corp., in a move to reduce
its debt, said that its Seminole Fertilizer Corp. unit signed
a letter of intent to sell its 50% stake in Fort Meade
Chemical Products to U.S. AgriChemicals Corp., a unit of
Sinochem American Holdings Inc.
   A spokesman for Tosco, an independent refining concern,
said terms of the sale weren't disclosed. Sinochem American
Holdings, which is owned by the Chinese government, already
owns 50% of Fort Meade Chemical.
