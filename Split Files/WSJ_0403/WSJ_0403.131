   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. will be paid an initial fee of $1.5
million for aiding Norton Co.'s effort to fend off a hostile
offer by BTR PLC, plus another $5.1 million if BTR drops the
offer.
   Norton, a Worcester, Mass., abrasives and chemical maker,
disclosed the fees in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Morgan Stanley also would receive the
$5.1 million added payment if Norton is acquired by a third
party, if Norton undertakes a recapitalization or if it spins
off assets, among other things, to fend off the bid.

$250,000 on April 19, the filing said. If BTR drops its offer
or if Norton implements an alternative transaction, Lodestar
will receive another $500,000 to $1.5 million, the filing
said.
