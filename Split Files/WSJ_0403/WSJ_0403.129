   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Network Equipment Technologies
Inc. saw its stock tumble 21% following its announcement that
fiscal fourth-quarter results were less than expected.
   The maker of communication networks closed yesterday at
$23.50, down $6.375, in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading
of almost 1.8 million shares. Analysts termed the price
plunge an overreaction.

   The company said its report of net income for the fourth
quarter, ended Saturday, could be less than the $4.6 million,
or 33 cents a share, posted a year earlier. Revenue, it's
estimated, was more than the $38.8 million posted a year
earlier, though lower than the $52 million reported in the
third quarter.
   Network blamed the expected lower results on a
greater-than-anticipated reduction in sales through
International Business Machines Corp., and a failure to
receive confirmation of certain orders at the end of the
quarter.
   Michel Guite, telecommunications analyst at Salomon
Brothers, said recent disappointing earnings in the
technology industry, including unexpected flat results from
Oracle Systems Corp., have caused investors to overreact.
Oracle, a fast-growing software concern, posted a 1.3% rise
in net last week, a sharp contrast to past quarters of
booming growth. That sent the company's stock plunging 31%.
   Mr. Guite has cut his earnings estimate for Network's
fourth quarter to 31 cents a share, from 39 cents, and cut
revenue estimates to $43 million, from $51.7 million. Though
he believes Network remains "sound," he has cut his revenue
estimates for the current year to $210 million, from $230
million because of concern over the declining revenue from
IBM.
   "The company's fundamentals are outstanding," said George
Kelly, analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It's a well-managed
company operating in a strong market."
   Network's stock has been gaining steadily since late 1988,
when it was trading at $18 a share. Recently, it had been
trading as high as $34.375.
   Network sells products that create private networks of
computers and phones. In 1987, the company signed an
agreement with IBM, under which IBM sells certain Network
products world-wide and funds some product development.
