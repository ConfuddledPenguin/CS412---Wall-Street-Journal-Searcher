   WASHINGTON -- The Federal National Mortgage Association
introduced a new mortgage-backed security to increase
below-market mortgage funds designated for low-income buyers
by the Federal Home Loan Banks.
   The financial instrument, called Fannie Mae Affordables,
allows members of the 12 regional Home Loan Banks to pool
special below-market loans originated under two programs
mandated by last year's savings-and-loan rescue legislation.

   The loans are funded with advances from the Home Loan
Banks. Under the Affordable Housing Program, the regional
banks provide subsidized advances to member institutions,
while funds for the Community Investment Program are advanced
at cost. The Affordable Housing Program is expected to total
more than $78 million this year.
   Mortgages originated under the low and moderate income
program can be swapped for Fannie Mae Affordables, which are
single-lender pools as low as $250,000. Institutions can keep
Fannie Mae Affordables as an investment or sell them back to
the regional banks to repay advances. Pools of less than $1
million won't be traded freely on the open market.
   Larry H. Dale, Fannie Mae's senior vice president of
multifamily finance and housing initiatives, said the company
has been working out details of the program with the Home
Loan Banks since the fall. "One of the real beauties of this
approach is that it makes it possible for the Home Loan Banks
and their members to work within an environment they know
well," he said.
   Fannie Mae, a federally chartered, publicly traded
corporation, operates a secondary market for mortgage loans,
buying loans from lenders, packaging them into securities and
selling some to investors while holding others in its
portfolio.
