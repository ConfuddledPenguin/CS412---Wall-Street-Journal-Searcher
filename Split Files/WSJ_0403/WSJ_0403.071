   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it received
a $500 million order to supply power generating equipment to
Enron Power Corp., a unit of Enron Corp., Houston.
   The equipment, to be produced by Westinghouse and its
joint venture partner, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan,
will be used in Britain's $1 billion Teesside Power Project.

   The contract is significant because it provides the
six-month-old Westinghouse-Mitsubishi joint venture a key
foothold in the European market and an opportunity to
demonstrate whether the two companies can work together under
tight deadlines. The plant is scheduled to begin commercial
operation in early 1993.
   Westinghouse said its initial order is for eight
169-megawatt combustion turbine-generators and two
216-megawatt steam turbine-generators. The company also said
it was awarded an exclusive option to supply 10 additional
combustion turbine-generators.
   A Westinghouse spokeswoman declined to break out the
amounts it will receive under each order, but some people in
the industry valued the initial contract at between $200
million and $250 million. Westinghouse, which has been
expanding its North American capacity to meet the revival in
demand for combustion turbines, wouldn't say how much of the
equipment would be produced by Mitsubishi.
   Westinghouse said Britain's Brush Electrical Machines Ltd.
will also provide some of the steam turbines.
   Last year Westinghouse said its orders for power
generation equipment jumped about 20%. Those bookings
amounted to about 2,000 megawatts of generation, according to
Westinghouse's recently released annual report. The
Westinghouse spokeswoman said the company currently has a
backlog of power generation equipment orders of about $1
billion.
   Enron's order roughly equals all of Westinghouse's power
generation equipment orders received last year. Teesside
alone is a 1,725 megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration
power plant, said to be one of the world's largest.
   Enron will design and build the project on the northeast
coast of England. Electricity produced at the plant will be
sold to ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd. and other customers in
the United Kingdom, Westinghouse said. The plant will be
England's first independent power producer.
   Westinghouse also has significant interests in
broadcasting, financial services, over-the-road refrigeration
and electronic systems.
