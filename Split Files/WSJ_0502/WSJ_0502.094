   TORONTO -- Christopher Ondaatje, chairman of Pagurian
Corp. and vice chairman of Hees International Bancorp,
resigned from the boards of both companies.
   A Hees executive said the merchant banking concern, which
is indirectly controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and
Edward Bronfman, is in the early stages of finding
replacements for Mr. Ondaatje on the boards.

   Mr. Ondaatje created Pagurian as a book publishing concern
in 1967 and expanded it into an investment holding company
with interests in Canada and overseas. In December 1988, Mr.
Ondaatje sold control of Pagurian to Hees in exchange for
Hees common shares. He was named Hees vice-chairman at that
time.
   Mr. Ondaatje, 57 years old, said he is stepping down from
the Pagurian and Hees boards because "it is time that I did
something else." He plans to become more actively involved in
publishing in Canada and less so in the financial services
sector.
   He said his principal task since selling control of
Pagurian has been to gradually hand over management of
Pagurian to executives of Hees, Brascan Ltd. and Edper
Enterprises Ltd. Brascan is a resource concern controlled by
the Bronfmans through Edper.
   Mr. Ondaatje said he currently holds five million Pagurian
shares and 1.5 million Hees shares. At last report, Pagurian
had shares outstanding of about 84.9 million, and Hees had
roughly 79.3 million.
   Mr. Ondaatje didn't elaborate on his plans in publishing,
but he said he was "very disappointed" by the sale last
December of the Financial Times of Canada by Southam Inc. to
Thomson Corp. Mr. Ondaatje had expressed an interest in
buying the weekly financial newspaper.
