   SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea had a trade deficit of
US$390 million in April, the fourth consecutive monthly gap
but the smallest since January, though it widened from a $19
million deficit a year earlier, the Trade and Industry
Ministry said.
   Deficits for January, February and March all exceeded $600
million.

   For January through April, the trade balance showed a
deficit of $2.33 billion, compared with a surplus of $39
million a year earlier. The four-month aggregate surpassed
the government's year-end projection of $2 billion in
deficits.
   In April, exports totaled $4.96 billion, up 3.8% from a
year earlier, and imports jumped 12% to $5.36 billion. In the
four months, exports rose only 0.1% to $18.87 billion, and
imports soared 13% to $21.2 billion.
