   WASHINGTON -- Stepping up pressure on Congress to close
military facilities, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney extended a
spending moratorium on base construction and listed 207
additional projects around the world as possible candidates
for cancellation.
   By expanding the range of potential cutbacks, Mr. Cheney
hopes to increase his leverage in a battle with lawmakers
over how deeply and where to cut Pentagon spending. With his
additional targets which include possible closure of some
military bases he hadn't cited previously, Mr. Cheney has now
targeted construction projects with an estimated value of
more than $7 billion.

   The latest proposed "hit list" includes controversial
naval "home ports" slated for Texas, New York and other
states, along with big-ticket items that would mean
substantial jobs and income to dozens of other communities
around the U.S. Some of the projects were authorized by
Congress as long as five years ago, but Mr. Cheney has
ordered them to be re-examined in light of today's budget
pressures and changes in East-West relations.
   At a news conference, Mr. Cheney accused his congressional
critics of "a certain amount of hypocrisy." Some lawmakers
complain loudly about the need for deeper cuts "even as they
plead to save the projects in their own states and
districts," the defense chief asserted.
   When budget cuts threaten to force "dedicated soldiers to
turn in their uniforms and leave the service," he added, "I
cannot put construction projects ahead of people."
   Mr. Cheney's world-wide freeze on signing new military
construction contracts, originally scheduled to end
yesterday, now will remain in effect until June 15. The
secretary previously proposed possible closing of more than
50 bases around the world; Pentagon officials didn't specify
how many more bases could face the same fate in the wake of
his announcement.
   Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood was ordered to
conduct the high-level review of the construction projects
left in limbo. The largest number of projects are in West
Germany; they include construction or upgrading of hangars,
maintenance facilities, housing projects, medical facilities
and schools serving military families.
   Although there are some U.S. facilities among Mr. Cheney's
latest target list, most of the cuts would involve overseas
projects. Targeting overseas bases is certain to provoke less
of a fuss in Congress than going after domestic facilities.
Still, Mr. Cheney's proposals are expected to run into flak
from lawmakers who contend the Pentagon has been unwilling to
seek equally deep cuts in its plans for acquiring
multibillion-dollar new weapons.
