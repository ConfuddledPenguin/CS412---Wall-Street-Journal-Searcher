   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank was
convicted by a federal jury of falsifying statements in
connection with government-backed student loans.
   In early 1988, Florida Federal came under scrutiny for
allegedly filing as many as 17,000 fraudulent insurance
claims on $35 million dollars in student loans. The
investigation helped trigger a management shake-up that
included the resignation of Florida Federal's chairman.

   The federal jury in Tampa found the company guilty of 43
counts of falsifying statements between November 1986 and
July 1987. Sentencing is set for June 27. Florida Federal
faces a possible fine of $21.5 million and restitution of $18
million.
   Two former officers of the company -- Robert O. Harmas, 42
years old, of Noblesville, Ind.; and James J. LaMantia, 59,
of Largo, Fla. -- were also convicted of falsifying
statements. Neither could be reached for comment.
   The thrift's chief executive officer, John W. Sapanski,
said in a prepared statement: "We are disappointed in the
verdict. However, resolution of the student loan problem has
always been the new management's primary objective, so that
we can proceed with implementing a plan to meet {federal}
capital requirements. The conclusion of the trial and the
sentencing will represent significant steps toward resolution
of the problem."
