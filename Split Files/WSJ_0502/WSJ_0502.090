   MagneTek Inc., Los Angeles, said it entered a joint
venture agreement with a Hungarian concern to manufacture
electric motors in Budapest and distribute them throughout
Europe.
   MagneTek, an electrical equipment manufacturer with plants
in West Germany and the U.K., says it will form a 50-50
limited liability corporation with a unit of the major
Hungarian motor manufacturer Evig to make integral motors.

   This segment of Evig's business has revenue of $12 million
a year. MagneTek says the joint venture will raise this to
$16 million in the first year through distribution of the
products in new markets. Most of Evig's motors have been sold
domestically.
   A MagneTek spokesman wouldn't specify the company's
initial investment in the joint venture.
