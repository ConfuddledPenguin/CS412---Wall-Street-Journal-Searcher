   NEW YORK -- Interest rates rose again at Citicorp's weekly
auction of commercial paper, in part reflecting concern by
debt-ratings agencies about the banking company's credit
quality and capital adequacy.
   The average rate rose to 8.451% at Citicorp's $50 million
weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs,
from 8.3725% at last week's sale. Last week's rate had risen
nearly 15 basis points in the wake of an announcement from
Moody's Investors Service Inc. that it was considering
lowering its debt ratings of Citicorp.

   Late last week, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its senior
debt ratings for Citicorp, although commercial paper was
affirmed at single-A-1 plus.
   At the latest auction, bids totaling $405 million were
submitted for the 91-day paper. Accepted bids ranged from
8.448% to 8.454%.
   Citicorp also said that the average rate rose to 8.49% at
its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from
8.395% at last week's sale.
   Bids totaling $390 million were submitted. Accepted bids
ranged from 8.485% to 8.495%.
   The bank holding company will auction another $50 million
in each maturity next Tuesday.
