   PISCATAWAY, N.J. -- Florence Jordan sits, bewildered, as
her three children talk about how her Alzheimer's disease has
made a hell of their lives.
   Chris, the middle child and a recent college graduate,
moved back in with her 54-year-old mother in Old Bridge,
N.J., after seeing her pull a flaming dishrag from the oven,
drop it onto the living-room rug and leave it there to burn.

   "You find yourself thinking about {Alzheimer's} every
hour," says Jimmy, 22, who is still in college. "It takes
over your mind."
   Alzheimer's disease insidiously corrodes its victims'
brains. Over a period of years, it progressively destroys
their memories, their ability to reason and their hold on
reality. Before it kills them, it robs them of speech and
makes them incontinent. Some four million Americans are
afflicted; about that many people are said to suffer other
forms of dementia.
   As the illness progresses, most victims cease to grasp
fully what is happening to them. And that, mercifully,
tempers their suffering. But it doesn't temper the suffering
of the relatives and friends who feed, bathe and nurse them,
who watch over them day and night, and who mourn their slow
deaths. The families often suffer more than the victims do.
   In Piscataway, the state-financed Copsa Institute for
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders is bringing relief
both to dementia victims and to the husbands, wives and
children who care for them. For the patients, it offers a
day-hospital program that allows them to socialize, exercise,
play games and practice simple mental tasks. It has a
diagnostic clinic and, for relatives, it provides counseling,
information and a desperately needed six-hour reprieve --
several times a week -- from exhaustion and despair.
   A look at the Copsa Institute's experience shows a way of
life that may well await tens of millions of Americans.
   ---
   At 9:45 one Friday morning, about a dozen patients troop
into a room and take their places at an oblong table. (The
institute requested that only first names of most patients be
used in this story.) A majority of them meet clinical
criteria for "probable Alzheimer's disease," officials say,
while the rest suffer dementias from vascular or other
causes. A definite diagnosis of Alzheimer's, a degenerative
illness of the brain and nervous system with no known cause
or cure, is made only in a post-mortem examination of brain
tissue.
   Today, participants have spent half an hour outside in the
lobby getting reacquainted, exchanging pictures of themselves
and pinning on name tags. Decorative paper snowflakes dangle
from the ceiling.
   Staff nurse Sandy Egan opens the daily orientation period
with questions about time and place. "What day is this?" she
asks. "Friday," several voices pipe up. "Good]" Ms. Egan
writes the word "Friday" in large letters on a board. On a
calendar, she crosses out yesterday's date. "What day of the
month is today?" she asks. This time, there is a pause, and
only two or three hesitant replies.
   After questions about famous movie actors, patients'
birthdays, this and that, the group moves to a smaller room
to have their thought-processes jogged. They are shown
colorful pictures of improbable scenes -- a worker drilling a
hole in a library floor, a man walking upside down on a
ceiling, an outsize telephone plunked onto a small table.
   "What do you think of this one?" asks Lisa Berbig, the
program's coordinator.
   "It's a good picture," a man named Bill replies.
   Esther says: "I think the little girl is going to the
library, and he is doing some drilling."
   Nobody mentions the giant phone.
   The group has better luck with aphorisms. Asked to
complete the phrase, "Absence makes the . . .", several
voices cry out happily, ". . . heart grow fonder."
   Next comes a 15-minute walk, followed by group
psychotherapy. Pauline describes her favorite photo, in which
she is sitting in her grandmother's lap. Rinalda remembers
how she used to crack the whip with her own daughter and
seven -- or was it eight? -- sons. "I'd call their names in
Italian," she says, her face crinkling into a grin. "They'd
say, `C'mon, let's get outta here. Mom's mad.'"
   Lunch is chicken soup, rolls, manicotti and green beans,
with peaches for dessert. To avoid confusion, patients each
get just one utensil to eat with. Some patients sing along to
tapes of old favorite songs.
   After a rest period, health specialist Florence Meyers,
the mother of seven and the widow of an Alzheimer's victim,
leads an exercise period. Next comes dance time, and Ana, who
has seemed quite reserved, seizes two bright scarves provided
for the occasion and sashays about, swiveling her hips. Bill
asks Ms. Egan, the staff nurse, to dance.

   The Copsa Institute's day-hospital program was the first
in New Jersey when it opened in 1982, and it has been a model
and training ground for many of the 32 such facilities that
have since sprung up in the state. While day-care facilities
remain relatively rare in the U.S., people in the field
predict they will be commonplace in the next century as the
ranks of the elderly swell, to 68 million people over 65 in
the year 2040, from 30 million now.
   As this session comes to a close, the blinds are drawn to
prevent pandemonium at the sight of arriving relatives. Ms.
Berbig leads the group in imitating chickens -- pressing
hands to nose to form a beak, flapping elbows like wings and
squawking. There's more singing and dancing, then "wrap-up"
time, a review of the day's activities.
   As people pick up the patients for the night, Florence
Jordan -- the woman who lives with her 23-year-old daughter
Chris -- struggles to get into her coat. Though her left arm
is in one sleeve and Ms. Berbig is holding the other for her,
she gropes around the back of her neck, searching in vain for
the opening. After several seconds, Ms. Berbig guides her
hand.
   ---
   One of the biggest blows to Florence's son and daughters,
they say, has been the abandonment of the family by some of
their close relatives. Once, desperate for assistance, "we
went begging" to them for a few hours of their time, says
Florence's 26-year-old daughter Kathy Ciacciarelli, "but they
didn't want to get involved." She, like her brother and
sister, is active in her mother's care.
   There have been some pleasant surprises, too. Florence
Jordan's former husband, now remarried, helps out with money.
The Jordans' children are closer to one another now because
of their 54-year-old mother's situation. And while they no
longer can have sensible conversations with her, they try to
make sure she enjoys herself. She likes going to movies,
taking walks and eating Chinese food.
   As a guest is about to leave Mrs. Jordan's apartment,
Jimmy, a thick-chested former football player, walks over to
his mother and gives her a squeeze. "Hey, Ma, how you
feeling?" he asks, grinning. She beams.
   ---
   Florence Jordan's own parents are still living. After
spending a day at their apartment in a high-rise for the
elderly in Sayreville, she is eager to go home. Once she has
left, her father, 84-year-old Joe Colombo, shakes his head.
"As soon as she got here this morning, she wanted to leave,"
he says.
   Mr. Colombo used to take his daughter for walks, but he
recently had heart surgery and he has arthritis. When he and
his 86-year-old wife, Vera, discuss their daughter, one
question keeps coming up: Why? "Sometimes I ask God why he
did this," Mr. Colombo says, adding quickly that he doesn't
blame God. Vera rejects any suggestion that the disease was
inherited. Joe seems to disagree: "It could be a little gene
that snuck in," he says.
   Mrs. Colombo brightens when she remembers Florence as a
little girl. "She had eyelashes that turned way up," she
says. "She was always running."

   It is late afternoon, and Jule Sloane, a jaunty
grandmother in plaid slacks, heavy silver earrings and
wire-rimmed glasses, pours glasses of chilled white wine for
herself and a guest at her home in Summit.
   As her 72-year-old husband, John, a grandson of Thomas
Edison, mutters on a couch nearby, she speaks about the happy
years of her marriage. Mr. Sloane, a Yale graduate, went to
war after they were married in 1942. When he returned from
his service in England, Italy and North Africa, he took a job
as a writer for a house organ at Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
translating scientific jargon "into plain English," she says.
   "He was a quiet guy," she says. "He never looked rushed.
But everything always got done. He was very funny in a dry
way, always punning."
   She talks about her husband's deteriorating mental state
and the loss of his personality. His condition has been
described as "senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type," but
Mrs. Sloane believes his illness has been complicated by
strokes. He began to show signs of disorientation in the
early 1980s, forgetting what errands had brought him to town,
for example. Recently, she has had to withdraw him from a
day-care program because his behavior was becoming
disruptive; he was always trying to leave the place.
   Mrs. Sloane observes: "I don't say, `Why me?' I say, `Why
him?'" He peers at his wife, frowning, searching for words.
He is a handsome man -- tall, slim, and nattily dressed in a
plaid shirt and blue suspenders. His wife goes to him, gives
him a hug. "It's OK, honey, now you just don't be upset," she
says, and kisses his cheek.

   At a spouse-support group meeting at the Piscataway
center, a dozen men and women ranging in age from mid-50s to
late 70s sit in a circle and talk about their anguish.
   Once, they had dreamed of retirement as a reward for lives
of hard work. Now, instead of traveling and spending time
with friends, they stay at home and feed and dress their
husbands and wives. The fatigue is evident in their faces.
The ailments of old age plague them. They are angry at what
they see as government favoritism for the poor over the
middle class; they feel Alzheimer's disease, the nation's No.
4 killer (after heart disease, cancer and stroke) gets short
shrift from the media. They wonder if they will ever enjoy
life again.
   One husband gets nods of understanding when he says he has
fantasies about asphyxiating himself and his wife by "going
into the garage and turning on the key" to the ignition of
his car. A wife says she has devised "three ways" to kill
herself.
   A man named Gus says, "I'm at the end of my rope." His
wife is 60 years old but is "going back to her childhood,
when she was seven or eight," he says. "Sometimes, she gets
violent." Roger says his wife can get "kinda tough." He goes
on: "She might strike me, or throw water." Tears well up.
Though seated, he is panting, nearly out of breath. "I get a
little emotional," he says. "I myself have emphysema. So it's
extremely difficult."
   Other participants murmur their support. Here, people have
empathy.
   They also offer practical, tough-minded advice. There is a
lively discussion about the best locks to use for foiling
Alzheimer's patients' midnight wanderlust. Larry Benjamin,
who was an advertising-makeup man for the New York Times
Magazine before he retired, has been caring for his wife for
about 15 years. He continues to feed her twice a day, though
she has been in a nursing home since 1988. Mr. Benjamin, who
is 74, gently urges younger participants in the group not to
get their hopes up about the possibilities of new drugs, and
not to look askance at restraining devices for agitated
dementia victims. "Restraint isn't cruel," he says. "It's
{just} a bit of netting. You have to modify your thinking on
this."
   Several participants chastise Gus for letting his wife get
him into arguments he can't win. Gus says he keeps telling
her she will never find things she has "lost" because they
don't exist.
   "You're already in trouble," scolds Milton. "You can never
win by reasoning with an Alzheimer's patient." Several people
urge Gus to bring his wife to the Piscataway day-care center,
and they suggest ways of overcoming her resistance to the
idea. One says he tricked his wife into such a move by
telling her they were going to church. By the time they
arrived, she had forgotten the purpose of the trip.
   Everyone laughs. The horror stories have their comic side.
The laughter is easy because families see their own
experience in the stories others tell. They laugh when Ana,
who married her husband 11 years ago, in late middle age,
describes how he poured Coke into a jar of grated cheese and
started drinking it. They laugh when Gus says he has read all
the handbooks on coping with Alzheimer's patients but,
unfortunately, "the books say one thing, and my wife does
another."

   Legal-services attorney Janice Chapin tells a crowded room
of dementia victims' families how to cope with Medicaid rules
that can gobble up all of one's savings in return for a place
in a nursing home. One recommendation: Set up a big burial
account free from the state's grasp, bequeath the unused
portion to yourself or your children, and order a cheap
funeral when the time comes.
   No, she tells a gnarled old man, the eligibility
information he got from a Medicaid office was wrong. A
bureaucrat's mistake might have cost him thousands of
dollars.
   The questions at the lecture organized by the Copsa
Institute go into the nuts and bolts of nursing-home
placement and reimbursement. Standing chalk in hand next to a
blackboard, Ms. Chapin explains that the assets, but not the
earnings, of a healthy spouse can disqualify a patient from
Medicaid. But, she says, some assets, like a home in which
the healthy spouse is living, can't be touched.
   "So what am I going to do?" asks one exasperated member of
the audience. "Bury the money in the cellar?"
   Ms. Chapin replies: "Basically, you've got to spend it
all." Instead of putting it in the bank, she suggests, why
not "buy a new roof for your house?"

   William E. Reichman, the youthful, bearded medical
director of the Copsa Institute, sits at his cluttered desk
and talks about Alzheimer's. Dr. Reichman describes it as a
"familial disorder." As a researcher, he seeks more-effective
drugs to treat the disease, especially the hallucinations and
psychotic behavior relatives find even more upsetting than
the memory loss. (Sample: the impostor syndrome, in which a
spouse becomes a feared intruder.) As a psychiatrist, Dr.
Reichman tries to guide families "through a grieving process"
as Alzheimer's eats away at a loved one's very identity.
   The day center, he says, gives participants "their peer
relationships back." The elaborate structure of the
activities is crucial; long after Alzheimer's patients have
lost reasoning power, they still seem to know how to act in
familiar situations.
   Most Friday afternoons, Dr. Reichman examines dementia
victims in nursing homes where few other psychiatrists
venture. Consultations are difficult, and the state is stingy
about paying doctors.
   "As soon as I show my face in a nursing home to see Mrs.
X, the nurses start grabbing me, begging me to look at
patients Y and Z," Dr. Reichman says.
   He tries to maintain a physician's professional detachment
from the suffering he sees, but it isn't always possible.
"Some families are remarkably powerful at pulling you in," he
says. In California, where he got his early training at
UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute, the teen-age son of an
Alzheimer's patient interviewed him for a school report. Dr.
Reichman got a copy of the essay in the mail as a gift, and
he keeps it in his office. He reads excerpts:
   "My father was a very bright man. He worked on developing
the space shuttle. . . . What was once a sweet, kind, caring
personality is now almost completely gone. . . . There isn't
a moment of any day that he isn't on my mind. . . . From
writing this paper, I also learned to deal with my own
feelings. . . . I thought I was going to have a nervous
breakdown."

   In a nursing home a few miles' drive from Piscataway, Mary
lies sedated and stretched out on a special restraining
"geri-chair" in her room, a towel wrapped around a swollen
left leg. Mary, who is about 80, suffers from Alzheimer's and
from an injury to her head sustained in a car accident. She
habitually becomes agitated at about this time -- 5:30 in the
afternoon -- but today she is still asleep. A nurse's aide
bends over her, shouting, "Mary, wake up, the doctor's here."
Mary stirs. "Oh, God," she moans.
   This is Alzheimer's in its last, worst stages. Typically,
the disease strikes people in their 70s and 80s -- though the
middle-aged aren't immune -- and it results in death, often
from pneumonia or other infections, five to 20 years after
its onset.
   Dr. Reichman examines Mary. He asks her to look at him,
then loudly repeats the request. She stares vacantly. A
nurse, Merlene, smoothes Mary's hair and gives her a hug.
"How are you today, honey?" she coos.
   Leaving the room, the doctor explains that the trick is to
hit the "exact balance" of all the drugs Mary is taking.
Then, she would be able to sleep well yet stay composed in
her waking hours. But administering proper dosages is tricky:
Sloppy record-keeping, often by poorly trained or
overburdened nurses with little or no guidance from
psychiatrists, is a big problem in nursing homes.
   In a tiny alcove, Dr. Reichman pores over log books and
barks questions at nervous personnel about patients'
reactions to medications.

   There are some slivers of light in the Alzheimer's
nightmare.
   There is Florence Meyers. Nursing her husband in the late
1970s and early '80s while raising seven children was so
physically strenuous, she says, that when she finally checked
her husband into a clinic and got a few days' respite, "it
hit me like a truck. My entire body ached from all that
release." Today, as a health specialist at the Piscataway
facility, she lights up the faces of the patients with her
joshing, her hugs and an occasional tickle.
   There is Tom Johnson, Copsa's clinical coordinator, whose
uncle and aunt had Alzheimer's and who acknowledges that he
is "obsessed" about his own prospects of getting the disease.
Many of the sons and daughters of patients, he says, wonder
if they are condemned by their genes to their parents' fate.
Researchers say only about one in six patients suffer the
variety of Alzheimer's that runs in families. Mr. Johnson
feels that counseling gives people hope. "I see that life
goes on, the world doesn't cave in," he says. "In the
narcissism of being well, we say, `Oh, God, I'd kill myself.'
But in the thick of the disease, people cope. They suffer --
but they cope." What strikes him is the stubborn love
families show victims even in the final stages of Alzheimer's
disease.
   There is Carmine Cascella, a retired factory
production-department superintendent who does volunteer work
at the institute two afternoons a week for the satisfaction
of thinking "maybe I've made {patients} a little happier." He
says that "after a while, they sort of recognize you. You
dance with them. You sing with them." Before he came to Copsa
2 1/2 years ago, he had no idea what Alzheimer's was. Giving
a helping hand, he says, "is like I'm giving something back"
to society.
   There is Mildred Potenza, who organized a grass-roots
organization in the late 1970s to lobby the state to set up
the Copsa program. Her duties as the institute's
resource-center coordinator include fielding questions from
all over New Jersey on an 800 line. She often talks to
worried relatives "for half an hour or more. Even if I can't
offer anything concrete, they feel much better."
   Finally, there are all the exhausted husbands, wives and
children whose love shines through. The wife of a former
schoolteacher, married to him for nearly 60 years, and
herself once a professional musician, struggles to remember
how many children she has. Finally, she stammers, "Three, no
two boys . . . and a girl." He gently corrects her: "No,
honey, it's two girls and a boy. You're doing just fine."
