   Ferranti International PLC will take "very substantial"
write-offs this year, said Chairman Eugene Anderson.
   He said at the company's extraordinary general meeting in
London that the majority of the write-offs will have "no
immediate cash-flow implications but will, when combined with
the extraordinary gains which have been achieved in recent
sales of assets, more accurately reflect company assets and
liabilities."

and defense equipment maker last year wrote off about #185
million ($303.5 million) and arranged special, short-term
credit facilities with its bankers.
