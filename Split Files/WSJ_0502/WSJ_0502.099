   CHICAGO -- A former day-care center operator pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court here to defrauding
telecommunications companies out of nearly $600,000 as the
head of a nationwide computer-hacking ring.
   Leslie Lynne Doucette, 36 years old, working with 152
alleged co-schemers, fraudulently obtained 481 telephone
credit-card codes, according to the plea agreement, and then
published them in voice-mail systems that were accessed by
other hackers. The scheme was discovered when a suburban
Chicago real-estate brokerage complained that its voice-mail
system had been invaded by the hackers, who had changed the
system's passwords.

   Federal prosecutors charged Ms. Doucette last year in the
scheme, which according to the indictment resulted in a loss
of $1.6 million of telephone and computer services from the
communications concerns, including American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., ITT Corp., and Western Union Corp.
   The one count to which Ms. Doucette eventually pleaded
guilty carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison, and
a $1 million fine.
