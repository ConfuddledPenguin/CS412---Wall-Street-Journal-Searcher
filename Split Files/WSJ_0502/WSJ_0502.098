   WASHINGTON -- The manufacturing sector of the economy
showed signs of expanding in April for the first time in 11
months, according to a survey of purchasing managers across
the country.
   An index compiled by the National Association of
Purchasing Management rose to 50.2% last month from 48.8% in
March. The association says a reading above 50% signals the
manufacturing economy is generally growing. Every monthly
reading since May 1989 has been below that threshold.

   Though the index is based simply on survey responses from
purchasing executives in about 300 companies, the financial
markets watch it closely because it is usually the first
measure of economic activity for any month.
   The Commerce Department also said that spending on
construction projects fell 1.4% in March, the first decline
this year and the biggest drop since February 1989.
   The decline followed hefty rises of 3.2% in February and
2.4% in January. The weather was unseasonably warm in those
months, leading many builders to step up work on projects.
March weather, on the other hand, was normal for the month.
   Both manufacturing and construction have been hurt by the
Federal Reserve's efforts to slow the economy and battle
inflation by maintaining high interest rates.
   But according to the purchasing managers surveyed in
April, production and new domestic and export orders all
increased during the month. However, they said, employment
continued to decline, suggesting that softness persists in a
number of industries.
   "The manufacturing economy inched into expansion territory
as it entered the second quarter," said the association's
chairman, Robert J. Bretz, director of materials management
at Pitney Bowes Inc.
   Many economists think manufacturing is beginning to
scramble out of its slump of the past year, though they
believe it will continue to be weak for some time. On Monday
Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, told a
convention of the purchasing managers association in New
Orleans that "risks of a sharp or prolonged decline in
manufacturing output clearly have abated since last autumn."
   But the government has issued some disturbing figures on
inflation recently. And in the purchasing managers survey,
for the first time since May 1989 more purchasing executives
said their prices were higher than lower. As a result of
inflation worries, some analysts speculate the Fed will
consider pushing up interest rates in the near future. In any
case, it's highly doubtful that interest rates will fall any
time soon, and that will likely prevent a hearty rebound in
manufacturing.
   Despite the overall decline in construction spending,
outlays for private residential construction, the largest
part of the building market, grew 1.8% to a $203.2 billion
annual rate in March. That followed a 1.5% increase in
February.
   Spending on industrial, business and other private
nonresidential construction tumbled 4.7% in March, to $101.1
billion rate, after posting a 5.8% gain in February. Outlays
for public construction projects dropped 4.8%, to a $90.7
billion rate, after rising 5% in February.
   Overall construction spending in March ran at a $432.5
billion rate, down from a $438.6 billion rate in February.
   Both reports are adjusted for seasonal variations.
