   Doctors at a big teaching hospital made mistakes in three
of every 1,000 drug prescriptions they wrote. Half the
mistakes could have caused problems, including fatal
reactions, for patients, a team of hospital pharmacists said.
   The pharmacists, from the Albany (N.Y.) Medical Center
Hospital, said they routinely double-check doctors'
prescriptions against patients' computerized medical records.
They caught mistakes in 905 of more than 289,000
prescriptions written by the hospital's staff and attending
physicians in 1987, Timothy S. Lesar and his pharmacy
colleagues reported in this week's issue of the Journal of
the American Medical Association.

   The errors in 522 of the prescriptions could have caused
problems for patients, ranging from life-threatening
reactions to bothersome side effects, had the prescribed
drugs been used as directed, the pharmacists said.
   In the most common serious mistake -- 61 cases -- doctors
prescribed a drug to which the patient was allergic. Other
errors included ordering antibiotics for serious infections
for the wrong patient, ordering overdoses of drugs including
"blood thinners" to prevent blood clots, underdoses of a drug
to combat lead poisoning, and mixing up names of drugs --
such as prescribing azathioprine (an immune suppressant that
prevents rejection of transplanted organs) instead of
azidothymidine, or AZT, used to bolster the immune system of
AIDS patients. (AZT's generic name is now zidovudine.)
   Most of the prescriptions were written by doctors on the
hospital staff, with first-year residents having the highest
error rate -- four erroneous prescriptions per 1,000 written.
Doctors in private practice wrote only a small portion of the
prescriptions but had the second highest error rate, almost
3.5 per 1,000 prescriptions.
