   BUDAPEST -- Although the first freely elected parliament
in 43 years convenes here today, there seems to be little
enthusiasm for this long-awaited moment. Perhaps spirits were
deflated by the strains of the election campaign. Members of
the winning Hungarian Democratic Forum and of the runner-up
Alliance of Free Democrats exchanged accusations that the
other party was not completely free of the stain of
communism. The HDF was equated with "laces and ribbons"
patriotism, while less-than-artful allusions were made to the
concentration of Jewish intellectuals among the Free
Democrats.
   Since the election, Jozsef Antall, the
prime-minister-in-waiting, has promised to put "the
resentments and affronts accumulated during the campaign
behind us." The Free Democrats too are calling for
"constructive cooperation."

   With seating arrangements ironed out (the ex-communist
"Socialists" refused the seats offered them on the far left
wing of the parliamentary chamber), the new parliament can
get down to real business: setting up the standing and
special committees; voting themselves respectable salaries;
and holding hearings on the new cabinet, which should be
presented in a few days.
   The main procedural issue will be to decide which laws
will need a two-thirds majority-which the governing coalition
of the HDF, the agrarian Smallholders and the Christian
Democrats do not have. All parties agree in principle that
laws of constitutional significance -- such as the laws
expected on the decentralization of government, the
declaration of states of emergency and the ordering of closed
sessions of parliament -- should require the assent of
two-thirds of the elected deputies.
   It makes less sense, however, for laws on tax regulations
to continue to require such a margin. The governing parties
may well decide to cede some key parliamentary posts to the
opposition in return for a curtailing of the two-thirds rule.
The dilemma is that if law making procedures become too
restrictive and inflexible, economic restructuring could get
bogged down; if, though, the coalition gains an unrestrained
hand over legislation, a suspicion of statism may continue to
linger over the country.
   Among the more complex issues is agrarian land reform,
which was thrust into the fore by the Smallholders, who
gained prominence in the closing weeks of the campaign by
proposing to restore the 1947 farmland ownership status. The
Smallholders' Ferenc Nagy says that his party will insist on
the return of the land or on appropriate compensation if the
former owner no longer wants to work the property. He
concedes that because of a shortage of funds a moratorium on
the payments may be necessary at the outset. Mr. Nagy, an
agricultural engineer whose once prosperous family was
pauperized by the communists and whom local party bosses
hounded from his job as president of a collective in
Kisharsany near the Yugoslav border, says that "the
constitutionality of the nation" cannot be established
without "clarifying these property rights."
   Mr. Antall agrees in priniciple, noting that it was the
peasantry which "has suffered the most." But he sees
complications stemming from postwar population transfers,
voluntary property sales and value changes due to land
development. A compromise such as "long-term reparations"
might be necessary for those who moved away, while people who
never owned land but worked in a collective farm all these
years "would have to be given a preference to buy."
   The Free Democrats dislike both approaches. Ferenc Koszeg,
who edits a political weekly that has emerged from its
formerly underground status and who is a new member of
parliament, sees no reason to grant ownership to anyone --
former owner or long-time employee. "Everyone suffered -- not
only 20% of the population," he says. "The suggestion that
rent is now due to the descendant of a former owner would be
a liability for everyone in the country -- in the form of
higher prices." Mr. Koszeg says farmland should be privatized
the way apartment buildings, manufacturing facilities and
hotels should beby ending subsidies and allowing markets to
develop so prospective buyers can make bids.
   Whether such radically different approaches can be merged
into something coherent is crucial not only to Hungary's
future, but could serve as a guide for other Eastern European
states and to certain areas of the Soviet Union itself.
Export capability will become increasingly important as the
food-for-fuel bartering cartel of Comecon disintegrates. In
Hungary, 70% of the land is suitable for some agricultural
activity, while 50% is arable -- well above the world average
of about 10%. That is why, Mr. Nagy says, the communist
conceit about heavy industry was particularly disastrous for
Hungary.
   Foreign policy is another area about which the Hungarian
parties don't see eye-to-eye. A statement announcing an
intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact is recommended by
the Free Democrats. "Hungary should initiate talks
independent of other Warsaw Pact members," Mr. Koszeg says.
The HDF's official position is for more restraint and
coordination with other Warsaw Pact members. The HDF thinks
that the pact is not so menacing any more and may even offer
protection from potentially hostile neighbors such as
Romania.
   Mr. Antall is not eager to provoke Mikhail Gorbachev, but
he says that HDF "supports Lithuania fully," and finds
nothing objectionable about German unification within the
framework of "European political and economic integration. We
don't see a conflict between that and the Atlantic idea. We
support American presence -- military presence -- in Europe."
   Mr. Antall, a historian, feels that "Britain, the U.S. and
in part France, because of their overseas interests in the
past decades and past century, neglected this continent. In
the past century this was understandable in the era of
colonization. But in the 20th century they should have
recognized that the real nerve center of the world is middle
Europe, where global scale power questions are decided
without fail. They allowed Middle Europe to slip under
Hitlerism, and from Hitlerism directly into Stalinism." Mr.
Antall hopes that the circle now can be broken once and for
all.
