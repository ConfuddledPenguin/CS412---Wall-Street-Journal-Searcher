   Alexander Cockburn's March 22 Viewpoint, "Cabbage-and-Kiwi
School of Journalism Tackles the East Bloc," reveals the
hypocrisy of the prototypical left-leaning journalist. He is
scrambling to salvage some respect for Eastern Europe's
crumbling dictatorship of the proletariat.
   He takes issue with a Washington Post dispatch from East
Berlin by Glenn Frankel. He notes that 71% of East Berlin
voters picked left-wing candidates. He follows with a
declaration that the Christian Democratic Party
(moderate-to-right leaning) seems to receive its support in
the countryside. Obviously, Mr. Cockburn will go to any
length (and sink to any depth) to support faltering left-wing
causes.

   Why did East Berliners lean left in their selection of
political candidates? You need only to look inside our own
Capital's Beltway for the answer. Many East Berliners, like
their Washington counterparts, are entrenched bureaucrats
whose very existence is threatened by a free-market,
capital-driven society. Their political views do not remotely
reflect the position of people in the "countryside."
   The political pulse of the East German countryside, like
our own Midwest and South, is always ignored by journalists
like Mr. Cockburn. By the way, sophisticated and hard-working
citizens of Leipzig and Dresden voted overwhelmingly for
Centrists and right-leaning candidates. The Christian
Democratic Party was supported by more East Germans than
those voting for the next three largest parties.

   Mr. Cockburn has amazed me by writing sensibly for once
(some of the article, anyway). Yes, journalists who stick
close to their hotels get a lopsided view, and the East
German Communists' 17% was heavily concentrated in East
Berlin, which seems rather natural, since that's where loyal,
ambitious Communists got promoted to. (Conservatives always
do better in the boondocks.) And empty food stores don't
necessarily mean that people are starving.
   But what of those disgracefully high-priced oranges and
kiwi fruit? Any commissar with a slide rule could demonstrate
easily that cabbages contain far more Vitamin C and calories
per mark. Still, nobody is forcing those East Berliners to
buy. "Sell it or smell it]" is the capitalist rule for
fruitmongers, and once the novelty value is over, the fruit
lady will have to cut the price, toss the oranges in the
garbage or eat them herself.

   Mr. Cockburn confuses market mechanisms. While it is true
that "in the Soviet Union prices have been . . . below
equilibrium," this is not because of "rationing by scarcity."
Rationing has little to do with it. It is because of
government price fixing. When the government sets a price
lower than the equilibrium clearing price, shortages, queues
and black markets ensue.
   In capitalism, most prices are not "above equilibrium," as
Mr. Cockburn maintains, but at equilibrium since the
government does not set the price. If it were above
equilibrium, more sellers would rush in to take advantage,
thereby depressing the price. Nor is there "rationing by
price," but allocation by price. If you can pay, you get it
-- if you can't, you don't. Thus, no shortage, queues or
black markets -- the market clears.
