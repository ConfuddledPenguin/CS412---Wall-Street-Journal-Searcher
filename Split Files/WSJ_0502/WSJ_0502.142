   SAN DIEGO -- Titan Corp. said it signed a letter of intent
to acquire M/A-Com Government Systems Inc. from M/A-Com Inc.
of Burlington, Mass. Terms of the cash acquisition weren't
disclosed.
   The M/A-Com unit, which has more than $40 million in
yearly revenue, is a supplier of earth-based satellite
communications equipment to the U.S. government. Titan makes
computer products and provides services for defense programs.
The transaction, which is subject to several conditions, is
expected to close by late June.
