   KALISPELL, Mont. -- The solitary monarch of the wild, the
grizzly rules the rugged high country. Scientists call it
"Ursus arctus horribilus," and the name suggests the terror
it inspires. Fearless and unpredictable, the bear can kill
with a single rake of a claw.
   Man is the grizzly's only natural enemy, but the clash
almost proved fatal to the species. Unrestricted hunting and
development of the animal's habitat decimated the bear
population over the last century. By 1975, when the grizzly
was placed on the federal government's Endangered Species
List, only 1,000 were thought to be alive.

   Now, federal officials say the grizzly population has
rebounded, though they concede there is no hard evidence to
support that conclusion, and they are proposing to take the
bear off the list.
   Many environmentalists, however, believe that even if the
number of bears has increased, the grizzly population is
still too small to strip the animal of federal protection.
Such a plan, they say, would be a death sentence for the
species. "If the grizzly bear is delisted, it will be
strangled by development and go extinct quite promptly," says
Lance Olsen, president of the nonprofit Great Bear
Foundation.
   Under the plan proposed by the National Parks Service,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land
Management, and the U.S. Forest Service, the grizzly would be
taken off the list in this northwestern corner of Montana,
including Glacier National Park, within the next two years.
If all goes well, the animal would be delisted next in
Yellowstone National Park, which is largely in Wyoming.
   "We came to the conclusion that the population has
recovered to our goal" of 440 in this corner of Montana, says
Lorraine Mintzmeyer, chairman of the agencies' grizzly
committee and a regional director of the National Park
Service. However, Ms. Mintzmeyer says she doesn't know how
many grizzlies there were in that area before federal
protection was extended.
   Some 535 species have the dubious distinction of having
made the Endangered Species List since it was established in
1973. The law provides for special protections, including
fines of up to $15,000 for those who illegally kill
threatened species. The grizzly would be the sixth species to
have recovered enough in the view of federal officials to be
taken off the list.
   Several environmental groups, including Mr. Olsen's, say
they will fight to halt the delisting process. They maintain
that the agencies are bowing to pressure from real estate,
tourism and logging interests, who long have sought relief
from the federal law. "We're delisting before we even know
what recovery is," says Louisa Willcox of the Greater
Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental group.
   Complicating the issue is the difficulty of determining
how many grizzlies roam the Rockies and their foothills.
Everyone concedes that the 1,000 figure for 1975 was only a
guess. Attempts to take a bear census in the years since then
have proved difficult, and no one knows how many grizzlies
there are now.
   Richard Mace, a wildlife biologist for the state of
Montana, knows how tough it is to count grizzlies. Displaying
a battered steel box with a jagged rip down one side, he
explains that the box once held a tree-mounted camera that
was rigged to snap photos when it sensed body heat from a
large animal. Biologists had placed some 43 cameras in a
section of Montana's Swan Mountains, hoping to get a more
accurate bear count.
   Apparently, Mr. Mace says, when the camera flashed, the
grizzly slashed. Its two-inch long claws ripped through the
steel casing, which is a bit thicker than a coffee can. The
bear dug out the camera, and chewed it to pieces.
   To many, the grizzly symbolizes all that was wild about
the American West. Lewis and Clark were among the first
explorers to describe the great bear. Indians, they wrote in
their journal, so greatly feared the beast that before a hunt
warriors would don paint and perform rituals as though they
were about to go to war against a neighboring tribe.
   The average bear reaches a height of six to eight feet,
and some big males may weigh as much as a half-ton. Yet
grizzlies are surprisingly nimble; they can run as fast as 25
miles an hour. Ferocious carnivores, they also dine on
berries, fruits and the succulent grasses of mountain
meadows.
   The grizzly once ruled the food chain from the Canadian
border to Mexico, from the Black Hills of South Dakota to
California. It wandered the plains and mountains until the
early 1900s, when it was pushed back into the high country by
advancing hordes of settlers. Today, the grizzly roams only
six pockets of Wyoming, Idaho, Washington and Montana.
   Chris Servheen is responsible for developing the federal
program to remove the bear from the endangered species list
in Montana, but the prospect of a bear unprotected obviously
concerns him. The slight, bespectacled wildlife biologist
smooths out a map of grizzly territory atop his desk and
points to what he thinks will be trouble spots: a proposed
oil and gas well just south of Glacier National Park,
residential lots for sale along the North Fork of the
Flathead River, and a mosaic of logging roads that snake
through mountain forests. "It scares me a lot," he admits.
   Mr. Servheen probably should worry more about the likes of
Jerry Wellington of Whitefish, Mont. Mr. Wellington doesn't
share environmentalists' fascination with the animal. He
subscribes to a code once commonly called by folks here as
"shoot, shovel and shut up."
   "I think they ought to shoot them all," says the burly,
bearded electrician, tinkering with a broken ice machine at a
tavern on the south edge of Glacier National Park. He says
the grouchy bear makes it hard for him to fish the back
country. He still goes, but armed. He won't say whether he
has shot bear, but he vows no law would stop him if he were
threatened by one. "I wouldn't tell anyone," he says. "It
just gets you in trouble."
   Not always. Westerners take a broad view of the term
"self-defense" when it comes to the grizzly. One day last
summer, according to court documents, three bears loped
across the yard of a ranch outside Dupuyer, Montana. A
concerned neighbor called to alert the owner, who grabbed his
gun, jumped into his pickup truck, and chased the bears
several miles down a road. After firing several rounds, he
killed one of the grizzlies. In February, a federal court
jury acquitted him, saying the shooting was in self defense.
   But it isn't all bad news for bears. The state of Montana
plans to draft its own program to protect the bear. And
respect for the grizzly seems to be growing among ranchers.
Many are taking precautions to keep the bear from wandering
too close to their homes and livestock. The ranchers are
putting their garbage cans at greater distances from the
homes; some are even shutting down their boneyards, where
they used to throw livestock carcasses. Now, some dump them
in the mountains, so that hungry bears don't wander out onto
the plains for food.
   A broad shift in attitude will be crucial in the future,
especially if the bear is delisted. "If you don't have local
support," says Mr. Mace, "you can't save the species."
