   SEOUL, South Korea -- The government's heavy-handed
crackdown on two major labor strikes in recent days produced
May Day sympathy strikes across the country Tuesday, ending a
relatively peaceful period in South Korean labor relations.
   But government moves to spur South Korea's ailing economy,
including the crackdown by riot police on strikers at Hyundai
Heavy Industries' Ulsan shipyard and at Korea Broadcasting
Service headquarters in Seoul, helped produce a sharp
reversal in the Seoul stock market's recent free fall. The
composite index gained 29.79 points in heavy trading Tuesday
to close at 718.45, a sharp recovery from the drop of 31.71
points, or 4.4%, on Monday, when the index hit an 18-month
low. Tuesday's rally still left the index 21% below its level
at the end of 1989.

   The labor disturbances haven't been about wages or working
conditions. Unionists are battling the government over what
they consider to be the suppression of democratic labor
rights. But the government, saying that the strikes
threatened the economy, sent riot police into Hyundai's Ulsan
shipyard at dawn Saturday to end a three-day wildcat strike
by 20,000 workers angered by the government's arrest of union
leaders. The police raid scattered the workers, though a
small group took refuge atop a giant shipyard crane, and
others have continued to fight police in Ulsan streets.
Hyundai Heavy Industries is a unit of Hyundai Corp.
   Then at midnight Monday, riot police stormed the Seoul
headquarters of Korea Broadcasting System, the
government-owned television network, where workers had been
on strike for 19 days to protest the appointment of a crony
of former dictator Chun Doo Hwan to head the organization.
Several hundred journalists and technicians were detained.
   Peaceful sympathy strikes are under way at Hyundai Motor
Co. and other Hyundai group companies in Ulsan. Munhwa
Broadcasting Corp., a second government-owned network, is
also on strike to show support for KBS workers. Several other
companies reported work slowdowns or strikes and subway
workers at several stations in Seoul reportedly were allowing
customers to ride free as a way of protesting the government
crackdown.
   Until the government acted at Hyundai and KBS, Korea was
enjoying a rare respite from labor strife. In recent months
wage settlements have averaged less than 10%, about half the
rate of the past three years, and there have been only a
fourth as many work stoppages.
   Labor experts expect the disturbances to continue for a
few weeks. Park Young Bum of the Korea Labor Institute says
the government repression challenges the unions to fight back
to show they can't be intimidated. "To a large extent, the
government provoked it," he said. "If they win Hyundai, they
win everything."
   Unlike in previous years, public support seems solidly on
the government's side. It has convinced Koreans that the
country is in an economic crisis and that worker disruptions
will doom any recovery.
   To add to Korea's disruptions, angry investors in recent
days have been invading the offices of brokerage firms and
smashing windows and furniture to vent their anger at the
plunging stock market. Many brokerage offices are shuttered
during the day and riot police are standing guard outside a
few downtown Seoul offices to fend off mobs. Threatening
phone calls have been made to brokers, government officials
and newspapers. The Wall Street Journal bureau in Seoul
received several death threats Monday after a Korean language
newspaper reported the Journal had quoted analysts as saying
they thought the market would fall further.
   To shore up investor confidence, the government yesterday
announced that in addition to the anti-strike measures it
would renew crackdowns on real-estate speculation and
consumer-price gouging. The Economic Planning Board ordered
conglomerates to sell the undeveloped real estate they are
holding for speculation, in the hope that proceeds from the
property sales will be channeled into stocks and that
inflation, fanned by real-estate speculation, will cool.
   The planning board said government efforts to fight
real-estate speculation and other economic problems wouldn't
succeed if growing labor disputes weren't checked. Some
businesses have shunned investment in the face of what they
see as excessive demands for wages and other concessions.
   Although the government's moves obviously heartened stock
investors, some brokers and market analysts were doubtful
that the market's rise would continue. "It's just a temporary
boost," said an analyst for Ssangyang Investment &amp; Securities
Co., one of the nation's biggest brokerage houses. "It's not
likely to continue because the economic fundamentals haven't
changed."
   Meanwhile, a previous plan for Korean securities houses to
create a pool of cash to buy stocks and prop up the market
appears to be doomed. Securities houses are pressed for cash
and have been calling in margin accounts to raise money. But
to settle accounts, customers have had to sell stocks, making
the market fall further.

   THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT'S choice to head state-run
Korea Broadcasting System, Soh Ki Won, identified in an
earlier edition as a crony of former dictator Chun Doo Hwan,
served in the Chun government between 1980 and 1982. But the
government says Mr. Soh wasn't a close associate of Mr. Chun,
the post was ceremonial and Mr. Soh had little influence. Mr.
Soh later worked with Seoul Shinmun newspaper.
