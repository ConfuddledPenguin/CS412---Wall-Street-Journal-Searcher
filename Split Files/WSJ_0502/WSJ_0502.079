   "COMMUNIST ENTREPRENEURS," a book by John W. Kiser III
published by Franklin Watts in 1989, served in part as the
basis for a March 30 page one article on the experiences of
three Eastern European industrial innovators. The article
also reflected substantial direct interviewing of the three
innovators by a Wall Street Journal reporter. The article
should have mentioned the book and its author. It did not.
The Journal regrets the omission.
