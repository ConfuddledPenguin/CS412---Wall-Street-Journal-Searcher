   PARIS -- Japan attempted here last month to persuade other
Group of Seven nations to conduct further foreign-exchange
market interventions in support of the yen. It had little or
no success. That's just as well, because past interventions
have been the most important factor in jeopardizing global
monetary and trade adjustment and, consequently, in damaging
U.S.-Japanese relations.
   More broadly, the accumulation by the intervening central
banks of enormous assets in foreign currencies has been,
since the third quarter of 1986, the major source of money
and credit inflation world-wide. Interest rates rose first in
London as the Bank of England tripled its dollar holdings in
1986-87, then later in Frankfurt and ultimately in Tokyo.
(The Bank of Japan had doubled its dollar holdings.) All this
was an indirect consequence of the G-7 Louvre agreement
concluded in February 1987 on the initiative of the U.S. and
France. Rises in interest rates accompanied or followed the
resurgence of inflation. It was plain inflation in Britain,
"asset inflation" (translated primarily to the stock market
and the real estate market) in Japan.

   To fully appreciate the impact the G-7 approach has on
international affairs, we have to understand why at best only
negligible results in terms of payments and trade balances
can be expected from exchange-rate movements and why
interventions nip in the bud the adjustment process.
Implicitly or explicitly, such policies derive from the basic
concept of "purchasing power parity," a cornerstone of the
classical theory of smooth balance-of-payments adjustment.
This is so even in the frequent (alas) mercantilist efforts
to undervalue currency in order to make sure that foreign
markets will be easily accessible and foreign competitors
kept at bay.
   The reason is simple: How would it be possible to speak
about an "undervalued" rate of exchange if one has not at
least a vague notion of what a correct rate looks like?
Purchasing power parity defines a "right" exchange rate --
that is, the rate at which one dollar (or any other currency)
approximately buys the same amount of goods and services in
the domestic market and abroad after having been exchanged
for the local money.
   What makes the classical theory of a smooth adjustment of
balance of payments so attractive is that it is both sound
and comforting, provided the strict assumptions on which it
is based are not ignored. If, let us say, the dollar is
"overvalued," which means that its current purchasing power
is higher abroad than at home, you can safely expect American
buying of the cheap (for them) goods and services produced
abroad while their own products, by the same token, are
priced out of foreign markets. It is hard to imagine a more
logical way to put a brake on runaway imports and to boost
exports than a change in the external value of the dollar,
back to a level as near as possible to purchasing power
parity.
   But with the current workings of the currency and
financial markets, there is not the slightest chance to see
exchange rates settle to the PPP neighborhood. If the market
rate happens to coincide with PPP (a phenomenon difficult to
measure or even identify), it is mere luck, and such a happy
coincidence never lasts long. Purchasing power parity is not
an operational concept, that is to say it cannot be
artificially promoted. It would be just as naive to think
that central banks could agree to restore PPP through
interventions as to believe that central planning can take
the place of market pricing.
   One can be tempted to object that the European Monetary
System experience somewhat contradicts this point. Within the
EMS, manifest undervaluation or overvaluation of currencies
would not be tolerated and it is a fact that so far,
collectively agreed-upon collective actions have always very
rapidly been taken to prevent such phenomena from happening.
Should not, consequently, the EMS experience be alleged as an
evidence that the so-to-speak managed PPP is possible?
   But this interpretation would miss the essential point.
According to EMS rules, a central bank (the currency of which
has to be supported by other EMS central banks) has to repay
the whole amount of the credit granted by the latter within
six months at the latest. So the adjustment process can
operate the way a classical model works. It is not so with
the international monetary system. In the international
monetary system, accumulation of dollar-denominated reserves
by non-American central banks means that the latter are
extending permanent credit to the U.S.
   At best, PPP is useful as a concept in understanding what
a market equilibrium might be like in a free-trade world
immune to distortions through monetary interferences. Look at
the confusion that reigns around the notion: Martin Feldstein
thinks that parity would hold at a yen value of 120 to the
dollar or below while Goldman Sachs International sets the
rate at 209 yen to the dollar. But even if experts could
agree on the supposedly "right" figures, central banks
through interventions would immediately distort the price
relationships.
   The reason for this can be found in an article published
by Jacques Rueff in 1922 -- a year of turbulent markets for
currencies -- that defined the strict limits within which the
PPP principle applies. He wrote that the exchange rate
between the currency of country A and the currency of country
B will gravitate toward the parity of their respective
purchasing powers only if the following condition is
satisfied: that those countries confine their respective
money issuance to discounting papers originated in economic
(production, trade, etc.) transactions.
   To gauge how far we stand from the theoretical world
referred to by Rueff, consider the way the various national
banking systems are operating today. Some countries have
effectively and reasonably abided by that rule (government
debt ultimately financed by non-financial investors, thus
excluding any monetization). West Germany and Japan are by
all accounts (with a few smaller nations) the most prominent
examples.
   But look at what happened: By the very effect of their
relatively sound monetary and financial management, the
currencies of those countries have at times appreciated with
such a vigor that it was judged necessary by the G-7 to mount
massive rescue operations for the dollar in Frankfurt and
Tokyo. The consequence of those huge interventions was to
fill the Bank of Japan, the Bundesbank, the Taiwan central
bank and others with huge holdings of dollars, which were
immediately invested in U.S. T-bills and T-bonds. What does
that mean in terms of issuance of money?
   It means that, through interventions in the exchange
markets, the monetization of U.S. government debt by
non-American central banks in recent years has been by far
the biggest source of money creation outside the U.S.
Whenever it buys dollars, the Bank of Japan issues yen, the
Bank of England issues sterling, etc.
   From the end of 1986 to the end of 1988, the net increase
of dollar-denominated holdings by European and Asian central
banks amounted to between $135 billion and $150 billion, a
formidable figure that is more than half of the total of U.S.
Federal Reserve credit. That means that the socalled
"stabilization" of the dollar, as symbolized by the Louvre
agreement, boiled down to the distribution all around the
world of a capacity to create money and credit equal to more
than half the capacity of the Fed itself.
   For the past 18 months or so, most interventions have
aimed at supporting the mark and more recently the yen.
Consequently, the mark "reserve" held by central banks
(especially the U.S. Fed) has rapidly increased, and likewise
for yen holdings. The monetary base of the world -- and
foremost the U.S. monetary base -- has expanded
commensurately.
   Central banks (with the notable exceptions of the most
anti-inflationary ones, such as the Bundesbank, the Bank of
Japan, the National Bank of Switzerland and the National Bank
of Netherlands) would argue that they can "sterilize" the
reserves so acquired. But it is not so. When a central bank
is buying foreign currencies, its interventions in the
currencies market compare with the European Community
agricultural agency acquiring all the surplus wheat offered
at the market and not demanded at the Community-set price.
The support mechanism distorts the prices of monetary claims
as surely as it distorts the prices of commodities.
   But there is something still more disturbing. The only way
for a central bank to "sterilize" newly acquired foreign
assets is to sell a corresponding amount of domestic assets
in the open market. By doing so, it raises domestic interest
rates. Remember that at the moment the G-7 was urging
European and Asian central banks to support the dollar under
the Louvre agreement the same G-7 was urging the Bank of
Japan and the Bundesbank to lower domestic rates. Such
contradictions cast doubt on the entire G-7 "global
adjustment process."
