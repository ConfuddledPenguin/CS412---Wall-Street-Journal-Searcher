   With crude oil prices off more than 20%, can lower
gasoline prices be far behind?
   The answer is, yes. Very far behind.

   "Prices should be going down, there's no question about
it," says Jerry Ferrara, executive director of the New Jersey
Gasoline Retailers Association, which represents about 3,000
service stations. But they aren't. And probably won't be.
   Domestic crude that cost refiners more than $23 a barrel
in late January now costs only about $18.50 a barrel -- and
has been as cheap as $16.50 -- but the price of gasoline has
been as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar.
   American motorists at the end of April were paying an
average of $1.01 a gallon for regular unleaded, according to
Computer Petroleum Corp., a St. Paul, Minn., tracker of
prices at 7,000 stations. That's off a scant 1% from the
nationwide average of $1.02 a gallon in January.
   What gives? Gas station owners say the oil companies are
trying to get richer by simply pocketing the reduction in raw
material costs. Not so, say several major oil companies,
which claim that other costs are eating up what might appear
to be a windfall.
   "I've been in this business long enough to know that the
reason (behind price moves) isn't always economics," says Jim
Boyajian, a fuel transportation manager for Amoco Corp. in
Chicago. Right now, he says, market psychology, seasonal
demands and new environmental costs are disrupting the
seemingly simple relationship between crude oil prices and
gasoline prices.
   Some in the industry wonder if gas stations aren't banking
a few extra cents themselves. "Any retailer will raise prices
as fast as he can and hold off as long as he can before he
lowers them," says McDonald Beavers, president of Whitney
Leigh Corp., a Tulsa, Okla., firm that monitors the gasoline
business.
   Whatever the cause, motorists have been paying summer
gasoline prices through the winter, and now, with spring at
hand, are facing more summer prices.
   The specter of finger-pointing motorists makes the pricing
issue a sensitive one at all levels of the oil industry.
Officials of Shell Oil Co., the nation's biggest seller of
gasoline, declined to be interviewed on the subject. Instead,
the company delivered a one-page discourse entitled "Why
Gasoline Prices Don't Track Crude Oil Prices." (It gently
chides "consumers and reporters" for expecting "an immediate
decrease in gasoline prices.")
   But the big oil companies -- including Shell -- concede
that over the long haul the price of gasoline really is
supposed to track the cost of crude, its main component. It's
just that sometimes there's a lag, they say. When a company
buys a $23 barrel of oil in the U.S., it may be one to three
months before that oil is refined and sold somewhere, oil
officials say. The lag can be double that if the barrel comes
from the Middle East.
   By then, the price of a new barrel of crude may have
fallen, but the cost of the old barrel was incurred and still
needs to be recovered, they explain.
   That explains most of the winter -- motorists were still
buying gasoline made with pricey crude. But then why didn't
prices fall with spring, reflecting the decline in crude
prices that had been in progress for a while?
   Blame the law of supply and demand. The oil industry was
doing a little spring cleaning. Parts of many refineries were
shut down for periodic maintenance that curbed the amount of
gasoline they produced, explains a spokesman for Conoco Inc.
in Houston, a unit of Du Pont Co. While those cutbacks
temporarily added to the world oil glut and helped further
drive down crude prices, it also created some tightness in
gasoline supplies that kept pump prices up.
   Now the maintenance work is mostly done, oil experts say.
But, alas, it is too late for a gasoline price decline.
Demand -- and prices -- are being buoyed because "we're
entering the historic beginning of the driving season," says
the Conoco spokesman.
   In addition, new and wider application of environmental
rules this year require less volatile summer gasoline, and
that is more expensive to refine, oil companies say. "We've
got some costs we're trying to recover as good businessmen,"
says Amoco's Mr. Boyajian.
   In fact, some people say consumers should feel lucky.
"Gasoline prices should have been much higher in the first
quarter, based on the cost of crude," argues Bernard Picchi,
an oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Besides, oil companies note, they aren't the only ones who
influence what motorists pay. Though they aren't anxious to
start a squabble with the service station operators who buy
their product, they point out that final pump prices are
determined at the street corner, not the refinery.
   "The dealer out there is going to get as much margin as he
can," says Bill Hermann, chief economist in San Francisco for
Chevron Corp. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."
   Mostly it doesn't, say gas station owners. "I wish my
dealers were smart enough to grab something of their own, but
they're not," says Mr. Ferrara, head of the New Jersey
retailers group. And anyway, he counters, the price his
dealers pay for regular unleaded has been -- give or take a
penny -- about 90 cents a gallon all year.
