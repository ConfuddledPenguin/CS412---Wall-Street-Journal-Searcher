   In a major coup, Coca-Cola Co. swiped Pepsi-Cola Co.'s
biggest fountain customer, the No. 2 fast-food chain, Burger
King Corp.
   In an industry where executives like to characterize
market-share battles as "one drink at a time," Coke is taking
a big gulp. Burger King, with 5,400 restaurants in the U.S.,
represents at least $270 million in lost business annually
for Pepsi, according to Jesse Meyers, publisher of trade
newsletter Beverage Digest. Coke will now have a lock on the
nation's two largest fast-food chains, Burger King and
top-ranked McDonald's Corp.

   Even more important, Mr. Meyers estimates, Burger King
accounts for about 18% of Pepsi's fountain business, which
was already far overshadowed by Coke's. Pepsi's next three
biggest customers are chains owned by its parent PepsiCo
Inc.: Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   It's that troika, the largest collection of restaurants in
the country, that industry executives believe ultimately led
Burger King to dump Pepsi. In recent years, Atlanta-based
Coke has hammered away at its central argument that fast-food
chains shouldn't use Pepsi at their fountain spigots because
that, in effect, supports a competitor. In a swipe at Pepsi,
a Coke sales brochure for restaurant managers asks: "Is your
soft-drink supplier satisfying your customers' hunger instead
of their thirst?"
   For its part, Burger King considers Pepsi's ownership of
rival chains only one factor in its decision to switch, says
a spokeswoman for the Miami-based chain, which was acquired
by London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC in January 1989. "We
looked at the whole package that Coca-Cola offered," she
says.
   The five-year deal includes a price discount -- Burger
King calls it a volume incentive program -- that "rewards
incremental volumes of syrup gallons sold over a base level."
Figures weren't disclosed. The Burger King spokeswoman
wouldn't say whether Pepsi had had a similar plan. The
agreement also includes a commitment by Coke to work on what
the chain called a state-of-the-art dispensing system to
which Burger King would eventually convert. Moreover, in what
could be a multimillion-dollar boon for Burger King, Coke
will contribute to the chain's cooperative advertising and
marketing effort.
   Burger King, which already serves Coke products overseas,
switched to Pepsi from Coke six years ago. But as part of
"vendor reviews" ordered by the chain's new management,
Burger King officials approached both soft-drink companies
earlier this year looking for a better deal. "We asked them
to submit a proposal on what they could offer us for the
1990s," the spokeswoman says.
   The loss of Burger King is a major blow to Pepsi's image
and the second such loss this year. Wendy's International
Inc., which had been involved in a lengthy legal dispute with
Pepsi over Wendy's soft-drink contract, said it plans to put
Coke in its company-owned restaurants when its Pepsi contract
expires at year end.
   With the loss of Burger King, Pepsi's share in the
soft-drink fountain market drops to about 21% from more than
26%, according to Beverage Digest. Coke's share rises to 65%
from about 60%.
   "For Pepsi, this is a big morale loss, as well as a
revenue loss," says Leenie Ruben, president of Marketing
Spectrum Inc., a market research company. "Coke will really
be controlling the fountain business with the two largest
chains."
   A Pepsi spokesman downplayed the loss. "It was not
unexpected, given the management changes that Burger King has
been going through," he said. He estimated that Burger King
accounted for about 2.4% of Pepsi's U.S. soft-drink volume
and "nominal" profit.
   Coke is getting Burger King's business at a fortuitous
time. Sales at the fast-food chain are rebounding. Moreover,
Coke's fountain business, which accounts for about one-third
of its domestic sales, has been sluggish as a result of
softness in the restaurant industry.
   The switch to Coke from Pepsi, which is based in Purchase,
N.Y., will begin in about 30 days. It may not be completed
before the summer in what Burger King said would be a
region-by-region conversion. The spokeswoman wouldn't
disclose how the chain would announce its change in soft
drinks to customers.
   Pepsi's contract with Burger King included a 60-day
cancellation clause, which Burger King said it exercised
yesterday.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Pepsi shares fell 50 cents to close at $65.75, and Coke
shares rose 50 cents to close at $76.75.
