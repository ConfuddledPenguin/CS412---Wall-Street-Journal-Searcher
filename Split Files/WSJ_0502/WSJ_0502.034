   BRITAIN'S EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK

   A prediction of increased joblessness after three and a
half years of declining unemployment is more bad news for
Margaret Thatcher's government. The Confederation of British
Industry's latest quarterly survey forecasts that
manufacturing-sector employment will drop despite
expectations of a "slight increase in output in the next four
months."
   The CBI said 34% of the 1,232 manufacturers surveyed
expect to lay off workers in the next four months. The survey
also showed that "business confidence has declined further in
response to the squeeze in home demand and lower capacity
utilization. Investment intentions remain weak in the face of
continued high interest rates."
   David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI's
economic-situation committee, said profits "are being
squeezed by severe competition and the high cost of finance
and labor." Poor domestic demand "makes it very difficult for
manufacturers to match the productivity growth achieved by
major overseas rivals."
                                                                                                       

   HONG KONG TOURISM IMPROVES
                                                                                                       

   Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong in February climbed 11% from
a year ago, showing signs of recovery from the shock of last
June's bloodshed in Beijing. The number of visitors rose to
832,047 in the year's first two months from 809,313 a year
earlier, a 3% increase. Last year, tourist arrivals in the
British colony fell for the first time in 18 years, dropping
4% to 5.36 million from 5.59 million in 1988, which saw an
increase of 24% over 1987.
                                                                                                       

   IRELAND CRACKS DOWN ON SMOKING
                                                                                                       

   Ireland launched a crackdown on smokers, with offenders to
be fined $150 if they break new anti-smoking laws. Smoking
has been banned in theaters, libraries, schools and airports
and on trains and buses; restaurants have been ordered to set
up no-smoking areas. The proportion of Irish smokers has
slumped from 45% of the population 15 years ago to 27% today,
but health authorities are concerned the decline has slowed.
                                                                                                       

   BOON FOR A MALAYSIAN COMPANY
                                                                                                       

   Malaysia's dominant political party, the United Malays
National Organization, has designated Renong Bhd. to assume
control of most of the party's vast corporate assets. The
arrangement would catapult the modest-sized property company
into one of the biggest investment-holding concerns in the
region. Analysts said the move would simplify UMNO's complex
business links and also could partly be aimed at
strengthening the party's financial base ahead of a general
election that must be held by October 1991.
                                                                                                       

   PRESERVING DENMARK'S PAST
                                                                                                       

   Danish archaeologists are working at full speed to
excavate a 1,000-year-old Viking graveyard before a motorway
obliterates the site. The recently discovered site on Zealand
island contains up to 70 graves from the 10th century, some
with well-preserved skeletons, bronze jewelry and household
objects. Officials at the Soroe Museum said it was too late
to stop work on the motorway linking Copenhagen with the port
of Korsoer. "We have only until May 4, when motorway workers
are due to move in, but with 11 men working flat out I think
we'll be able to excavate the whole site," archaeologist
Helge Nielsen said.
                                                                                                       

   TOYOTA'S EAST EUROPE PLANS
                                                                                                       

   Toyota Motor Corp. is studying plans to establish a
marketing and repair-shop network in Eastern Europe, a
company spokesman said. Although the Japanese auto maker
hasn't yet announced any firm decisions, the spokesman said
that, in light of the recent political developments in
Eastern Europe, there is potential for such expansion in the
region. He said Toyota is looking into opening marketing and
service shops in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
                                                                                                       

   LENDING TO CHINA
                                                                                                       

   The Asian Development Bank is unlikely to resume project
lending to China soon because the bank's biggest donors, the
U.S. and Japan, still oppose such credits.
   Soon after Chinese troops killed demonstrators in Beijing
last June, the ADB suspended lending to China for commercial
projects. China's delegates to the annual meeting of the
bank, which begins today in New Delhi, had hoped that the
ADB's board of governors might reconsider its decision this
week.
   U.S. officials say they are opposed to a resumption in
lending to China because the nation's economy remains
volatile. "Our position has been that we're for basic human
needs, but beyond that, we're not for it unless there's a
dedication to economic reform," said Victor Frank Jr.,
director of the U.S. delegation.
   The Japanese delegates said that economic considerations,
not politics, are behind their decision to support the U.S.
opposition to new loans.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese town of Asaji, high in the mountains of the
southern island of Kyushu, has budgeted $12,000 this year to
buy land to give away to new residents. In return, the town
requires them to build a house and stay there for 20 years.
Asaji's population has declined by half since 1955, to less
than 4,100. . . . As part of a charity event, 26 chefs in
Strasbourg, France, whipped up an 80,000-egg omelet filled
with 1,763 pounds of mushrooms, then dished out portions with
bread and drinks to 22,000 people.
