   Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Pasadena, Calif., said it
signed a mutual cooperation agreement with Maeda Corp. of
Tokyo, under which the companies will pursue engineering and
construction projects internationally.
   Initially, Jacobs and Maeda will target projects in the
U.S. A Jacobs spokesman said that neither company could
project the value of the association, but that in several
years, the agreement could produce a "substantial portion" of
both firms' business.
