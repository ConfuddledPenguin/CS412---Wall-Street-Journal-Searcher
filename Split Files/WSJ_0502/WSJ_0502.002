   Onetime corporate raider Irwin Jacobs says he's turning
"friendly."
   Mr. Jacobs, whose hostile takeover efforts once made him a
feared name in many corporate suites, now is putting together
an investment fund to help cash-strapped companies right
themselves. If necessary, he'll even contribute some
management know-how.

   Similar to other investment vehicles now combing through
debris of the junk-bond collapse, Mr. Jacobs's World Fund
L.P. is designed as a limited-partnership investment for
wealthy individuals and other sophisticated investors from
around the world.
   But several others with the same idea have run into
financing problems themselves. For example, Forstmann, Little
&amp; Co., a big player in the leveraged buy-out game, has been
struggling to raise $2 billion from pension funds and
insurance companies for a similar fund.
   Although his fund is in the formative stages -- there's no
prospectus yet -- Mr. Jacobs envisions the fund as having
perhaps as much as a billion dollars to invest, but only on
good terms. "No unfriendly transactions -- which may sound
strange to some people," concedes Mr. Jacobs, who once had a
pirate ship made from the beer cans of a brewery he
unsuccessfully fought to acquire.
   To prove he's not just talk, Mr. Jacobs yesterday offered
to pump perhaps $20 million into Munsingwear Inc., a
struggling apparel maker within view of his Minneapolis
office. If Munsingwear accepts, the investor would put $8
million in cash in the corporate coffers in exchange for an
80% equity ownership. Also, he would offer to buy out other
shareholders at $2 a share, a price that, before his bid was
announced, represented a premium.
   Munsingwear closed yesterday at $2, up 12.5 cents, in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading. The Jacobs deal
also calls for Munsingwear debtholders to agree to sell $34
million in 8% debt at no more than 25% of face value. That
price also would represent a premium, because the debt was
trading yesterday at $21 to $23 for each $100 face value.
   Munsingwear, Mr. Jacobs says, is a good example of the
opportunities he thinks will proliferate in coming months.
While its continuing operations are losing money, "there's a
nucleus there to build something beyond where they are, to
bring back the heritage they once had," he added, dismissing
the likelihood of an asset sale.
   "We're no threat to the management," Mr. Jacobs insists.
   Still, he's not planning to be simply a passive investor
who says to management, "We trust you." "Our people will be
involved, to be sure our investments will be handled
properly," he says.
   Certain opportunities will be shunned, though. Vowing a
"very conservative" approach, Mr. Jacobs says his fund would
avoid businesses "that we think are too highly leveraged and
have no possibility of being able to service their debt."
   A big investment fund isn't a new idea for the investor.
He talked about one in 1985, shortly after he pulled off what
has proven to be his biggest hostile takeover, the
acquisition of AMF Inc. At the time, Mr. Jacobs said numerous
overseas investors had approached him looking for ways to
come aboard the takeover train.
   But soon leveraged buy-out specialists such as Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. had replaced individual raiders, so for
several years Mr. Jacobs has maintained a relatively low
profile, occasionally going after a small company, but
concentrating on melding his various operating companies into
solid, if dull, moneymakers.
   His portfolio of businesses includes Watkins Products
Inc., a household products distributor; Insty-Prints copies;
Brown Minneapolis Tank Co.; and several regional boat makers
that he has merged into Genmar Industries Inc., now believed
to be his largest entity.
   If his hopes for World Fund develop, Mr. Jacobs plans to
use it to "go into industries where we can have a major
foothold." He didn't elaborate.
