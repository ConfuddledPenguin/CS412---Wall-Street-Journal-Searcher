   Concerning your March 23 page-one article on Orbital
Sciences Corp: It would seem the press is unable to portray
those who seek to develop space as anything but "Space Nuts."
In fact, Orbital Sciences is a small but robust company that
has conservatively paced its growth and ambitions. Reducing
the efforts and success of more than 500 employees, over many
years, to an almost cartoonlike depiction is a gross
injustice to both OSC and all those entrepreneurial companies
that strive to create value in the use of space.
