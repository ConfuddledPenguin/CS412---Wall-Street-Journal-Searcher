   MOSCOW -- Soviet leaders headed by President Mikhail
Gorbachev walked out of Red Square in the middle of May Day
celebrations as the workers' parade turned into an
unprecedented protest against their rule.
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators whistled and jeered as
grim-faced members of the Politburo and Presidential Council
left their positions atop Lenin's Mausoleum and headed for
the privacy of the Kremlin after 90 minutes. The
demonstration continued for an hour before it was dispersed
by KGB security police and a dozen cleaning trucks spraying
water.

   Many of the marchers carried banners attacking Mr.
Gorbachev personally and socialism in general. "The
Ceausescus of the Politburo should get out of their armchairs
and go to jail," read one. "Communists -- Don't have any
illusions, you're bankrupt," read another. "Gorbachev --
Enough of making fools of the people. Resign]" said a third.
   Dozens of demonstrators protested Moscow's strong-arm
tactics against Lithuania, which declared its independence
last month. They waved yellow, red and green Lithuanian flags
or placards calling for freedom for the Baltic republic and
an end to the economic blockade imposed by Moscow. "Free
Lithuania -- Shame on the imperialist president," one banner
read.
   The parade was the most vivid display of public anger at
the Kremlin's rule to date. The slogans are typical of
demonstrations that have taken place in the Soviet capital
and elsewhere in recent weeks. But by taking to Red Square
itself, a place almost sacrosanct in Soviet lore, the
radicals noisily underscored the growing national mood of
rebellion.
   As they moved past huge portraits of Marx, Engels and
Lenin on the wall of a department store opposite Lenin's
tomb, one group of protestors unfurled a banner declaring,
"Marxism-Leninism -- On the trash heap of history." Walking
behind a priest carrying a cross was another group with a
placard reading: "Gorbachev is the chief patron of the
mafia."
   They were allowed to take part in the parade after Moscow
authorities decided to open it up this year to a wider
public. In the past, only hand-picked labor union and other
officials marched past the mausoleum while the leadership
looked on and waved. But Moscow's Communist Party leader,
Yuri Prokofiev, last week threw open participation to anyone
to reflect the new official tolerance of pluralism. Mr.
Prokofiev said at the time that "anti-constitutional slogans"
wouldn't be allowed.
   As the protest got out of hand, organizers were at a loss
as to how to react. Festive music continued to blare from
loud speakers around the square after the Soviet leadership
departed, while KGB officers in dress uniform carried on
strutting up and down in front of Lenin's tomb.
   Behind the mausoleum, Mr. Prokofiev and Gavriil Popov, the
radical economist recently elected mayor of Moscow, conferred
grimly for about 15 minutes. Mr. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa,
came over to talk with them briefly before joining her
husband inside the Kremlin.
   Soviet television, which usually broadcasts the whole
event, cut off its transmission just before Mr. Gorbachev and
his colleagues left. In its evening news program, it said "a
few people" had spoiled the parade's festive atmosphere, but
didn't show either the Kremlin leadership leaving or any of
the most critical slogans. The official Tass news agency, in
an unusually brief report about the proceedings, said only
that "some slogans were extremist. They called for direct
confrontation with constitutional authorities, not
consolidation of forces."
   Its report dwelled on the unorthodox, more open nature of
the rally. "The pluralism of slogans is graphic evidence," it
reported blandly. "Only recently it was difficult to imagine
some of the placards appearing in Red Square."
   The May Day celebration started as planned, with 40
minutes of speeches by labor officials largely echoing
slogans of the leadership, including calls for a market
economy. Workers then paraded through the square with
balloons and offical placards calling for "real wages for
real work," and rejecting unemployment.
   Then the radicals took over. Apart from the many attacks
on Mr. Gorbachev and socialism, their banners reflected a
grabbag of grievances. "Gorbachev is the president of the
Kremlin-Yeltsin is president of the people," read one,
referring to Mr. Gorbachev's recent election by the
parliament to the newly established presidency. Radicals
wanted a national vote. "Let the Communist Party live in
Chernobyl," read another banner, referring to the site of a
major nuclear accident in 1986.
   The last big rally held in the vicinity took place in
February, about 500 yards away from Red Square, when
protestors called for the Communist Party to relinquish its
monopoly on power. That demonstration was widely believed to
have been officially orchestrated to put pressure on the
Central Committee, which met later that week to discuss the
issue. But since then no rallies have been allowed so close
to the seat of Soviet power. In fact, the government last
month banned all demonstrations in the center of Moscow. The
decision angered radicals in the newly elected city council,
which used to have jurisdiction over such matters.
