   Emerson Electric Co. pleaded guilty in federal court in
St. Louis to inflating cost proposals on certain military
contracts, and agreed to pay $14 million as part of a
settlement with the government.
   The agreement stems from allegations by the government
that at least from Jan. 1, 1983, to Sept. 30, 1987, Emerson's
Electronics and Space division submitted "false and inflated"
cost and price figures on contracts on which it was the only
supplier.

   Specifically, Emerson pleaded guilty to four counts of
making false statements on government contracts for equipment
used to test instruments on military aircraft. In addition to
the $14 million civil settlement, which goes to the Defense
Department, the company agreed to pay fines totaling $40,000.
   The settlement closes a two-year grand jury investigation
of the St. Louis maker of electric and electronic products.
The investigation became public in February 1988 when a team
of Defense Department investigators made a surprise search of
the division's Ferguson, Mo., plant.
   Investigators were trying to determine whether the company
illegally switched military vehicle parts from a U.S. program
to vehicles sold to Egypt.
   U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Dittmeier, whose office led the
investigation, said in an interview the search led to
evidence of the cost overestimates. He also said his office
found "possible criminal violations" in Emerson's parts
transfer practices, but said it allowed the company to plea
only to the cost charges as part of the agreement.
   Joe Adorjan, Emerson vice chairman, denied in an interview
any wrongdoing by the company in the parts transfer area. But
he called the guilty plea on the cost charges "a serious
event for us."
   Emerson said it negotiated the civil settlement to
"resolve a number of open issues" with the Defense
Department. It also said in a statement that the agreement
"is in the best economic interest of shareholders." It said
it included the settlement in its second-quarter results
announced yesterday, in which it said profit rose nearly 6%
to $156.2 million, or 70 cents a share. Sales rose nearly 6%
to $1.91 billion.
   While it's not about to interrupt Emerson's 32-year string
of higher earnings, the plea agreement further tarnishes the
company's reputation in the defense business. The Defense
Department could still bar the company from contracts, but
Mr. Adjoran said in the interview that the company is
"optimistic" that won't happen.
   Both Emerson Electric and the U.S. attorney said the
company corrected the cost-estimating systems before the
government investigation began, and that Emerson cooperated
in the investigation.
   Early last year, the Navy suspended Emerson's Hazeltine
unit from competing for and receiving new government
contracts. The three-month suspension came after Hazeltine
pleaded guilty to conspiracy and other charges in the
Pentagon procurement scandal.
   In March 1989, a former Hazeltine executive was sentenced
to three months in jail after admitting that he conspired to
obtain inside information about competitors' bids on a
contract.
