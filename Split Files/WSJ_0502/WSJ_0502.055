   LOWELL, Mass. -- Courtney Wang, youngest son of the late
An Wang, was named a director of Wang Laboratories Inc.,
taking his father's seat on the board.
   Courtney Wang, 33 years old, is a Wang Laboratories vice

mother, Lorraine Wang, 70, and older brother Frederick A.
Wang, 39, are already Wang directors.

   The Wang family controls the computer maker through
holdings of Class C stock that elect a majority of the board.
They have said they plan to retain their ownership.
   An Wang was chairman and chief executive officer before he
died of cancer in March. Frederick Wang was president of Wang
for two years, but he resigned last summer in the wake of
huge losses, management turmoil and a debt crisis.
   Richard Miller, 49, a former General Electric Co.
executive, succeeded Frederick Wang and after An Wang's death
was named chairman and chief executive as well.
