   Tokyo stock prices firmed in last-hour buying by
investment trust funds and other participants, after moving
narrowly in lackluster trading most of the day.
   In London, share prices finished mostly higher, carried
along on a technical recovery that began at the start of the
week.

   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 105.03 points
at 29689.83. The index gained 160.22 points Friday. The
market is open only yesterday and today this week because of
national holidays.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose 362.69 points to
close the morning session at 30052.52.
   Tuesday's trading was razor-thin. Lack of attractively
priced shares encouraged individuals and some fund managers
to extend their holidays, traders said. Investors who were
present also stayed on the sidelines, leaving their positions
untouched out of caution they could be overtaken by movements
on overseas financial markets later in the week, traders
added.
   A low 240 million shares were estimated to have changed
hands on the first section, down from 488 million shares
Friday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 467 to 427,
while 205 issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which gained 5.86 points Friday, was up 8.82
points, or 0.40%, at 2214.78.
   The second section index gained 16.19 points, or 0.46%, to
close at 3547.14. The index advanced 15.23 points Friday.
Volume was estimated at seven million shares, down from nine
million shares Friday.
   Traders said the market mood remained stable despite
growing expectations about higher interest rates in the U.S.
and West Germany.
   Although the market will be closed later this week, many
participants will be closely watching the results of the
Bundesbank's regular meeting tomorrow. Friday's announcement
of U.S. employment data is also a focus of attention amid
concerns about growing inflationary pressure in the U.S.,
which could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to maintain
higher interest rates, traders said.
   But relatively stable foreign exchange and bond markets in
Tokyo helped many participants hold on to a perception that
the yen's sharp and continuous slide is unlikely, said
Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan
Securities.
   "If the U.S. or West Germany raises its interest rate, the
yen will be sold against the dollar and mark, but to a
limited level," the official added.
   Because of expectations that high-technology shares may be
established as a focus of trade in May starting next week,
investors, including investment trust funds and some
institutions, picked up these stocks, traders said.
   The prospect of a weaker yen encouraged buying of such
export-oriented sectors, but investors aren't fully confident
on committing themselves to any sectors at the moment, said
Atsushi Koishihara, general manager of the equity division at
Taiheiyo Securities.
   A broad range of electronics shares finished higher
yesterday. Winners included Sony, which rose 180 yen to 8650
yen ($1.13 to $54.45), and TDK, which was up 180 yen at 7060
yen. Both were supported by buying by one of the Big Four
Japanese brokerage houses, traders said.
   Sharp added 10 yen to 1720 yen, while Hitachi closed at
1600 yen, up 20 yen.
   Plant engineering companies were popular for their strong
earnings outlooks, reflecting increasing plant exports,
traders said. Chiyoda Corp. gained 50 yen to 2330 yen, while
Toyo Engineering Corp. advanced 40 yen to 1980 yen.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share
index finished up 14.5 points at 2117.9, about midway between
the intraday high of 2126 reached at around midafternoon and
the low of 2111.4 posted just after the start of official
trading.
   At the close, the Financial Times 30 share index was up
9.9 points at 1663.5. Volume was 370.8 million shares, mildly
better than 326.3 million a day earlier.
   Among individual stocks, pharmaceutical Glaxo gained 16
pence to 762 pence (26 cents to $12.51) in sympathy with
Britain's largest chemicals concern, Imperial Chemical
Industries, which released a bullish set of first-quarter
earnings Monday. ICI added six pence to #10.86.
   Enterprise Oil leaped 15 pence to 570 pence, while Lasmo
fell 12 pence to 361 pence after a 1-for-2 stock split.
Several traders suggested investors might have switched from
Lasmo to Enterprise.
   Large gainers included retail group Great Universal
Stores, which rose 15 pence to 909 pence, and STC, which
climbed nine pence to 243 pence after a positive tone to the
annual shareholders meeting convened during the session.
   Meanwhile, Amsterdam prices closed lower. Other European
and South African markets were closed for May Day.
   Stocks closed higher in Sydney, Wellington and Seoul;
lower in Taipei; and mixed in Hong Kong. The markets in
Singapore and Manila were closed for holidays.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
