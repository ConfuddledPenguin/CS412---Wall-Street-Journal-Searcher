   Fund American Cos., Greenwich, Conn., said first-quarter
net income fell 4.3% to $34.9 million, or 65 cents a share,
mainly reflecting continued weak pricing in the
property-casualty insurance market.
   The company, formerly Fireman's Fund, had a underwriting
loss of $130.3 million in its property-casualty business. For
every dollar of premium the insurer took in during the
quarter, the company paid out $1.19 in claims and other
expenses.

   Revenue advanced 9% to $904 million from $831 million. The
1990 results included a pretax $30 million realized
investment gain. The company had net of $36.5 million, or 66
cents a share, in the 1989 period.
   The slump in the equity and bond markets hurt results,
reducing Fund American's per-share book value to $35.04 from
$36.21 at Dec. 31. Pretax unrealized appreciation in the
company's portfolio of equity securities declined to $93
million, and the excess of market value over book value on
the company's fixed-maturity portfolio declined $68 million
to $13 million as of March 31. However, the $30 million in
pretax realized investment gain offset some of the unrealized
losses.
