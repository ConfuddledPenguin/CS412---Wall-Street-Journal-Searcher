   NEW YORK -- Government leaders tentatively agreed on a
broad expansion of the New York sales tax as a way to deal
with the state's budget deficit.
   The agreement, reached among legislative leaders and Gov.
Mario Cuomo in Albany, would extend the state sales tax for
the first time to services such as custom computer
programming, management consulting and public relations. The
sales tax package would generate about $380 million a year,
said a spokesman for Ralph Marino, New York state Senate
majority leader.

   The tax plan received an angry reaction from New York's
service business community. Burson-Marsteller, a public
relations firm, said the tax plan "can result only in lower
employment for public relations practitioners in New York
state and lower profits for businesses like ours."
   The New York chapter of the Public Relations Society of
America said the industry and its suppliers "generate more
than $554 million in business in the state. In our
information-intensive society, a tax on such services will
result in public relations businesses being at a competitive
disadvantage since the vast majority of states do not levy
such a tax."
   The proposed service tax is "really a disservice tax,
because it will drive service businesses from New York to
surrounding states," said Michael Henning, managing partner
of the New York office of Ernst &amp; Young, an accounting and
consulting firm. "It's ill-conceived, hastily drafted and
extremely dangerous."
   Service taxes aren't the only means to boost revenues
being considered by New York legislators as they try to close
a budget gap of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. The state has
been operating without a budget since the fiscal year began
April 1. Government leaders have also tentatively agreed to
impose a temporary surcharge on corporate net incomes that
could generate an additional $340 million to $510 million a
year in revenues.
   But with states facing decreased revenues and the economy
becoming increasingly service oriented, there is growing
pressure to tax areas that previously haven't been taxed.
   Service companies have been fighting back. In Florida,
opposition to a tax on advertising in 1987 was so strong that
the bill was repealed after just a few months. More recently,
a number of other states have tried to impose advertising
taxes, usually without success.
   Under the agreement reached in Albany, New York's sales
tax would be extended to magazine sales and telephone calls
to 900-numbers. New York state currently imposes a 4% sales
tax on most consumer goods; in addition, counties levy an
extra 3% to 4.25% sales tax.
   James Gifford, executive vice president of the New York
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that levying taxes on
services is subject to confusion. "One of our concerns is
that economic consulting is a very imprecise term and you
could sweep in a whole range of activities that are part and
parcel of the investment banking community," he said. But Mr.
Gifford said the group doesn't object to the proposed state
surcharge on corporate profits because it is a "broad-based
and temporary tax."
