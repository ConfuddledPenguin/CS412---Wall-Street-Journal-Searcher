   Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, a New Orleans-based
limited partnership affiliate of Freeport-McMoRan Inc., said
it agreed to acquire oil and gas reserves from Chevron U.S.A.
Inc. for $137 million in cash plus $13 million in development
costs already incurred. Chevron U.S.A. is a subsidiary of
Chevron Corp.
   The partnership estimates it will spend about $100 million
for the development of the reserves. Currently estimated at
35 million to 50 million barrels of oil and eight billion
cubic feet of natural gas, the reserves are located in the
same caprock reservoir on Main Pass Block 299 as the
partnership's sulphur reserves. They were discovered when the
partnership drilled for sulphur exploration wells.
</LP>

   Chevron, which developed the discovery, has retained the
right, under certain conditions, to participate in the
proceeds of future production if the price or volumes exceed
certain levels.
   Main Pass Block 299 is located offshore Louisiana in the
Gulf of Mexico, about 90 miles southeast of New Orleans.
