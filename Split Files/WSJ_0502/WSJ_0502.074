   WASHINGTON -- Financial leaders of the Group of Seven
industrial countries plan to meet here Sunday to try to
resolve complex issues that are holding up a proposed capital
increase for the International Monetary Fund.
   The sticking points include how to deal with countries
that have prolonged overdue payments and how to settle a
dispute between France and Britain about their respective
rankings in the IMF.

   "It's by no means certain that we'll reach an agreement on
the quota this weekend, but I think we will," said a U.S.
Treasury official. He cautioned, however, that "even when
(the G-7) agrees, they may have trouble selling it to the
whole membership" of the IMF.
   The Group of Seven includes the finance ministers and the
central bank presidents of the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada. They are the most powerful
shareholders of the IMF and the World Bank. Their meeting on
Sunday will be followed by the regular semiannual meetings of
the IMF and the World Bank on Monday and Tuesday.
   The G-7 also will discuss international financial
developments, including the continued weakness of the yen.
But in contrast to the group's most recent meeting in Paris,
supporting the yen probably won't be a major focus. Japan's
currency and stock market have recovered some stability.
Moreover, the U.S. Treasury, which plans a refunding of more
than $30 billion in U.S. debt next week, is likely to be
eager for the meeting to avoid major statements on currencies
or interest rates.
   The IMF has sought a 100% increase in member
contributions, or quotas, which total about $120 billion. But
due to opposition from the U.S. and others, the fund probably
will have to settle for half that.
   The U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Britain, which is
currently the IMF's second largest shareholder, insist that
the arrears problem be settled before IMF capital is
increased. But it could take months to sort out the problem,
and that may mean that the capital increase won't take effect
until the end of 1991, officials say.
   As of Jan. 31, $3.4 billion of payments due the IMF were
more than six months overdue; more than $500 million of this
amount was more than three years overdue. Eleven countries
were delinquent. Sudan, Zaire and Peru are among the most
severely indebted to the IMF.
   Recently there has been some progress in working out ways
of dealing with these arrears, a senior monetary official
said this week. Nevertheless, the U.S. is pushing a complex
plan to resolve the problem that would involve changing the
IMF's charter. It would backstop additional bridge loans to
the delinquent countries with gold those same countries have
previously provided the IMF to meet their quotas. The
additional loans would help the countries work out their
arrears, but if they failed to live up to their obligations,
their gold would be sold to make good the IMF's claims
against them.
   The U.S. and 19 other IMF board member countries are
proposing using three million ounces of gold, roughly the
amount of gold the delinquent countries originally deposited
with the IMF. But two other board members -- Japan and West
Germany, who will provide the largest part of the bridge
loans -- want more gold backing.
   Meanwhile, France is asking that it be given an equal rank
in the IMF with Britain. Technically, Britain would have a 6%
share in the fund after the quota increase, and France would
have a 5.1% share, but Paris is asking for parity, with each
country having about 5.4% or 5.5%.
   There is considerable speculation that some arrangement
involving the siting of the new European Bank for
Reconstruction &amp; Development in London may persuade the
British to cut their quota a little.
