   WHAT IF APRIL 15 were just another spring day for paid-up
taxpayers?
   That's what the IRS wants to make it in 1992, by
eliminating over six million formal requests for filing
extensions. That many people whose returns weren't ready
needed tax-day postmarks on Form 4868 requests for extensions
to Aug. 15. Taxpayers expended seven million hours and over
$1.5 million in postage on the forms, the IRS figures; it
allots the equivalent of over 250 annual jobs to do the
paperwork. Yet 80% of the extended returns will claim
refunds. Couldn't that time and expense be saved?

   The IRS Commissioner's Advisory Group of outside tax
experts posed that question last year. The IRS replied last
week: It plans to do away with Form 4868 requests for 1991
returns due in 1992 and to make extensions really automatic.
Returns filed by Aug. 15 would be treated as filed on time --
as long as the filers had made minimum tax payments by April
15 through withholding or other means. The IRS would approve
or deny extensions after returns were filed.
   The minimum payment required now is either 90% of the
current year's liability or 100% of the prior year's tax.
                                                                                                       

   AUTOMATIC EXTENSIONS would be effortless in 1992 for folks
owed refunds.
   They would merely delay their refunds by filing returns
after April 15. For people owing tax, the IRS will devise a
payment coupon due April 15. Those paying at least 90% of the
tax by April 15 and the balance with returns by Aug. 15 would
incur interest on the balance, but no penalty. Filers who
paid 100% of the prior year's tax but less than 90% of the
current year's by April 15 would owe interest and a
failure-to-pay penalty on the balance paid Aug. 15, but not
the heavier failure-to-file penalty.
   Details must be ironed out. Now, taxpayers may seek a
further return extension to Oct. 15 by filing Form 2688. The
IRS is considering making that extension automatic as well,
for people who qualify for the first extension and who pay
100% of the tax due by Aug. 15; people who don't pay 100%
would have to request a hardship extension in writing. The
IRS hasn't decided whether refund returns would qualify for
automatic extensions to Oct. 15 instead of Aug. 15.
                                                                                                       

   INCOME GUARANTEES to new doctors don't jeopardize this
hospital's exemption.
   A 1986 IRS opinion said a guarantee to a nonemployee
doctor might divert hospital earnings to private use and void
its charitable exemption. But lawyer Gerald Peters of
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &amp; Enersen, San Francisco, says the
IRS has approved a plan that is "a significant structural
breakthrough" for an unidentified 512-bed hospital. Trying to
resuscitate its failing cancer-therapy program, the hospital
offered one-year guarantees of $75,000 and $150,000 to two
doctors to set up private practices nearby and manage the
program.
   The guaranteed income would be reduced by the amounts of
the doctors' private income; and the doctors are to repay the
hospital's advances, in installments over four years. But the
hospital would waive part of the repayment for each year a
doctor stayed on and forgive 100% of the debt if the doctor
stayed four years.
   The plan is in accord with exempt hospital aims, as long
as the compensation is reasonable, the IRS ruled.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHIEF OF STAFF of Congress's joint tax committee,
Ronald A. Pearlman, plans to resign at the end of the year. A
lawyer, he says he hasn't decided where he will go. His
successor hasn't been named. Pearlman has headed the staff
since March 1988 and served earlier as assistant Treasury
secretary for tax policy.
                                                                                                       

   GAMBLING LOSSES appeared improperly on business schedules
of many 1989 personal returns. Other common problems, say IRS
compliance checkers, were errors in figuring employee
business costs and in reporting dependent-care costs and
rollovers of individual-retirement-account funds.
                                                                                                       

   STATE AUDITORS from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, New
Hampshire, and Pennsylvania are visiting 1,016 Southern
California firms that may owe sales or corporate taxes. The
teams have scoured the Silicon Valley and Washington areas.
North Carolina's Research Triangle may be next.
                                                                                                       

   ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S estate must pay tax on homes he gave to
family members.
   Over 15 years after the national black Muslim leader's
death, the Tax Court has ruled on issues involving his gifts
of four homes near his own in Chicago to two sons and a
daughter and their spouses and to one grandson. The family
members held high posts in the sect. They provided protection
for the leader and helped care for him during his last
illness. Shortly before dying in February 1975, Elijah
Muhammad gave them the homes they had been living in.
   The estate contended that the leader transferred the
homes, valued at $120,000 each, in return for adequate
consideration, including services rendered. But the IRS said
the transfers were taxable gifts. Now Judge Fay says the
estate produced no evidence beyond uncorroborated testimony
to support its claim. The judge says the gifts were made in
contemplation of death and are subject to gift tax and that
the homes must be included in the estate's value.
   But the judge has rejected the IRS's assessment of
negligence penalties.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: President Bush named James Halpern, 44, of Baker &amp;
