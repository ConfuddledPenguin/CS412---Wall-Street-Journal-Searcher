   Millard Drexler, president of the Gap Inc., credited with
rejuvenating the apparel chain, sold 368,000 shares in
January and March for $23 million, according to the company's
proxy statement. Since most of the shares were granted him
under his compensation agreement, most of the $23 million is
a net gain to him.
   Mr. Drexler also received salary and cash bonuses last
year totaling $1,745,981. He still owns 1.2 million
restricted shares, obtained through grants, currently worth
nearly $78 million. Mr. Drexler transformed the Gap from a
jeans reseller to a more successful casual-wear chain with
more diversified merchandise, in the process driving up the
San Bruno, Calif.-based company's earnings and stock price
over the past three years.
