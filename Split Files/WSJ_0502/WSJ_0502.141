   LONDON -- Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International said it
had a net loss of $498 million in 1989, largely as a result
of $600 million in loan charges.
   The closely held bank, which had a net loss of $48 million
in 1988 after loan provisions totaling $145 million, also
confirmed that the Abu Dhabi government injected $400 million
to help it meet international loan standards. The injection,
which included the issue of new shares in the bank, boosted
Abu Dhabi's stake to 77%.

   Earlier this week, it was reported that Abu Dhabi had
become the majority holder of BCCI by acquiring a 20% stake
held by Saudi Arabia's Bin-Mahfouz family. Even before the
acquisition and cash injection, the emirate and its ruling
family members represented the largest block of shareholders
in the bank, which is based in Luxembourg.
   BCCI said it had operating profit before loan provisions
of $224 million, up from $192 million in 1988. It added that
total capital after the cash injection was $1.48 billion, up
from $1.42 billion at the end of 1988. Total assets were
$23.5 billion, up from $20.6 billion.
   BCCI didn't disclose full 1989 operating results. Its
brief statement followed reports that it would announce sharp
losses for the year and possibly sweeping organizational
changes.
