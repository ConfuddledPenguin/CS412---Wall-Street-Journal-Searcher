   NEW YORK -- In Hollywood's latest foray into Broadway,
Warner Bros. agreed to make a film version of Andrew Lloyd
Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera."
   The subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. said it signed an
agreement with the British composer to produce a movie
version of the hit show, which started in London and has been
doing sell-out business in New York since opening here two
years ago. "Phantom" is also playing in Toronto and Los
Angeles and opens next month in Chicago.

   Warner and a spokesman for Mr. Webber declined to disclose
financial terms of the production agreement, or what the
projected budget of the movie will be, though like the stage
play it is expected to be a lavish production. Mr. Webber
will produce the film, which will star the original stage
stars Michael Crawford and Mr. Webber's wife, Sarah
Brightman. The movie will be directed by Joel Schumacher,
whose recent credits include Warner's teen vampire movie "The
Lost Boys."
   The agreement to produce "Phantom" is the latest in a
number of recent moves by Hollywood studios to make movies
out of hit Broadway shows. A new show that started
off-Broadway, "Prelude to a Kiss," recently sparked a heated
bidding war for movie rights among studios; News Corp.'s 20th
Century Fox Film Co. won with a $1 million offer.
   Producing the movie version of "Phantom" will be Mr.
Webber's first film project since the 1972 film version of
his musical "Jesus Christ Superstar."
