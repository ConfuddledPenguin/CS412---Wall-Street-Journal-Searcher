   Jerrico Inc., Lexington, Ky., said it agreed to sell two
restaurant chains and plans to sell a third to enable Jerrico
to concentrate on its Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppes.
   The company will sell its 23 company-owned Jerry's
family-style restaurants and franchise rights to 23
franchised Jerry's units to Great American Restaurants Inc.,
Atlanta. Jerrico declined to disclose the sale price.

   In addition, Jerrico said it agreed to sell Fazoli's, a
five-restaurant Italian-food unit, and plans to sell the
two-restaurant Florenz unit, which also sells Italian food.
   The Long John Silver's unit has about 1,500 restaurants,
two-thirds of them owned by Jerrico. The company said it
wants to add 200 franchised units within five years.
