   Hit by a decline in market demand from Britain and France,
the Anglo-Dutch truck builder DAF N.V. revised its forecast
for the first half to a loss of between 20 million guilders
and 30 million guilders ($10.6 million and $15.9 million).
   In its annual report for 1989, DAF initially predicted
profit for the 1990 first half would be lower than the
year-earlier 74 million guilders. The expected loss owes
largely to high British interest rates that are cutting
demand for trucks, DAF said, and to a volatile and weakening
pound that is hurting DAF's profitability on trucks sold in
Britain. The company didn't indicate why demand for light,
commercial trucks in France is declining.

   DAF still maintains it will show a profit for all of 1990,
though it didn't specify a sum. It said a productivity
program and stringent profit controls being put into effect
should be enough to lift the company back to profitability in
the second half.
   Overall for this year, DAF said, it expects to maintain
its commercial vehicle production at the 1989 level of
58,660.
