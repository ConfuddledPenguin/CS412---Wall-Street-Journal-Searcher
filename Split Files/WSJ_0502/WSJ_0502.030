   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration endorsed legislation
that would substantially stiffen some penalties for
employers' workplace-safety violations.
   Testifying before the Senate labor subcommittee, Gerard
Scannell, assistant secretary of labor, said the Labor
Department supports provisions of pending bills that would
triple potential civil penalties for safety and health
violations and upgrade from misdemeanors to felonies any
willful violations that cause death.

   Tripling civil penalties, as provided in a bill offered by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), could sharply escalate
fines imposed by the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, which Mr. Scannell heads. It would
allow fines of $30,000 for each violation; currently, the
limit is $10,000 per violation, which, in recent years, has
itself resulted in multimillion-dollar OSHA citations against
some large employers.
   Last month, for instance, the agency proposed fines of
$5.7 million against Phillips Petroleum Co., stemming from
explosions in October at a Houston-area plastics plant, which
killed 23 workers. Earlier, OSHA proposed a record $7.3
million in fines against USX Corp., citing numerous health
and safety violations at two plants.
   While the citations usually are sharply scaled down in
settlements, Mr. Scannell said that since 1986, the agency
has issued about 100 citations for "egregious" violations to
about 90 employers. He said about two-thirds of those
citations have already been settled, "securing swift
abatement of hazards," and resulted in about $15 million in
fines.
   Mr. Scannell also backed changing to felonies from
misdemeanors those willful violations that lead to death in
order to encourage U.S. attorneys to prosecute such OSHA
cases.
   Mr. Scannell's testimony also contained the Labor
Department's first formal declaration that OSHA enforcement
doesn't preempt state and local prosecution of employer
misconduct involving workplace health or safety violations.
States shouldn't be pre-empted from enforcing criminal laws
that deal with murder, manslaughter or assault, he said. But
he said that purely regulatory laws, which make it a crime
for employers to violate particular health or safety
standards, should be pre-empted unless they're part of an
OSHA-approved state regulatory plan.
   Although OSHA has been working with state and local
prosecutors who pursue criminal workplace health or safety
cases against employers, the department previously hadn't
taken a stand on the preemption issue. The Justice
Department, however, has stated that OSHA doesn't pre-empt
such prosecutions.
