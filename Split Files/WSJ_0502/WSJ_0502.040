   AMSTERDAM -- Dutch imports equaled exports in February,
with exports growing 3% and imports rising 8%, both to 18.4
billion guilders ($9.75 billion), from 17.9 billion guilders
and 17.1 billion guilders, respectively, a year earlier, the
Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics said.
   For the first two months of this year, the Netherlands
posted a trade surplus of 500 million guilders, with exports
amounting to 37.9 billion guilders and imports 37.4 billion
guilders. Exports rose 5.5% from the year-earlier 35.9
billion guilders, and imports rose 9.4% from 34.2 billion
