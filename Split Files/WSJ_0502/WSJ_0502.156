   NEW YORK -- A stronger-than-expected economic report
triggered a sell-off in the bond market.
   Bonds got off to a strong start in early trading, with
prices rising as much as 3/8 point, or $3.75 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount. But the gains vanished after the
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index
of business activity rose in April to the highest level in a
year.

   The index was 50.2% in April, up from 48.8% in March. An
index reading above 50% indicates the manufacturing sector of
the economy is expanding, while a reading below 50% indicates
it is contracting. The April index was the first showing
above 50% since April 1989.
   After its release, some market players referred to the
NAPM report as the "napalm" report because "it blew the
market away," said F. Ward McCarthy Jr., a managing director
at Stone &amp; McCarthy Associates.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell as much as 1/2
point after the report was released, but it staged a partial
recovery later in the day and ended 3/8 point lower.
Investment-grade corporate bonds ended with moderate losses,
while municipal bonds were mixed. Junk bonds, which fell
sharply on Monday, were unchanged to moderately higher.
   In the mortgage-backed securities market, some bonds were
buoyed by unusually heavy issuance of real estate mortgage
investment conduits, which are created with mortgage
securities. Investment firms created five Remics yesterday
totaling more than $2.2 billion, one of the heaviest one-day
totals in the seven-year history of the market. And there was
talk that at least one more Remic would be issued today.
   In the Treasury market, analysts said prices also were
hurt by rising commodity prices, which fanned inflation
fears. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures
prices, which includes 21 commodities, rose more than 2 1/2
points in morning trading. The gains were trimmed later in
the day, and the CRB index ended 0.65 point higher at 246.46.
   On the economic calendar for release today is the March
index of leading economic indicators, last month's factory
orders and the latest edition of the Federal Reserve's "beige
book." The beige book is a summary of economic activity
prepared for use at the central bank's next Federal Open
Market Committee meeting.
   But the next most significant piece of economic news comes
Friday when the Labor Department releases the April
employment report. The data are expected to set the market
tone for next week's Treasury refunding, analysts and traders
say.
   The Treasury will unveil details of the quarterly auction
this afternoon. Most analysts expect a record-size refunding
package of between $30.5 billion to $31 billion, up from the
$30 billion in the previous refunding in February.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   After suffering a sizable setback Monday, the junk bond
market stabilized in brisk trading activity.
   "There's been a reasonable amount of activity across the
board," said David Feinman, a junk bond trader at Los
Angeles-based Jeffries &amp; Co. Even when prices were falling on
Monday, trading activity was far above normal. "The last two
days, we've been back in business."
   Among the market movers were junk bonds of Ames Department
Stores Inc., Trump Plaza Funding and American Standard Inc.
   Trump Plaza Funding's 12 7/8% bonds, which tumbled 3 1/2
points Monday, gained 1/2 to close at 82. The gains came in
spite of reports that robust business at Trump's Taj Mahal
casino appears to be hurting Trump Plaza and Trump Castle
casinos. Although the bonds would tend to trade lower on such
news, junk bond traders said dealers were snapping the
securities up because they have reached levels considered
relatively cheap. Ever since Friday's news that casino and
real estate developer Donald Trump may sell the Trump shuttle
and other major assets, some Trump casino bonds have fallen
nearly 10 points.
   Ames' 13% senior subordinated reset notes due in 1999,
jumped two points to end at 25 1/4. Active buying by vulture
funds and investment firms specializing in distressed
securities have buoyed Ames bonds ever since the retailer
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code last month.
   American Standard's 12 7/8% senior subordinated debentures
due in 2000, which shed a point Monday, were up 1/4 point at
94 1/4.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Heavy issuance of Remic offerings buoyed Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association
securities.
   The largest of the $2.2 billion of Remics offered
yesterday was a $750.1 million issue from Fannie Mae backed
by its 9 1/2% securities and underwritten by Bear, Stearns &amp;
Co., the leading underwriter in derivative mortgage-backed
securities this year.
   There were two large Remics backed by Government National
Mortgage Association securities, but those issues had been
rumored since late last week and had little market impact.
   In trading, Freddie Mac 9 1/2% securities finished at 95
30/32, down 1/32, and Fannie Mae 9 1/2% securities ended at
96 15/32, also down 1/32. But Ginnie Mae 9% securities for
May delivery ended at 93 11/32, down 8/32.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury, Agency Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 94 14/32 to yield
9.03%, compared with 94 26/32 to yield 8.989% on Monday. The
latest 10-year notes ended at 96 10/32 to yield 9.05%,
compared with 96 17/32 to yield 9.02%.
   Short-term interest rates rose. The discount rate on
three-month bills rose to 7.94% for a bond-equivalent yield
of 8.19%, while the rate on six-month bills rose to 8.04% for
a bond-equivalent yield of 8.48%.
   In the agency market, the Federal National Mortgage
Association priced a total of $1 billion of four-year and
10-year debentures. Fannie Mae said its $400 million offering
of debentures due May 10, 1994, was priced to yield 9.30%,
and its $600 million of debentures due May 10, 2000, was
priced to yield 9.80%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Actively traded municipal bonds were narrowly mixed in
late trading, with some issues off as much as 1/4 point while
others were up as much as 3/8 point.
   Short-covering aided issues at the start of the uninspired
session, but some municipals later weakened along with
Treasurys.
   In a short sale, investors sell borrowed stock and hope to
profit by later buying an equal number of shares at a lower
price to replace what was borrowed.
   With speculation about possible tightening by the Federal
Reserve continuing to grow, municipal bonds may weaken in the
near term if Treasurys keep slumping, market participants
said.
   Among new issues priced was $159.4 million of Minneapolis
Housing Redevelopment Authority health care system revenue
bonds priced by a Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. group.
   In secondary activity, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue of 2018 fell 1/4 point to 95 bid, to yield 7.61%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government bond market ended weaker as
bearish sentiment continued to grow.
   "People are adjusting their positions," said a dealer at a
Japanese securities firm. "Instead of holding long positions
{in this weak market}, it is better to hold short positions."
   Dealers noted, however, that trading activity has been
light because of the holiday-shortened week. Japan's
financial markets were closed Monday and will close again
tomorrow and Friday.
   Japan's 10-year bond fell 0.14 point to 85.69 to yield
7.435% yesterday.
   In Britain, bonds edged up on the latest quarterly survey
by the Confederation of British Industry, a trade
association.
   The poll of 1,232 firms found expectations that
manufacturing employment would fall despite a "slight
increase" in output in the next four months. It also
indicated that business confidence had declined further in
response to a drop in domestic demand and capacity
utilization.
   But activity was muted because of holidays in other
European countries. Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due
2003/2007 rose 3/8 to 94 1/2 to yield 12.53%.
   Markets in West Germany, France and several other European
countries were closed in observance of May Day.
