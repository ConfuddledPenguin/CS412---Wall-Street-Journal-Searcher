   BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Niagara Exchange Corp. said W.R. Berkley
Corp., Greenwich, Conn., purchased 970,000 shares of Niagara
preferred stock at $8.50 a share.
   The proceeds of $8.2 million will provide additional
capital to strengthen Niagara's balance sheet following heavy
losses from Hurricane Hugo.

   Niagara is the parent of Exchange Insurance Co. Berkley
also is involved in property casualty insurance.
   Under terms of the agreement, Berkley won't buy additional
Niagara Exchange shares during the next three years without
prior approval of the Niagara board, the company said.
   The preferred stock will have an 8 1/4% dividend rate,
payable quarterly in cash, or at the option of the Niagara
board, in additional shares, the company said. If regulatory
approvals are received for the voting rights, Berkley will
control 35% of the voting power of all Niagara Exchange
shares.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Niagara
common closed at $7, unchanged.
