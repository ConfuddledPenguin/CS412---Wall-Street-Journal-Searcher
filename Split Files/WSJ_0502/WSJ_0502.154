   NEW YORK -- The rise in interest rates this year has taken
its toll on utility stocks, which have given back gains made
in the past 12 months.
   The Dow Jones Utilities Average, which closed above 200
for the first time in May 1989, is now approaching that level
again -- but by heading lower rather than higher.

   Now some analysts, saying a turnaround in rates may be on
the horizon, think utility shares may be poised for a
recovery. "We've reached a pretty good buy point here," says
Edward J. Tirello, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
who notes he reiterated buy recommendations on 11 utility
stocks and recommended nine others last week.
   Utility stock prices have fallen further since the
recommendations were issued, but yesterday the average rose
1.01 to 204.10 even as the bond market declined modestly. Mr.
Tirello says he is confident that the worst is over for the
group. For prices to rise, however, "what we need to see is a
perception" that rates are going to head lower, he says.
   Utility stocks are often viewed as a substitute for
fixed-income investments because of their high dividend
yields. Higher rates make them less competitive with those
securities.
   The utilities average, composed of 15 issues, peaked Dec.
15 at an all-time high of 235.98 as Treasury bond yields
stood at their lowest level since March 1987. The benchmark
30-year bond yielded about 7.8% at the time.
   Since then, rates have been climbing. The yield on the
long-term Treasury bond, which ended last year at 7.97%, now
stands at 9.03%. As rates have fallen, the utilities average
has fallen commensurately -- down 13.16% this year, compared
with a 3.06% drop in the industrial average.
   "Utilities are clearly leading the way on the downside,"
says Chester Pado, director of technical research at
Jefferies &amp; Co., Los Angeles. Mr. Pado says the utilities
average could bottom out at from 193 to 195 if rates remain
at their current levels or move slightly higher, which he
considers "a safe bet."
   Barry Abramson, a utility analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, says his firm is projecting that yields on
long-term Treasury issues will decline to 8% by year-end.
"This would be a good time to buy utility stocks," he says.
   Similarly, Mr. Tirello of Shearson cites his firm's view
that rates "are starting to peak" as the reason for his
recommendations of utility issues last week. "I think the
prospects look pretty good" for the group, Mr. Tirello says,
especially for utilities that have excess generating
capacity, successful diversification or low-priced power. He
predicts that the Dow utilities average will "bounce up"
after testing the 200 level.
