   Echo Bay Mines Ltd. said it won't proceed with a
previously proposed plan to swap its stake in the Muscocho
Explorations Ltd. group of companies for a direct interest in
two Ontario gold mines.
   The decision, which follows an assessment of reserves and
ore grades at the mines, will result in a write-off of Echo
Bay's investment in the Muscocho group, for a first-quarter
charge of 42.4 million Canadian dollars (US$36.4 million), or
43 Canadian cents a share. Echo Bay, a large gold producer
with mines in Nevada and Canada's Northwest Territories,
hasn't yet reported first-quarter results for 1990.

   Under terms of the proposed transaction with Muscocho and
affiliates Flanagan McAdam Resources Inc. and McNellen
Resources Inc., Echo Bay, based in Edmonton, Alberta, planned
to exchange its shareholdings in the companies, plus C$10
million of cash and a C$10 million loan facility, for a 37.5%
direct stake in the Magnacon mine, and 50% of the Magino
mine.
