   FREMONT, Calif. -- Vitalink Communications Corp. said it
reduced the prices of three hardware products that connect
local area computer networks -- its TransLan III and TransLan
350 remote Ethernet bridges and its TransPATH 350 remote
Ethernet bridge-router.
   The company said the price cuts of about 15% were part of
a strategy to boost Vitalink's world-wide market share.
Vitalink said it also will offer increased discounts to
international distributors and resellers. Sales reached $70
million for the 12-month period ended March 31.
