   WASHINGTON -- The Air Transport Association, a U.S.
airline-industry group, announced it will pay as much as $1
million for information that helps authorities thwart
terrorism directed at airlines.
   The $1 million bounty will be used to supplement the State
Department's offer of as much as $2 million for such
information in cases of airline terrorism overseas. Unlike
the State Department's program, the ATA's offer will apply to
information related to domestic cases as well.

   "It was the unanimous judgment that the combined reward of
$3 million . . . is a meaningful amount in terms of providing
a deterrent, a disincentive or an encouragement to someone to
come forward with the information," said Robert Aaronson,
ATA's president. Twenty-three airlines will contribute money
to the reward pool.
   William Baker, assistant director of the
criminal-investigation division of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, said nearly 800 people have been murdered by
terrorist bombs on airlines.
