   CALGARY, Alberta -- State-owned Petro-Canada Inc., which
the Canadian government plans to privatize, reported 1989 net
income of 31 million Canadian dollars (US$26.6 million),
compared with a restated loss of C$43 million in 1988.
   Operating earnings were C$85 million, compared with a
restated 1988 operating loss of C$11 million.

   The integrated oil and gas concern said the improved
operating results reflect a rebound in its exploration and
production division, where it had a profit of C$80 million
last year, compared with a loss of C$89 million for 1988.
   Earnings from Petro-Canada's marketing and refining
division rose marginally, to C$104 million from C$102
million, it said, while losses from corporate activities
widened to C$99 million from C$24 million, mainly reflecting
higher interest costs.
   Petro-Canada said net in 1989 was affected by a special
charge of C$54 million, stemming from costs associated with
the layoff last year of 905 employees, reducing the company's
staff to about 6,500. In 1988, the company took an
extraordinary charge of C$22 million and paid preferred share
dividends of C$10 million.
   Revenue for 1989 wasn't immediately disclosed;
Petro-Canada had 1988 revenue of C$4.8 billion (US$4.12
billion).
   A change in Petro-Canada's accounting methods, which took
effect Jan. 1, 1989, also made it difficult to compare 1989
results with those of 1988, when the company initially
reported earnings of C$94 million, after special charges and
preferred share dividends totaling C$32 million.
