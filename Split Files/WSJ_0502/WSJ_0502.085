   General Computer Corp., Twinsburg, Ohio, said it reached a
proposed settlement of all claims between GCC and Revco D.S.
Inc., a drug-store chain operating under Chapter 11
provisions of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   General Computer said the settlement could have a
favorable impact on earnings for its May 31 fourth quarter,
but declined to estimate the amount.

   Under terms of the proposed settlement, General Computer
would pay $130,000 to Revco, but would receive about $450,000
from a disputed tax refund and accumulated interest on the
refund.
   The agreement also would eliminate a $575,000 promissory
note due Revco and receivables from Revco of $290,000.
   The settlement is subject to approval by the bankruptcy
court. General Computer provides computer systems and
services for pharmacies and medical offices.
