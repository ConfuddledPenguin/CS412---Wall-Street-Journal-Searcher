   NEW YORK -- The American Stock Exchange wants to list U.S.
stock-index warrants that would let investors bet on the
market's direction over the next three years.
   Long-term warrants are the closest thing to a popular new
product on Wall Street these days. In particular, put
warrants on Japan's Nikkei 225-stock index have attracted
wide trading interest among U.S. individuals and
institutions. Put warrants rise in value when an index
declines, and holders of Nikkei put warrants profited
handsomely on the Japanese stock market's recent plunge.

   So far, the only stock-index warrants traded in the U.S.
have been based on Japanese or British indexes. But subject
to Securities and Exchange Commission approval, the Amex
wants to start trading three-year warrants based on the
20-stock Major Market Index.
   The new Amex warrants would be underwritten by a Wall
Street firm or commercial bank. Amex Chairman James Jones
says Salomon Brothers Inc., Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., Bankers Trust Co. and PaineWebber Inc. have
all shown interest in rolling out the new warrants.
   Market professionals said the Amex may find some interest
in its warrants, but they added that it is entering a crowded
field. The Nikkei warrants achieved much of their popularity
because it was difficult for most U.S. investors to find any
other way of betting on a Japanese market decline.
   With the U.S. stock market, however, investors already
have several ways to bet long term on the market's direction.
Most Wall Street firms already make an over-the-counter
market in long-maturity stock-index warrants and options.
   In addition, most professional traders find they can
easily simulate a long-term warrant by trading in the
stock-index futures market and "rolling" their positions into
later-maturity contracts as existing contracts near their
expiration dates. And a two-year option on Standard &amp; Poor's
500-Stock Index, traded in the Chicago commodities markets,
has attracted little interest to date.
   Nonetheless, Amex officials seem willing to take their
chances. "Traditionally, the Amex has tried to be more
flexible and innovative about its new products," says Amex
President Ken Liebler. "Some of them are hits, and some
aren't. If they aren't hits, we move on."
