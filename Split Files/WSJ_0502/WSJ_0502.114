   A partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder said it is
seeking access to nonpublic financial and other information
about Pic `N' Save Corp., Dominguez, Calif., in connection
with the partnership's planned bid to acquire the company.
   Girard Partners Limited Partnership disclosed in a filing
that its representatives met with those of the retail chain
Saturday and that Pic 'N' Save indicated it is evaluating
"potential courses of action to enhance stockholder value."

   Pic `N' Save officials declined to comment on the meeting
or their plans for the company. Mr. Batchelder didn't return
calls to his office in La Jolla, Calif.
   At the meeting, Girard said it was willing to enter into
"appropriate confidentiality arrangements" to gain access to
the data, according to the filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Girard previously said it is soliciting proxies to gain a
majority of seats on Pic 'N' Save's board. In the latest
filing, Girard said it began its solicitation to remove five
directors. If elected, the Girard nominees plan to seek
acquisition proposals.
