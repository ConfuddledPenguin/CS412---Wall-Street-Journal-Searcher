   OIL CITY, Pa. -- Quaker State Corp., which primarily
produces lubricants, said it completed the sale of a small
refinery and a wax plant to the Petrowax PA Inc. unit of New
York-based U.S. Petroleum Corp. for $20 million in cash and a
$10 million note.
   Quaker State said that it recognized a $3.5 million pretax
profit on the sale of Petrowax, which specializes in making
and selling waxes, and that additional gains will be
recognized as the note is collected.
