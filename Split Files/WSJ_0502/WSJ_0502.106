   Speculative commodity funds dominated trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade, sending soybean futures prices
fluctuating wildly in a 31-cent range before they closed
modestly lower by day's end.
   "This was a pure and simple money game; there weren't any
fundamental reasons for the market move," said Daniel Basse,
director of marketing for AgResource Co. in Chicago.

   The funds started buying soybeans and soybean meal and oil
futures early in the session, traders said. With little
apparent selling interest on the floor, local traders
followed the funds and started buying as well. Soybeans for
July delivery soared to an intraday high of $6.715 a bushel
by midsession -- more than 10% higher than they were just two
weeks ago.
   Skyrocketing futures prices in Chicago didn't go unnoticed
on the farm. An increase in soybean sales by farmers reported
at grain elevators in several Midwestern states by late
morning may have helped tip the scales against the rally,
said Victor Lespinasse, a futures analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. on the Board of Trade.
   Farmers who waited until after lunch to sell their
soybeans might have wondered what all the excitement was
about.
   For whatever reason, the same funds and local traders that
had loaded up on soybean futures early in the session quickly
started dumping their contracts around noon, Chicago time.
Waves of sell orders swamped the Board of Trade soybean
trading pit, forcing July soybean futures to a daily low of
$6.405 a bushel before bouncing back a bit to close at $6.435
a bushel, down five cents a bushel for the day.
   Analysts said that at one point during the selling
stampede, some pit traders even started spreading false
rumors about export sales of soybean products to the Soviet
Union to try to stem the price slide.
   Excellent weather and moisture conditions across many
soybean planting regions in the U.S. suggest that futures
prices ought to go down as soybean plants come up, beginning
in a few weeks in many areas, analysts said. Indeed, one
rumor yesterday had forecasts for sharply lower soybean
prices being made tomorrow at a crop-outlook seminar being
sponsored by the Agriculture Department in Kansas City, Mo.
   Another factor that may weigh on soybean futures prices is
the relatively robust level of Brazilian soybean exports,
despite recent rains that have hampered that country's
soybean harvest. In addition, many Brazilian farmers may sell
soybeans this month to pay off government production loans
coming due in mid-May, said Mr. Basse.
   July wheat futures prices followed soybeans lower, closing
down four cents a bushel at $3.4175 a bushel. July corn
futures gained 1.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.8475 a
bushel.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose as traders were reluctant to
be caught short ahead of the meeting of the monitoring
committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, scheduled to begin today in Geneva. Oil ministers
scheduled an emergency meeting to try to find ways to prop up
the price of crude, which has fallen sharply over the past
month or more. The ministers are expected to discuss
production cuts as a means of reducing the world's oil glut.
West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery ended at
$18.81 a barrel, up 27 cents, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Gasoline and heating oil contracts also rose. After
trading ended on the Merc, the American Petroleum Institute
reported that crude oil inventories decreased slightly and
that gasoline stocks also fell. While the report would
normally be considered somewhat bullish, any news from the
OPEC meeting in Geneva will probably eclipse the American
Petroleum Institute in its importance to the market.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose sharply on buying triggered by
an unexpected drop in copper stocks and by options-related
activity in the London market. The July delivery was up 4.40
cents a pound to $1.1330, though it traded as high as $1.1450
before late profit-taking trimmed the advance. The London
Metal Exchange is now reporting copper inventories twice a
week, Tuesdays and Fridays, rather than only on Mondays. The
Metal Exchange yesterday reported that its stocks had fallen
7,525 tons to 55,150 tons, compared with general expectations
of a 3,000-to-4,000 ton increase. Traders who had bought
copper call options on the Metal Exchange decided to exercise
their right to buy futures contracts, said Fred Demler,
metals economist for PaineWebber, New York. As a result, he
said, traders who had sold the options contracts were forced
to buy futures and make delivery, which drove prices sharply
higher, Mr. Demler said. In the New York futures market, Mr.
Demler observed that the spot April contract on the Commodity
Exchange expired last Thursday at a strong price, amid
concern that there wouldn't be enough deliverable copper to
satisfy contracts outstanding. Since then, trading had turned
quiet and prices had eased. "Now the tightness of supplies is
exerting itself again" as a price-moving factor, he said. He
noted that U.S. consumption of copper during the first
quarter was up 3% from the year-earlier period, while global
deliveries of copper, which are an indication of use, were up
9% during January and February, compared with the same two
months of 1989, according to the American Bureau of Metal
Statistics, a private statistical organization. U.S. consumer
supplies are also low, Mr. Demler said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were higher, with silver
and platinum leading and gold lagging. July delivery silver
was up eight cents an ounce to $5.0950, while July platinum
ended with a gain of $5.60 an ounce at $479.70. June gold
advanced $1.30 an ounce to $372.70. Silver and platinum
traded in a wide range, while gold's fluctuations were
relatively narrow. July silver traded as high as $5.1300, and
July platinum hit a high of $485.50. According to one
analyst, gold showed less volatility because its price didn't
break through any technical barriers, unlike the situation in
both silver and platinum. Active buying of contracts was
triggered in silver when the July contract traded above $5.10
and in platinum when July rose above $480. A damping factor
in gold, as well, said the analyst, was that the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will hold
meetings over the weekend. The U.S. some time ago proposed
the sale by the IMF of some of its gold to make up for
defaults of some members, the analyst said. While the
proposal met strong negative reaction at first, a more
positive attitude has been growing recently, he said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices swung widely both above and below
Monday's close before ending slightly lower. The July
contract settled at 15.96 cents a pound for a loss of 0.06
cent a pound, but during the session it traded as high as
16.27 cents and as low as 15.72 cents. The market opened
easier and sank to its low of the day, said Judith Ganes,
analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., New York. Then, she said, it
shot up to the day's high before late profit-taking erased
the gains toward the close and dropped the price to a net
loss. There were no new developments and the market was
technically driven, said Ms. Ganes. She said the absence of
many European traders, who were observing May Day, could have
accounted for some of the volatility. One reason the futures
market was unable to retain its gains was that there has been
little demand for physical sugar in the world market, even
though supplies are tight, she said.
