   WASHINGTON -- The White House again expressed concern
about the rising cost of the savings-and-loan bailout and
said it is beginning the process of picking a new leader of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to handle it.
   "We certainly are concerned about additional costs, and it
seems clear there will be higher costs than originally
estimated," said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. "We
don't have agreement on how much they will be."

   The White House voiced similar concerns several weeks ago,
after Congress's General Accounting Office estimated that the
bailout's cost would be significantly higher than originally
estimated. Subsequently, President Bush met FDIC Chairman
William Seidman to discuss the price tag for the bailout. Mr.
Seidman also met privately last week with White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu, Bush administration aides said.
   Mr. Seidman has said he intends to leave his FDIC post
before his term expires next year, and Mr. Fitzwater
suggested that Mr. Bush hasn't tried to stop him from
leaving. The spokesman said that while a firm departure date
hasn't been set, the White House has begun internal
discussions about a successor for Mr. Seidman. Other
officials said it's likely to be several weeks before a firm
list of candidates is completed.
   Under last year's huge thrift-industry restructuring law,
the FDIC was given authority over the thrift
deposit-insurance fund and the Resolution Trust Corp., which
was created to merge and sell insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   Mr. Seidman has irritated Bush administration officials
with his outspoken assertions that the S&amp;L bailout probably
would be far more costly than the administration's official
estimate of $166 billion over 10 years. The FDIC chairman's
style has earned him plaudits among Democrats, though, and
some of them yesterday urged President Bush to ask him to
stay.
   Administration aides say the White House has begun
increasing its "focus" on the festering problem of failing
thrifts. White House aides largely delegated the matter to
the Treasury Department after the Bush administration
completed the S&amp;L legislation last August.
   Since then, though, it's become clear that the
administration's cost estimates for the bailout weren't
realistic. Last month, the GAO, Congress's investigative arm,
said the 10-year cost of the bailout likely will be roughly
$243 billion, not $166 billion as the administration
initially suggested. The GAO also said the cost over 30 years
should reach $325 billion, rather than the $257 billion that
the agency itself once estimated.
   White House officials say they don't have the time or
staff to oversee the thrift bailout, but they seem resigned
to devoting more attention to the problem in the next few
months.
   Mr. Seidman has said many times that he won't stay for his
entire term, and Mr. Fitzwater said the White House will be
looking for "new leadership there that will carry out an
aggressive program" when the chairman leaves.
   Mr. Seidman hasn't said precisely when he will be going,
but it seems that he will want to stay through the end of
June. By that time, the Resolution Trust Corp. hopes to have
sold 141 more ailing S&amp;Ls, which would represent a big
acceleration. Only about 60 have been sold so far.
   Separately, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) urged Mr.
Seidman to renegotiate some government-backed S&amp;L sales that
occurred nearly two years ago. Sen. Metzenbaum said that a
recently discovered memo indicates it would have been cheaper
to liquidate a group of five Texas thrifts, rather than sell
them to New York financier Ronald Perelman.
   In a February 1989 memorandum to the president of the Home
Loan Bank of Dallas, a lower-level regulator contended that
regulators overstated the cost of liquidation by $1.8 billion
at the time the deal was made in December 1988. "In my
opinion the {agency} has grossly overstated the liquidation
cost estimate," said the memo from regulatory analyst Jeff
Potter.
   The transaction has emerged as the most controversial of
nearly 100 government thrift sales struck in 1988. It
included about $5 billion in assistance to a newly created
thrift, First Gibraltar Bank, over 10 years, as well as
nearly $1 billion more in tax breaks for Mr. Perelman's
holding company, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Inc. Renegotiating the
deal could involve such things as paying off high-interest
government notes, to reduce the cost to taxpayers.
