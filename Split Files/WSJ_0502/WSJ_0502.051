   BOSTON -- Stride Rite Corp., which recently undertook its
first-time ever television advertising campaign, said it
expects its second-quarter earnings and sales to climb about
20%.
   These projections were disclosed at the Cambridge, Mass.,
shoe maker's annual meeting here.

   The company's chairman, Arnold Hiatt, said net income for
the quarter ended May 31, is expected to equal 59 cents a
share, up from 49 cents in the year-ago period. The year-ago
per-share figures reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in July
1989. Based on orders to be shipped in the next four weeks,
sales are projected to increase to about $146 million, up
from $122 million in last year's second quarter, Mr. Hiatt
said.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Stride Rite shares closed at $24.375, up $1.125.
   The projections triggered mixed reactions from analysts,
some of whom were pleasantly surprised.
   Barry Rothberg, an analyst for Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co., had
predicted that Stride Rite will earn about 56 cents and post
sales of about $141 million. Whether the company can maintain
the growth rate through the rest of the year remains to be
seen, he said, adding that he isn't yet upgrading his
year-end forecast of $2 a share.
   Some analysts, however, are projecting even higher
second-quarter earnings and sales, pointing out that the
company has a habit of underestimating its financial results.
   When the second-quarter numbers are posted, "earnings per
share could be a few cents higher and sales up by a few
million dollars," over yesterday's projections, said Steven
B. Frankel, an analyst for Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill Inc.
   Mr. Frankel explained that the children's division, which
has had lackluster sales, is gaining momentum. Stride Rite
recently added more jazzy colors and designs to both its
sneakers as well as its black patent-leather dress shoes,
which have been the mainstay in the line.
   Still, analysts note that Stride Rite rides on the
strength of its women's shoes, which make up about 50% of its
business.
   The shoes are featured in a new commercial airing this
spring. Results, so far, have been satisfactory, Mr. Hiatt
said. The commercial is part of what he called "an aggressive
advertising campaign" that is costing the company as much as
6% of sales, the most spent on promotions in its history.
   Mr. Hiatt said that while the company's performance, in
general, is meeting expectations, its retail stores have been
somewhat disappointing. Results at mall stores have to
improve or the company will close them, he said. The stores
were opened to serve as "a conduit for our products," he
said.
   Overall the company's retail-store division will still
lose money this year, though not as much as last year, Mr.
Hiatt projected. Expectations for next year are that the
division will break even, he added.
