   L. Gordon Crovitz's March 14 Rule of Law, "Absurd Punitive
Damages Also `Mock' Due Process," is on the mark. To take it
another step, since punitive damages are in the nature of a
fine for wrongdoing, why should the plaintiff be the
recipient? The victim of a criminal act does not receive the
money from the fine assessed against the felon. Prior to
assessing punitive damages, the legal process calculates and
awards actual damages. This should be enough for the
plaintiff. If the defendant acted outrageously in his
dealings with the plaintiff and by the judgment made him
whole with the award for damages, and if society desires to
punish him for his outrageous behavior, then the money so
raised should go to the same place that criminal fines go --
to the government.
   The attorney successfully pursuing a punitive-damages
award should be compensated for his efforts. The
court-awarded fee should be a reflection of time and effort
spent and not a percentage of the award. It should be
limited, however, to the award. The taxpayers should not be
digging in their pockets to compensate a losing effort.

   Mr. Crovitz's column misleads readers about the extent to
which corporations may claim due-process protections under
the Constitution.
   Mr. Crovitz would expand broadly the due-process clause to
have it strike down punitive-damage awards made against
"deep-pocketed corporations." But there is nothing in the
language or the legislative history of the due-process clause
that suggests it was designed to protect large corporations
from jury awards that compensate injured individuals.
   Mr. Crovitz would read into the due-process clause
protections for corporations because to do so would fit his
version of economic reality: that punitive damages are bad
for business.
   Unfortunately for Mr. Crovitz, the Supreme Court long ago
abandoned the idea that 19th-century laissez-faire economic
principles (like those espoused by Mr. Crovitz) should be
incorporated into the due-process clause.
   For Mr. Crovitz it is too late to turn back the clock to
an era of laissez faire. For corporations, punitive damages
will continue to serve as an important deterrent function.

   I wish Mr. Crovitz had carried his excellent article to
its ultimate logical conclusion: the total abolition of
punitive damages. They constitute a flagrant violation of the
principle that no punishments of any kind belong in a civil
case.
   But then, legal principles have long ago ceased to have
any meaning in our corrupt judicial system, except the one
that says: "The lawyers' pockets shall be filled."

   I much admire Mr. Crovitz's practical analysis of our
courts' problems with punitive damages. We can solve almost
all of them, avoiding much argument and legalistic
scholasticism, by forbidding the use of punitive damage
awards in the calculation of the plaintiff attorney's fee.
Since punitive damages are a punishment, applied for social
purposes, they should be paid only to the courts for their
maintenance and operations.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers also must be denied the enjoyment of
any part of the money juries award plaintiffs for pain and
suffering. Why should the defendant console the lawyer, who
didn't suffer?
