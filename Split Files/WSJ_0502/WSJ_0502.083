   TOKYO -- A year after authoring a new insider-trading law,
embarrassed Japanese stock-market regulators are watching
with their hands tied as police pursue the country's first
criminal insider-trading investigation.
   The regulators fear that the case, which centers on the
stock-trading activities of a woman and the former president
of Chiyoda Finance Co., makes the new insider-trading law
look toothless. Coming on the heels of Michael R. Milken's
admission of guilt to securities-law violations in Wall
Street's biggest criminal insider-trading case, the
difficulty that Japanese regulators have experienced in
pursuing their own investigation under the new law
particularly rankles some officials.

   "I wish we could have as much power as" the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, says an official at the
Finance Ministry, one of the agencies charged with
investigating improper share dealings. The SEC has a large
staff of investigators and lawyers who are empowered to
subpoena information and witnesses.
   By contrast, the Finance Ministry relies on informal, not
legal, influence and is short on staff: The number of
officials who conduct such inquiries soon will rise to 17
from seven at present. The ministry usually must rely on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's surveillance department to help.
   But both the ministry and the exchange came up
empty-handed when they began inquiries into the current case,
the first possible violation of last year's insider-trading
law. They lack the power to demand access to evidence or
compel witnesses to testify.
   As a result, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department --
acting on its own initiative -- took up the insider-trading
case and now appears close to beginning Japan's first
insider-trading prosecution. That turn of events is
embarrassing for market regulators, who pride themselves on
their close attention to the market and who last April
proudly implemented the legislation designed to make insider
trading illegal in Japan for the first time.
   A police spokesman confirmed that an investigation is
under way but would give no details. He declined to say how
the investigation was begun. No charges have been filed, he
said.
   However, Finance Ministry officials said, and Japanese
newspapers have reported, that the inquiry is focused on the
stock-market activities of a woman who the officials identify
as the girlfriend of a former president of Chiyoda, a small
Japanese finance company. The president, officials say, had
advance knowledge that a small Japanese company, Nisshin
Kisen Co., planned to issue new stock in order to fund the
purchase of a hotel in Australia. Nisshin Kisen is also known
as Nisshin Steamship Co., the English translation of the
Japanese name.
   The finance company's president -- who resigned March 31,
citing health reasons -- was told by Nisshin officials of
Nisshin's plans on June 8. Before the issue was announced,
the financier, apparently through his woman friend's account,
bought 7,000 shares in Nisshin, investigators believe. A day
before the stock issue was announced on June 16, Nisshin's
share price rose 160 yen ($1.01) to 2,210 yen, and its
trading volume more than tripled from average levels. Chiyoda
holds Nisshin Kisen shares.
   Nisshin Kisen confirmed that an investigation of the stock
trading is under way, but it declined any additional comment.
Chiyoda Finance declined comment on the case, although its
spokesman pointed out that the official under investigation
has resigned. The former president, meanwhile, could not be
contacted.
   The activity surrounding Nisshin's stock in advance of the
announcement prompted the Finance Ministry and the Tokyo
exchange to begin inquiries last June. But neither agency was
able to come up with anything to suggest that anyone had
relied on advance knowledge of the stock issue to make a
profit. The main reason for their failure, officials
complain, was their inability to demand assistance in their
inquiries from brokerage houses.
   "It would have been impossible" for the Finance Ministry
to know about any impropriety, because it lacks the legal
power to force clients to disclose the details of their
transactions, says Katsuzo Wakabayashi, a director in the
ministry's securities bureau. "We don't have the right to
search" for records as the Japanese police do, he says.
   The president of the stock exchange also bemoans the lack
of policing authority. "There is a limit in our investigating
ability," concedes Minoru Nagaoka, the president. But he says
the exchange can monitor trading and try to discourage
improper activity. "We want to exert more efforts to
strengthen our trading-screening function," he says.
   As a result, some officials complain that the
insider-trading law -- implemented last April at the height
of a national stock scandal that eventually felled the
government of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita -- has done
little to improve regulators' control over improper activity
in the markets.
   So far, though, nobody is calling for a revision of the
law. One Finance Ministry official says market regulators
simply will have to rely more on and cooperate more with the
police. "Of course we are willing to use them," he says.
