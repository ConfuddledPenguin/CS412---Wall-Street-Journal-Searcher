   WASHINGTON -- The North American subsidiary of Trusthouse
Forte PLC has agreed to buy the Watergate Hotel in
Washington, D.C. from the British Coal Board, a pension fund
that owns the 237-room luxury hotel. Terms of the purchase
aren't final, a Trusthouse Forte spokesman said.
   Trusthouse Forte, a British hotel and catering company,
said the hotel recently underwent a $13 million renovation,
and an additional $5 million improvement plan is scheduled.
Financing for the purchase will be arranged in Japan by Nikko
Securities Co. International.

   The purchase would include the hotel and health spa on
about an acre of land, and not the apartments and other
portions of the Watergate complex, the spokesman said.
Average room rates at the hotel range between $200 and $300 a
night.
   The Watergate lent its name to the 1972 break-in and
electronic bugging incident at the nearby headquarters of the
Democratic National Committee, which eventually culminated in
the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.
   The British Coal Board has sold off most of its U.S.
property portfolio, which it amassed over the past decade
when the real estate market was generally stronger.
