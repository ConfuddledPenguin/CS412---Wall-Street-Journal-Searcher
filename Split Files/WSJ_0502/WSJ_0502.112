   MCI Communications Corp., Washington, said it signed a
telephone-service contract valued at about $375 million over
five years, the largest contract in the company's history.
   MCI said it reached the agreement to provide long-distance
services with the Navy Resale and Service Support Office.
That office provides merchandise, food and personal services
for U.S. Navy families. The agreement covers calls from pay
phones at Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard sites throughout
the contiguous U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

   The contract is the latest MCI has won since a 1989
federal court order to open the pay-phone market to carriers
besides American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. MCI, which
recently won similar contracts with the city of Dallas and
Philadelphia International Airport, among others, estimates
total annual sales in the U.S. long-distance pay-phone market
at $2 billion.
   Subcontractors to MCI will be Bell Atlantic Corp. and a
unit of Pacific Telesis Group.
   In national over-the-counter trading, MCI closed at
$35.375, up 37.5 cents.
