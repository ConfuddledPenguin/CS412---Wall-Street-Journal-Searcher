   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee voted unanimously
behind closed doors to subpoena deposed junk-bond king
Michael Milken and to offer him immunity in return for his
testimony.
   A hearing before the House Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee could be held in the summer, probably before
Aug. 3, when the House is scheduled to begin its summer
recess, individuals close to the subcommittee said.

   Mr. Milken's testimony probably would be his first public
statements on the junk-bond market he created since he
pleaded guilty to six violations of federal securities law
and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and restitution. That
settlement allowed Mr. Milken to avoid trial on an earlier
98-count indictment that charged him with racketeering and
securities fraud. If Mr. Milken hadn't pleaded guilty,
prosecutors were expected to seek a broader indictment.
   A spokesman for Mr. Milken said last week that the
financier would testify if he received full immunity. The
spokesman declined to elaborate further and wouldn't say
whether Mr. Milken has any topics he is eager to discuss with
the subcommittee.
   Under the rules of so-called use immunity, nothing Mr.
Milken said at the hearing could be used against him in a
federal or state court. The subcommittee's action now goes to
the full Energy and Commerce Committee, which is expected to
agree to the subpoena and immunity. If the panel approves,
the issue will be open for comment by such agencies as the
Justice Department, which could object to the terms of the
subpoena.
   A Justice Department spokesman wouldn't say whether the
department would object to the accord.
   The subcommittee and full committee are headed by Chairman
John Dingell (D., Mich.), who is impatient to question Mr.
Milken about the 400 or so investment partnerships that
included Mr. Milken and other Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
employees.
   While no wrongdoing has been charged concerning those
partnerships, committee members argued at a hearing in 1988
-- at which Mr. Milken cited his Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination -- that the partnerships allowed
the employees to enrich themselves at the expense of
customers.
   Moreover, the panel wants to ask Mr. Milken about the role
of junk bonds in the savings-and-loan industry. The federal
government is currently bailing out hundreds of insolvent
thrifts in a program that will cost taxpayers several hundred
billion dollars. Some thrift executives also have been
convicted of fraud in their management of the institutions.
   Mr. Milken, who built much of his business selling junk
bonds to thrifts, is thought to hold the key to unlocking the
secrets of dealings by many thrifts.
   In an odd twist, the government also hopes to use the
hearing to learn about the junk-bond market. Mr. Milken was
by far the largest market-maker for the high-yield, high-risk
debt securities, and established himself and Drexel as the
buyer of last resort. Since his departure from the market
more than a year ago, pricing of junk bonds has become
increasingly tricky, with some issues frequently unavailable
for trading.
   Mr. Dingell has expressed concern in the past about the
lack of easy-to-find prices and volume data for junk bonds.
And recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission released
a report on junk bonds that was notable for how much the
agency didn't know about the market.
