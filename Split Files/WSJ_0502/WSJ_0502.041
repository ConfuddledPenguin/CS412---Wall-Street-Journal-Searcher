   Management:
   Women Managers Quit Not for Family
   But to Advance Their Corporate Climb

   Don't expect that a day-care center or a flexible schedule
will keep women managers from leaving corporations. They're
looking for a lot more than family benefits.
   That's the message from two new surveys, which say
managerial women who quit tend to do so not because of family
obligations, but because they feel blocked from advancement.
The studies also show that women are more willing than men to
throw corporate loyalty to the wind if they aren't getting
adequate opportunities for growth and job satisfaction.

   As a result, some management specialists warn that unless
companies begin accommodating women's desire for promotions
and respect, employers could risk increasing the already high
rate of turnover among female professionals. Right now, many
companies are merely emphasizing family issues, such as
maternity leave and day care, to attract and retain women.
   "While day care and family-oriented benefits are
important, they're not the reason women are leaving," says
Vicki Tashjian, vice president of Wick &amp; Co., a Wilmington,
Del., consulting firm. A recent study by Wick showed that of
110 male and female professionals from Fortune 500 companies
in the Northeast, 73% of the women who had left jobs quit to
work for other companies. Another 13% began their own
businesses and 7% were looking for new jobs. Only 7% left to
go home.
   "The reasons I left had nothing to do with family," says
Gloria Webster, who used to be a financial analyst for a
multinational chemical corporation. In her 14 years there,
Ms. Webster says, she won regular promotions, yet could never
break into management. Though she had supporters and good
training opportunities, she says she finally "hit what I felt
was my glass ceiling," feeling blocked as a woman by "people
who didn't want me to succeed in any way."
   Now, the 44-year-old mother of one is manager of corporate
communications for a commercial explosives business, where
employees "sink or swim on their own merits," she says. "It's
a challenge every day, and I thrive on it."
   A separate study by Opinion Research Corp., Princeton,
N.J., echoes the same sentiment. Data gathered on more than
26,500 male and female managers, supervisors and
professionals at seven big service and manufacturing
corporations revealed that women managers were more likely
than men to say they intend to leave their company within the
next year. Women also were more dissatisfied than men with
their career development. "Compared to male managers, female
managers perceive that they have fewer opportunities for
advancement and less chance of achieving their career
objectives in their organizations," the study concluded.
   Two-thirds of the women in the Wick study had children,
but when asked if there was anything going on in their
personal lives influencing their decisions to quit, women
mentioned children only 9% of the time. By contrast, men in
the study, 90% of whom had offspring, answered children 26%
of the time.
   "Women feel they do pay a pretty steep price" in either
choosing between family and career or balancing the two, says
Ms. Tashjian. Those who stick with their careers seem to feel
"they're just giving up too much not to be getting the
opportunity for work that's really meaningful," she says.
   That tolerance threshold seems lower with women than with
men. In the Wick study, 77% of the men said it was "highly
likely" they would remain with their company while just 35%
of the women said so. The study speculates that dissatisfied
men are more likely to hang on because they are trapped in
traditional notions about staying with one company.
   "Men still seem to have much more corporate loyalty," says
Ms. Tashjian, whereas "women are always thinking about
leaving," even if they are supporting families. She says the
"invisible hard choices" women must make usually rear up in a
woman's early to mid-30s, the "period of peril" when
dissatisfied women are most likely to leave a job.
   The Opinion Research survey showed that female managers
are more likely to have job turnover than male managers no
matter what their age. Even women over 40 -- a time when most
women are beyond childbearing years and have older, more
self-sufficient children -- are more likely to leave jobs
than their male counterparts.
   "If {women} were leaving because of small children, then
we'd see turnover drop among women over 40, we think. But we
don't see that," says Ellen M. Saxon, a research consultant
at Opinion Research. This study, too, found that men report
more conflict between work and family than women. "Women may
be leaving more due to the fact that they lack opportunity to
get ahead . . . rather than family and personal obligations,"
Ms. Saxon believes.
   Both sets of research challenge the wisdom of what some
derisively call a "mommy track" for women. The worlds of
business and women collided over this issue last year after
Felice Schwartz, president of Catalyst, a New York group that
specializes in women-in-business issues, argued in a Harvard
Business Review article that women cost more than men to
employ due to family-caused turnover and career interruptions
and so should be separated into "career primary" and "career
and family oriented" tracks to better retain and accommodate
both types.
   "Not one of the women in our study mentioned that she was
leaving to obtain better benefits such as maternity leave or
day-care assistance," says Wick's Ms. Tashjian. She goes so
far as to say corporate "fixation" on these family details
can detract from larger issues of women's advancement.
   Margaret Evans, a senior account director and board member
of BBDO, the New York advertising agency, says she has worked
there 11 years not because of any family benefits but because
she has been challenged by an array of interesting
assignments and rewarded with promotions. But the mother of
two toddlers says she would think "very seriously about
leaving" if she didn't enjoy her work.
   One company attempting to respond to professional women's
needs is Chubb &amp; Son Inc. At the Warren, N.J., insurer, women
have been half of entry-level professionals hired during the
past eight years. Though progress had been made, most of them
are still bunched up in the middle ranks with only a few
bursting out of the "pipeline" into more senior positions.
"Something is happening in that 10-to 12-year development
process where the playing field gets less level," says David
Fowler, Chubb's senior vice president and managing director,
who has worked with Wick to remedy that problem.
   One strategy, Mr. Fowler says, is holding managers
accountable for how they are advancing women and minorities
and publishing the results in quarterly "at-bat reports,"
which will affect bonuses. "Those branch managers who fill 30
jobs with white males bat zero, and those who fill a bunch
with women and minorities get hits," he says, adding that
financial incentive is "what will make people behave
differently."
   As for corporate America's poor track record in nurturing
women's advancement, Mr. Fowler blames a complex web of
reasons, including stereotyping by male managers who are more
comfortable working with other men, and a lack of
assertiveness by women on "managing the political process of
their career development." (In a recent survey by Catalyst,
79% of Fortune 500 chief executive officers conceded there
are identifiable barriers to women getting to the top.)
   If treatment of women managers continues as it is into the
1990s, Mr. Fowler says, women will become angry, some even
bringing legal action, and some will just plain quit. In the
end, he says, corporations will have "missed opportunities to
hire very talented ones."
