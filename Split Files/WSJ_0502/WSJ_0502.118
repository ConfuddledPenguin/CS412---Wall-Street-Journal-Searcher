   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan announced a major restructuring
aimed at strengthening its monetary operations and promoting
the monitoring of the activities of financial institutions at
home and abroad.
   The central bank's reorganization, which goes into effect
May 28, will reduce the number of its offices, departments
and institutes to 16 from 18.

   The bank said a Market Operations division will be
established to monitor both money and capital markets and to
execute daily monetary operations in a comprehensive manner.
A Bank Relations division and Capital Markets division will
oversee activities of financial institutions at home and
abroad.
   A Financial and Payment System Department will be
established to cope with the increased risks to the financial
system posed by the trends toward financial deregulation,
globalization and computerization, the bank said. And an
International Department will combine the functions of the
current Foreign Department with the overseas research
function of the current Research and Statistics Department.
   To expand the central bank's international network, the
representative office in Hong Kong will be made the Bank of
Japan's third chief representative office, for Asia and
Oceania, joining New York, for North and South America, and
London, for Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Another
representative office will be added to Washington, D.C.,
bringing the total number of offices to six.
