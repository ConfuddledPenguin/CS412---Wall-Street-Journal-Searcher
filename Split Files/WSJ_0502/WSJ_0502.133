   NEW YORK -- Gary Fisketjon, 35 years old, the editor known
for discovering Jay McInerney and other hip, young novelists,
was named to the new post of editor-at-large of Alfred A.
Knopf, a unit of Random House Inc.
   Mr. Fisketjon is leaving his post as editorial director of
Atlantic Monthly Press, a small, privately owned publisher.
He is expected to take a number of prominent authors with
him.

   Mr. Fisketjon actually started his publishing career at
Random House, a unit of the Newhouse family's Advance
Publications Inc., where he helped create an extremely
successful series of original paperback novels, Vintage
Contemporaries. An early title, a huge best seller, was Mr.
McInerney's "Bright Lights, Big City."
   About four years ago, Mr. Fisketjon left Random House for
Atlantic Monthly Press (taking Mr. McInerney with him), which
had just been bought by investor Carl Navarre, who is also
president and publisher. Since then, the publishing house has
built a reputation for quality fiction and nonfiction titles,
but is said to have been disappointed with its relative
dearth of bestsellers.
   Mr. Navarre declined to comment on earnings, but he said
Atlantic Monthly Press had its best sales ever in April and
is just starting to sell books through its own sales force.
"It's a blow that Gary's leaving because he's one of my best
friends," Mr. Navarre said. "And I wouldn't be surprised if
some authors went with him. But we've got a lot of other
editorial firepower here and there are a lot of things we do
that people aren't aware of, because Gary had such a high
profile."
