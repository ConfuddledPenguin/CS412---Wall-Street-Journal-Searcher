   Researchers reported that the controversial drug THA
provided no benefit to patients with Alzheimer's disease in a
controlled study conducted in Montreal.
   The study is the most recent in a series of contradictory
reports about the drug's usefulness in treating Alzheimer's
disease, a degenerative brain disorder that causes premature
senility. Warner-Lambert Co., which is conducting a large
test of THA in the U.S., last week said its own study shows
that about 40% of patients are responding positively to the
drug.

   Separately, two doctors writing in the Journal of the
American Medical Association warned that the costs of caring
for elderly people disabled by Alzheimer's, hip fractures and
other degenerative diseases will soar as the number of people
over 85 rises four to six times by 2040. The doctors, Edward
Schneider and Jack Guralnik, called for large increases in
research spending to cure, or delay the onset of,
debilitating diseases.
   According to some tests, THA has offered hope for helping
Alzheimer's patients. At its annual meeting last week,
Warner-Lambert said it plans to send its positive findings to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June and expects the
agency to approve the drug for sale in the U.S.
   The Canadian research, however, suggests that THA's impact
on Alzheimer's patients may be uncertain at best. Doctors at
the McGill Center for Studies in Aging found that 20 patients
given the drug fared about as well as 19 patients taking a
placebo in four different tests of their memory, mental
status, behavior and ability to function.
   The study, led by Serge Gauthier, is to be published in
tomorrow's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine and
its release to the public has been embargoed until tonight.
But copies of the report, and details of its negative
findings, began circulating on Wall Street late last week.
The Wall Street Journal obtained several copies of the report
from people who aren't constrained by the press embargo.
   At its annual meeting, Warner-Lambert confirmed the
existence of the report, its negative findings, and its
expected publication in the widely read medical journal when
a securities analyst asked Chairman Joseph Williams about it.
The analyst, James Keeney of Mabon Nugent, said that he heard
about the study in a chance conversation with a company
executive just before the annual meeting.
   Analysts linked the report to the decline in
Warner-Lambert's shares on Friday and Monday. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the Morris
Plains, N.J., health-care company's shares closed at
$105.375, up 25 cents. It had closed at $107.25 last
Thursday.
   The Canadian study's results are surprising because they
contradict a preliminary finding reported by Dr. Gauthier
last year. That report found that patients' families saw
heightened awareness and spontaneity among those given the
drug during a initial start-up test. But in the new report,
the researchers said the earlier benefit dissipated when the
drug's use was compared with a placebo over a four-week study
period.
   Warner-Lambert said its study is getting positive results
because it is testing the drug only in patients who have
shown some response to the drug. Dr. Gauthier's study didn't
test such an "enriched" population. Warner-Lambert said it
believes the drug, which it hopes to market under the name
Cognex, will benefit only a small portion of people with
Alzheimer's and that its study, which will study 300 people
when completed, is designed to test the drug in this
pre-selected group.
   Dr. Gauthier said he has stopped testing THA because side
effects forced him to use doses of the drug so low that its
effectiveness disappeared. In some patients, the drug
increased the level of kidney enzymes, an indication of
kidney damage. Warner-Lambert's study also uncovered this
problem, but the company said the problem is reversible when
the drug is discontinued and can be avoided by using very low
doses.
   Dr. Gauthier used 100 milligrams of the drug per day,
while Warner-Lambert is using 40 mg to 80 mg in its test.
   "There may be a group who will benefit from THA," Dr.
Gauthier said. "But they will be very hard to find."
   Writing separately in AMA journal, Dr. Schneider and Dr.
Guralnik said that the prevalence of dementia, which includes
Alzheimer's, rises sharply with age to 28% for people 85 and
above, from only 2.8% for those between the ages of 65 and
74.
   Speaking at a news conference called by the Alliance for
Aging Research, a consortium of medical and business
organizations pressing for more spending on programs to
attack diseases that afflict the aged, the doctors said that
only research breakthroughs can significantly limit the rise
in health care costs as the nation ages.
   "By investing $1 billion a year in research over the next
decade, we could cut the number afflicted by disabling
diseases in half or delay onset for five years and save more
than half a trillion dollars" per decade in the cost of
caring for the elderly, Dr. Schneider said. While THA has
shown a "minimally positive" impact, future generations of
drugs will offer more hope, he said.

   THE DRUG THA, being tested by Warner-Lambert Co. for
treating Alzheimer's disease, can cause an increase in liver
enzymes in some patients, a sign of liver damage. The
condition is reversible when the drug's use is stopped and
can be eliminated at low doses. Yesterday's edition
incorrectly said the drug affected kidney enzymes.
