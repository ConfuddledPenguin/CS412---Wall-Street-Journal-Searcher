   Forget the free trip. Consider instead a $25,000
full-length lynx coat or maybe a lawn mower.
   American Airlines yesterday announced a marketing program
in which its frequent fliers can cash in their mileage
credits for discounts and rebates on big-ticket items such as
cars, boats and computers. The airline, a unit of AMR Corp.,
says its research showed that travelers who use the airline
most often don't necessarily want another trip.

   Although the program is a consumer-oriented marketing
move, it's also an attempt to remove from the books what
could be billions of miles accumulated by its frequent
fliers. The airline, which created the frequent-flier concept
in 1981, has been almost too successful with it. Randy
Petersen, publisher of the travel newsletter Frequent,
estimates that American has a potential liability of 70
billion unused miles. Figures like that have forced airline
accountants to consider new ways to show the liability on
their balance sheets.
   American, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, won't say
how many unused miles its fliers have accumulated, although
it says it has 11 million members of AAdvantage, its
frequent-flier club.
   Industry executives say American's move is the most
far-reaching attempt by an airline to induce customers to
spend their frequent-flier points on something besides
airline seats.
   "American Airlines is the first airline to put it all
together in a package like this," Mr. Petersen says.
   American, like most of its rivals, still is reeling from
the triple mileage awards started by Delta Air Lines in 1988.
While the program was only a year long, so many fliers racked
up so many miles that airlines are resorting to unusual
methods to ensure that not all the fliers cash in the miles
at once. For example, Canadian Airlines trades bobsled rides
for points at the Canada Olympic Park in Calgary.
   Airlines limit use of the awards during busy travel days,
such as the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and keep a
tight rein on how many free seats they allocate per flight.
They also negotiate marketing agreements with other
industries. As part of this shift, American last year played
host to an auction in which several hundred of its best
customers bid frequent-flier points for promotional items
such as a tour package to this year's NCAA Final Four college
basketball championship and the use of a Cadillac from Avis
for a year.
   Some airlines don't see the need for such a program to
eliminate their excess mileage. Delta, for one, said it's
considered such programs in the past and opted against them.
"The most requested award we offer is the first-class
upgrade," a Delta spokesman says.
   Although it was the airlines that revolutionized the idea
of dangling freebies in front of regular customers, they are
one step behind the hotel industry in cataloging non-travel
promotions. ITT Sheraton Corp., a unit of ITT Corp., began
offering catalog merchandise in mid-1986 in conjunction with
their frequent-stay program. Among their current awards: a
pricey BMW 325i convertible.
   Holiday Inns Inc., a unit of London-based Bass PLC, gives
away items such an electric wok, a hedge trimmer, grandfather
clock and fax machine, in exchange for points.
   While the new trade-in program hardly costs American any
money -- Michael W. Gunn, American's senior vice president of
marketing, called it "a spit in the marketing budget" -- the
20 or so companies involved get access to some of American's
best-heeled fliers. Only two million of American's frequent
fliers will receive the glossy, 32-page color catalog filled
with pictures of computers, pianos, Cartier watches and
boats.
   Fliers can buy a product or service included in the
catalog, negotiating their own price, and then cash in a set
number of miles to get a further rebate. For example, after
buying a lynx coat, the frequent-flier member can cash in up
to 120,000 miles for a rebate ranging from $2,000 to $15,000.
The program also offers special savings on home health care
services or a commission reduction coupon for Quick &amp; Reilly,
a discount brokerage house.
   Mr. Gunn says that, so far at least, American's offer will
end after about a year. There are no plans now to extend this
program or come up with a new one, he says.
