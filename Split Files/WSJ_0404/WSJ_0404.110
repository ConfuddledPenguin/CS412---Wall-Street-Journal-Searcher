   NEW YORK -- General Motors Corp. still holds the title of
the nation's largest industrial company, and the top six
firms kept their rankings in Fortune magazine's latest 500
list.
   Philip Morris Cos. moved up to No. 7 from 10th place, and
Texaco Inc. fell to 10th from No. 8. Chrysler Corp. slipped
to eighth place from seventh. Rounding out the top 10 behind
GM were: Ford Motor Co., Exxon Corp., International Business
Machines Corp., General Electric Co., Mobil Corp., Philip
Morris, Chrysler, Du Pont Co. and Texaco.

   Fortune, which ranks the nation's largest industrial firms
by sales, said six of the 10 suffered double-digit earnings
declines, led by a 66% drop at Chrysler. The profit decline
comes after years of strong growth, Fortune said, and
reflects higher interest-rate payments and strong foreign
competition.
   GM led with $127 billion in sales and $4.2 billion in
earnings during 1989, despite foreign rivalries and a rebate
war among the Big Three auto makers.
   Fortune 500 sales jumped 7% to a record $2.16 trillion in
1989, but earnings fell 8.2% to $105.6 billion. During the
previous two years, profits among the big manufacturers
climbed an unprecedented 79%.
