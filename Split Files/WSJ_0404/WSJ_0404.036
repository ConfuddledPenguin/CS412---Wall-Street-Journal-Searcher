   TOKYO -- Sales of cars, trucks and buses in Japan rose
17.3% in the year ended March 31 to a record 5,844,482 units,
the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said.
   Sales of vehicles in March also reached a record for
monthly levels, climbing 15.5% to 788,882 units. Fiscal 1989
was the third consecutive year in which sales reached a
record level.

   A 3% consumption tax imposed at the beginning of the
fiscal year helped boost sales. While the tax was considered
a negative factor in some parts of the economy, it replaced a
higher commodity tax that applied to automobiles.
