   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- American Medical International
Inc. said that shareholders at its annual meeting approved
the hospital company's acquisition by IMA Holdings Corp. The
purchase is scheduled to be completed later this month.
   The move was expected as IMA Holdings, an investor group
including CS First Boston Group's First Boston Corp. and the
Pritzker family of Chicago, acquired 86% of American
Medical's 71.5 million common shares outstanding in a tender
offer late last year.
