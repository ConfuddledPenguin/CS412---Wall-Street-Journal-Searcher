   NEW YORK -- Investors chased stocks yesterday, especially
big consumer issues that aren't likely to deliver
first-quarter earnings surprises.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 36.26 to 2736.71.
Broader measures kept pace: Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
gained 4.94 to 343.64.

   Advancing issues topped decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange by 1,071 to 431. Big Board volume totaled
154,310,000 shares, the most since March 22; on Monday, just
124,360,000 shares traded.
   Investors are pursuing safety again, as they did for much
of the second half of 1989 when fears of a recession in the
U.S. increased. Big consumer stocks such as Philip Morris
helped pace the advance in the Dow industrials. Many money
managers are piling into big stocks that aren't expected to
have shocking first-quarter earnings news because they're
afraid market indexes may get ahead of them, one analyst
said.
   Additionally, foreign investors are turning back to the
U.S. stocks, which look less fragile than stocks in Tokyo and
some European nations, analysts said. According to one
trader, a major European institution has been buying large
amounts of U.S. stocks and index futures for the past two
days. Foreign investors typically prefer big U.S. issues that
have active markets and strong brand names.
   Philip Morris rose 1 3/8 to 40 7/8, and placed first on
the Big Board's list of most active issues with about 2.6
million shares changing hands. Coca-Cola rose 1 1/4 to 77
1/4; Procter &amp; Gamble gained 1 5/8 to 69 1/4, and Merck
advanced 1 1/4 to 71 5/8.
   Drug and food stocks were two other popular defensive
industry groups. Bristol-Myers Squibb advanced 1 1/4 to 54
1/2 on 1.5 million shares. Archer-Daniels-Midland gained 1
to 23 1/2 on 1.2 million shares.
   "There's more conviction about the earnings outlook for
{consumer stocks} than there is for the cyclicals," said
Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
Cyclical stocks are shares of companies whose fortunes swing
with the economy; cyclical industry groups were first-quarter
favorites.
   Two of the market's best-performing sectors through the
first quarter -- technology and energy -- also were at the
forefront of the its latest advance.
   Among technology issues, International Business Machines
gained 3/4 to 106 5/8 on 1.1 million shares, Digital
Equipment jumped 2 1/2 to 79 5/8, Compaq Computer climbed 1
7/8 to 99 1/2, Hewlett-Packard rose 1/2 to 46 3/4 and Unisys
rose 3/8 to 15 1/2.
   Exxon rose 7/8 to 47 1/8 on 1.1 million shares. Other oil
stocks also recorded solid gains; Chevron rose 7/8 to 67 7/8,
Texaco climbed 7/8 to 59 5/8, Mobil rose 7/8 to 62 1/2, Amoco
rose 7/8 to 54 1/8 and Royal Dutch Petroleum advanced 1 3/8
to 76 1/2. Oryx Energy rose 1 3/8 to 49; the company said it
made another oil discovery in its Pearsall field in south
Texas.
   But Unocal slid 1 5/8 to 32 on two million shares after
analysts at a number of brokerage houses made unfavorable
comments on the stock, which had been boosted recently by
takeover speculation. Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. lowered its
investment rating to "sell" from "hold," while Merrill Lynch
reduced its estimate of this year's earnings by 20 cents a
share, to $1.75.
   Issues of retailers rallied in advance of the release of
March sales reports from major chain stores, scheduled for
today. Woolworth advanced 3/4 to 63 1/2, Dayton Hudson gained
1 1/4 to 69 7/8, Gap Inc. climbed 1 7/8 to 68 3/8, Limited
Inc. rose 1 1/2 to 42 3/8, Mercantile Stores advanced 7/8 to
38 3/8 and Home Depot rose 1 1/8 to 46 7/8. Lowe's, which
reported that March sales were up 25% from a year earlier,
rose 7/8 to 33 1/2.
   Eastman Kodak advanced 1 1/2 to 40 1/2 as 1.6 million
shares changed hands. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. put the stock on
its research list, and rated the company "neutral." Bear
Stearns analyst Gary Schneider said he has concluded that
Kodak will "initiate some type of transaction" with its
Sterling Drug unit, with a sale "making the most sense." The
company declined comment.
   Georgia Gulf dropped 1/2 to 44 after NL Industries,
controlled by Dallas investor Harold Simmons, said it would
allow its $45-a-share bid for the company to expire and
support a planned recapitalization instead.
   Corning dropped 1/4 to 45 3/4 after reporting
first-quarter net income of 49 cents a share, above the
year-ago level but below analysts' expectations.
   Brazil Fund fell 1 1/8 to 9 1/2. The "Heard on the Street"
column yesterday in this newspaper reported that President
Fernando Collor de Mello has instituted sweeping measures
that have yanked the Brazilian economy to a halt, in an
effort to stop runaway inflation.
   Buckeye Partners dropped 1/2 to 25 and traded as low as 23
3/4. The partnership owns the pipeline from which about
75,000 gallons of petroleum products spilled into the
Allegheny River after a landslide near Pittsburgh last
Friday.
   Danaher jumped 2 1/4 to 17 3/4. Goldman Sachs and
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. put the stock on its research list with
"buy" recommendations and were positive on the company's
proposed acquisition of Easco Hand Tools in a stock swap.
   Golden Valley Microwave Foods gained 2 1/4 to 31 3/4. The
company and James River settled a patent-infringement dispute
over the packaging of microwave foods through a
cross-licensing agreement. James River rose 5/8 to 25 7/8.
   Textron advanced 7/8 to 23 3/8. The company said it plans
to buy back as many as five million common shares,
representing about 5.6% of its shares outstanding.
   Whitehall rose 5/8 to 17 1/2. Cambridge Capital Fund,
which has a stake of about 9.6% in the company, offered to
acquire the rest for $20 a share and said it plans a proxy
fight if Whitehall refuses to discuss the bid.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 2.28
to 361.65. Volume on the exchange totaled 14,710,000 shares.
There were 321 issues advancing and 231 issues declining.
   Entertainment Publishing rose 7/8 to 16 1/2. Goldman Sachs
put the stock on its research list with a "buy"
recommendation and said it expects nearly 40% earnings growth
in each of the next two years.
