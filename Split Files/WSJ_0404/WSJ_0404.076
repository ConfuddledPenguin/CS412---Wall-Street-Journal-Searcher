   NEW YORK -- Four directors at Businessland Inc. went on a
stock-buying spree in late January and February.
   Just days after the San Jose, Calif., computer retailer
reported a second-quarter operating loss, these corporate
insiders spent $2.9 million on Businessland shares, according
to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All
together, the filings show, they bought 408,000 shares at an
average price of $7.09 each.

   That turned out to be a savvy move. On March 7, the
company announced that it was making up with Compaq Computer
Corp. a year after a bitter feud drove a wedge between the
nation's biggest computer retailer and one of the largest
personal-computer makers.
   The announcement that Businessland would once again sell
Compaq computers boosted the price of its stock 23% in one
day, to $10.75. It was unchanged yesterday, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, at $10.875 a share.
   James Heisch, Businessland's senior vice president of
sales and services, said the directors were "obviously not"
aware of the company's pending sales agreement with Compaq at
the time they bought shares. They made their purchases, he
said, because "they felt the stock was very much
undervalued," and the company's fundamentals were "very
strong."
   Mr. Heisch said insiders are allowed to buy and sell
shares only during a 2 1/2-week window following the release
of earnings.
   Director Michael D. Kaufman made the largest insider
purchase, SEC filings show. He bought 382,000 shares for
about $2.6 million, bringing his total holdings to 826,961
shares. According to SEC filings, he started his buying on
Jan. 30, six days after the company reported a $1.2 million
second-quarter loss.
   The other three Businessland directors each more than
doubled their holdings with purchases of 1,000 to 15,000
shares, made from Feb. 1 through Feb. 15.
   Mr. Kaufman, president of MK Global Ventures, a
money-management concern based in Palo Alto, Calif., said he
bought the shares for his firm's investment portfolios. "We
were buyers without Compaq and, if Compaq decided to
disenfranchise us again, we would still be a buyer."
   Mr. Kaufman says he's betting on Businessland because of
its efforts to expand its service and support network
internationally. A company "that can service a variety of
different {computer brands} anywhere in the world and give
you the `warm fuzzies' you need to run your business" is
going to prosper, he says.
   Analysts, too, are generally bullish on Businessland.
Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Michelle Preston predicts that, with
the company's price-cutting battles behind it, the stock will
outperform the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. "We're
still pretty optimistic about growth in PC sales," she said,
and Businessland's "economies of scale" should allow it to
increase its market share.

   DISK-DRIVEN SALES: Strong insider activity at another
computer firm, Quantum Corp., a Milpitas, Calif., maker of
disk drives, wasn't quite as well-timed.
   As shown on the accompanying Insider Trading Spotlight,
four insiders sold a total of 153,893 shares in February, SEC
filings show (see accompanying table -- WSJ April 4, 1990).
Quantum's chairman, Stephen Berkley, sold 100,000 of those
shares, or 36% of his stake in the company, according to the
filings.
   The insiders sold at prices ranging from $10 to $11.63 a
share. But the stock has since rallied, in over-the-counter
trading, to close yesterday at $14.125, up 75 cents.
   Company officials, including Mr. Berkley, declined to
comment on the sales.

   TORCH BEARERS: Seven executives at Torchmark Corp., a
Birmingham, Ala., insurer, purchased more than 1.2 million of
its shares through the exercise of below-market-price stock
options at the end of last year, SEC filings show.
   Torchmark Chairman Ronald K. Richey more than doubled his
holdings in the company, boosting his current stake to
491,658 shares from 237,804 shares, according to the company.
(He turned 91,647 shares back to the company Jan. 30 to pay
taxes on the options exercises.)
   The insiders paid $10.88 to $30.50 a share; the stock was
unchanged at $45.50 a share in Big Board composite trading
yesterday.
   Mr. Richey, along with most of Torchmark's other senior
officials, was out of the office yesterday and couldn't be
reached for comment. A Torchmark spokeswoman said they were
arranging the company's efforts to propose its five nominees
to the board of American General Corp., a Houston-based
insurer. Torchmark made a $6.3 billion bid for American
General on March 26, but said it withdrew it after American
General failed to respond within 48 hours.
