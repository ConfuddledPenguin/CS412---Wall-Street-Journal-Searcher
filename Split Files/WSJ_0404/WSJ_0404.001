   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa -- The flames from two
paraffin lamps cast more shadows than light across nearly 100
residents of a black township packed into a one-room shack.
The community meeting in a shantytown closes with a chant of
defiance.
   "Amandla] {Power]} An injury to one is an injury to all.
Amandla]" As the people do the toyi-toyi dance, they sing,
"De Klerk's government is going to fall."

   Like most blacks in South Africa, the residents of this
so-called Soweto by the Sea, a township of makeshift housing
within Port Elizabeth, are jubilant over President F.W. de
Klerk's stunning "unbanning" of the revolutionary African
National Congress and release of ANC leader Nelson Mandela
after 27 years in prison. "Everything is going to be
changed," exults Ndzimeici Stefaans Pangiso, a 72-year-old
man with a gray goatee who joined the ANC 40 years ago.
   Many of South Africa's poorest of the poor here are
organizing for what they believe will be a hard struggle for
democracy. Sowetans don't credit the white government for the
historic changes. They see the changes as victories in a
continuing struggle by blacks victimized by apartheid. The
highly politicized shack-dwellers still regard Pretoria as
the enemy. "I am waiting for the last kick of the
government," says Bob Gaga, a laborer here.
   Recent events, however, demonstrate that the government
still has plenty of kick left. Mr. Mandela has postponed
talks with the Pretoria regime that were scheduled to begin
next Wednesday, after police in the black township of
Sebokeng near Johannesburg last month killed about a dozen
demonstrators and injured more than 400 people protesting
high rents. President de Klerk this week sent more police and
military personnel to Natal Province to quell violence there.
   This Soweto isn't the one outside Johannesburg that Mr.
Mandela returned to after his release. Urban planners call
this place an "informal settlement," even though it has as
many as 100,000 residents. It is characteristic of the black
townships across South Africa.
   To a reporter who was here for a month in 1986, just
before the government declared a state of emergency that
further restricted the rights of blacks, the change is
striking. In 1986, anyone who spoke against the government
was subject to arrest. Residents were continually harassed by
soldiers, many in menacing vehicles called hippos that roamed
the dirt streets, sometimes knocking down dwellings. There
was violence by blacks against blacks, as well. People
suspected as informers for the government were "necklaced" --
a tire drenched in gasoline was hung around their necks and
set afire.
   Because of their strong political organization, the Port
Elizabeth townships have escaped the factional fighting that
continues to plague the Natal province. "The Port Elizabeth
black community is a very close-knit community, with very
strong leadership," says Roger Matlock, regional director of
the Urban Foundation, which made a recent study of the
township.
   Today, the people of this Soweto can call for toppling the
government with little fear of persecution, though detention
without trial still is permitted under the continuing state
of emergency. They chant "Viva Mandela] Viva ANC]" and they
are not arrested. The brave few who once defied authorities
by wearing the black, green and gold colors of the ANC now
have been joined by the many. T-shirts with Mr. Mandela's
picture on them are everywhere. Nearly everyone who spoke to
this reporter in 1986 requested anonymity; this time, no one
did.
   Local violence has receded. And the hippos have
disappeared. Gladys Dumani says she no longer worries that
her shanty will be crushed in the middle of the night. "I'm
feeling much better," she says. "I stayed in fear before
because, when I hear a hippo, I feared it would knock my
house down whilst I am sleeping."
   A few residents have even improved economically. Isaac
"Spider" Gojela, a political organizer who was released from
jail a year ago, has moved with his wife to nearby
Motherwell, a new community designed in part to relieve
dangerous overcrowding here.
   But upward mobility in these parts is measured in tiny
steps. In Motherwell, Mr. Gojela, 35, lives in a cinder-block
house instead of a Soweto shanty. He moved up, he says, from
"a shack to a shed."
   Soweto is horrendously poor, neglected and not even on the
Port Elizabeth street map. Shoeless children in ragged
clothes practice soccer with a tennis ball. Weary,
beaten-down old men limp along the road, making way for
groups of youths with fire in their eyes. Hogs pick garbage
from the muck near the open market. Dwellings have no
plumbing. Streets aren't paved; there are no sewers and no
telephones. Life expectancy is low. Whites outlive blacks on
the average by 15 years. And unemployment is high, about 60%.
   Looking down the street at 9:30 at night, one sees no
porch lights, no lights inside the shacks, no faint blue glow
from a TV set. Indeed, there is no electricity. Tall polls
stand perhaps 200 yards apart from which lights once
illuminated broad areas. But they were put out years ago by
youths seeking to make night patrols by the police and army
more difficult.
   The patrols for the most part are gone now, but the
atmosphere is still tense; black goals remain unachieved.
Sowetans have been encouraged by Mr. de Klerk's talk of
liberalization, but they are painfully aware that apartheid
remains in place.
   The people of Soweto, an ANC stronghold, are organizing to
press for majority rule: a one-person, one-vote democracy in
a unified state with unified cities and towns. "We are in a
hurry of seeing the new election of the people which would
not have the discrimination of the people," says Bernston
Mdyogolo, a 54-year-old fruit vendor in Soweto's square. "We
would like to see things change very fast."
   To keep pressure on the South African government, many
Sowetans favor continuing economic sanctions by the U.S. and
other countries. Sowetans believe the sanctions have played
an important role in bringing about the positive changes that
have taken place so far.
   "We are appealing to the Western countries to take the key
of sanctions and throw it to the sea as long as apartheid is
still existing in this country," says Wellington May, the
nearly toothless chairman of Soweto's Area C community group.
Mr. May, who once sold imported diesel parts, favors
sanctions even if their effect has been to keep him
unemployed for two years. "It is not the point that it makes
us to be unemployed. We want freedom. After that, sanctions
can be lifted."
   Nobody expects white Afrikaners to give up power easily,
however. Apartheid sought to eliminate black citizenship in
South Africa by assigning blacks arbitrarily to citizenship
in tribal-based homelands, or Bantustans, without regard to
whether they had ever lived there. Other blacks are forced to
live in certain "townships" or "locations," which in essence
are labor camps for blacks with jobs in the nearby white
sections. Ibhayi is the government's name for Soweto and
other townships around Port Elizabeth. Each township, as town
clerk Flip Alberts concedes, is "not a self-contained city.
It's a dormitory town."
   These sections have separate township councils that, like
the Bantustans, are integral parts of apartheid. The council
members, whose elections are boycotted by the the mass of
blacks, say they use the system to work for the aspirations
of fellow blacks. "It is a fact we are in the apartheid
grid," says council member S.A. Mpondo. "But we feel we have
to fight {from} within to get what we want."
   Officials are still considered system stooges. But their
homes no longer are burned, their lives no longer are
threatened by militants. Mr. Alberts, a hired city
administrator, proudly says, "Politically inspired
destructive activity is virtually nonexistent." But the cry
in Soweto for "one city, one municipality" calls for the
incorporation of the townships into Port Elizabeth.
   The strongest support for international sanctions and
other actions against apartheid is found among the neediest.
The front room of Mr. May's house has a dirt floor. Five
children sleep in one room, three boys in a double bed, two
girls in a twin. With very little furniture, the place is
bleak. Many Americans have garages that are more imposing. "I
am trying to teach my children to live hygienically," says
Mr. May, a priest in the African-Catholic Church. "I am
trying not to let the apartheid oppress me. I'm trying to
pull myself up. I'm trying."
   Living hygienically in Soweto is harder now than it was
four years ago. It always was difficult. Without a proper
drainage system, stagnant water collects in pools. The annual
population growth rate in Soweto, said to be in the range of
6.9% to 8%, makes the place ever more crowded. The pigs
recently introduced to the community add to the filth.
   Overcrowding extends from the shacks to the schools. At a
primary school called Mzisiswano, 77% of the children are
from Soweto. Each class has at least 60 pupils. Attendance is
very good among children enrolled, but about 40% of Soweto's
children don't ever go to school. Classrooms are ill-equipped
and in need of repairs.
   The most urgent local concern for shack-dwellers is decent
housing. Residents go to great lengths to maintain their
pride, while living in places unfit for human habitation:
Some shanties have china cabinets with glasses, cups and
saucers neatly arrayed. People sweep the dry earth outside
their homes.
   No matter how hard they work to make a shack a home, it is
still a shack. "Enough is enough," says Thoko Nomkonwana, who
calls Soweto Shackville. "We want houses. We want employment.
Sooner not later."
   A few hope to regain property they once owned. Gertrude
Majola, a 61-year-old nurse, lives in one of the few
substantial buildings in Soweto. Her late husband, a teacher,
bought the property in the late 1950s. But nearly 20 years
later, the Bantu administration board made them relinquish
title to their house, a store and sufficient land to
accommodate a hundred shacks. "They said, `No, no, Africans
cannot own land,'" she recalls. "So they made us sell it."
   Since then, she has been a tenant on what had been her
family's land. Mrs. Majola says the Ibhayi city council might
now sell it back to her.
   A new openness exists among South African blacks. Brian
Sokutu, the Port Elizabeth correspondent for the New Nation,
was among many black journalists jailed without trial, even
without charges filed against them. His newspaper was shut
down temporarily. He recalls having to conceal liberation
literature, which he dared not keep at home. "I would have to
go at night and fetch it . . .," he says. "But after the
unbanning, now people can just put their literature on top of
their desk and read it anywhere," he says. "It's quite
exciting."
   To try to achieve democracy, the Sowetans are rebuilding
political organizations that were struck down by the state of
emergency and by the arrests of many local leaders. Because
the ANC was illegal, an umbrella black group called the
United Democratic Front basically served as its above-ground
operation. But it was effectively outlawed, too, as were
affiliated groups. Leaders went about in disguises and tried
to evade the police. But nearly all of the black political
leaders of Soweto by the Sea were captured and imprisoned
without trial for as long as three years. And when they were
released, restrictions amounting to house arrest made any
protest a criminal act.
   Because the street and area committees that had promoted
politics and controlled crime were illegal, groups called
"anticrime committees" were formed to deal with an upsurge in
robberies and violence. They succeeded in making the streets
safe. Now "you can go day and night even if you are young or
old," says Samuel Ngcume, who hobbles along the dirt roads on
crutches.
   Reviving Soweto's political organization is time-consuming
work, what with all the meetings and rallies. Activists'
enthusiasm got a big boost when Mr. Mandela held a huge rally
near Port Elizabeth last Sunday. Mr. Gojela, who organizes in
both Soweto and Motherwell and who was vice chairman of the
area committee before he went to jail for nearly three years,
says it is important for leaders to rekindle the community's
fighting spirit. He is optimistic. "It won't take long," he
says.
   "The signs are there that our liberation is coming, but at
this stage nobody can tell how far is it, which means unity
and discipline are very much important," Mr. Gojela adds.
"Unity, in particular, because at any time we might see
ourselves have a vote."
   Liberation isn't imminent, however, longtime activists
caution. "Sometimes I get worried" {because} the expectations
are too high," says Raymond Mhlaba, who was one of the ANC
officials released after 26 years in prison, a few months
before Mr. Mandela was freed. He is concerned about "the
belief that we are on the verge of winning. That might not be
so. It might take us five years."
   For residents of this place, a better life can't come too
soon. "I'm waiting for the pleasure of my life," says Papisi
Alfred Wilson Kondile, who is in his 70s.
   His hands shake, his beard is scraggly. He wears a red,
white and gray knit hat and two brown sweaters over his
shirt. There are no laces in his shoes. A bucket catches
rainwater dripping into the small room from the sagging tin
roof of his shack. He and his wife have little food. "We live
in a terrible situation," the old man says. "Maybe things can
get better. You see how much we suffer."
