   WASHINGTON -- Japan has agreed to allow U.S.
communications satellite vendors to bid for orders from both
public agencies and from its largest telecommunications
company, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp., a Japanese
Foreign Ministry spokesman said here.
   The spokesman, Makoto Yamanaka, said Japan has agreed to
conduct the bidding in an "open, transparent and
nondiscriminatory" manner. U.S. officials acknowledged that
such an understanding had been reached, but didn't provide
details.

   The agreement in principle brought the two governments
close to settling the second of three trade disputes raised
under the so-called Super 301 provision of the U.S. trade
law. Earlier, the two sides agreed on the conditions through
which the U.S. can sell supercomputers to Japanese public
agencies. The Super 301 statute authorizes the U.S. to slap
stiff trade sanctions on countries that don't meet its
requirements.
   The prospective satellite accord makes a distinction
between research satellites, which Tokyo has the right to
independently develop, and commercial satellites, which it is
required to procure from the most competitive sources. Such
an accord would allow Japan's National Aeronautics and Space
Development Agency to develop its projected research
satellites on its own. However, satellites that Japan
acquires for broadcast, weather-monitoring and other
commercial functions would be subject to open bidding.
   Other Japanese officials said the accord eventually will
lead to the purchase of a U.S.-made satellite by NHK, Japan's
public broadcasting corporation.
   The accord, however, takes Japan's separate CS4 satellite
project out of the reach of U.S. vendors because it will be
converted into a purely government-financed research project.
The U.S. earlier protested that the project had commercial
implications because of NTT's participation in it. The accord
will remove NTT from working on the CS4 satellite.
   Mr. Yamanaka said the satellite accord still has to be
formalized by an exchange of letters between the two
governments.
   U.S. and Japanese officials are still negotiating a
settlement of the third dispute, a U.S. complaint that Japan
unfairly restricts imports of forest products.
