   WASHINGTON -- A National Academy of Sciences panel
generally backed a Bush administration plan to spend
approximately $50 billion over 25 years on a series of huge
satellites to study climates, but said it is just as
important to launch smaller satellites, too.
   The administration plan, called "Mission to Planet Earth,"
envisions launching two $3 billion satellites near the end of
the decade to study the changing global environment. Each of
the satellites, called the Earth Observing System, or EOS,
would be replaced every five years to get a 15-year
environmental record of Earth.

   But EOS critics, who include some of the leading climate
researchers, say the satellites are too expensive, too
complex and too risky. If an EOS satellite should fail during
launch or operation, they say, it could devastate climate
research because so many instruments are concentrated on a
single platform.
   The academy report gave fresh ammunition to the critics.
James Baker, an oceanographer who was chairman of the panel,
said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should
launch small satellites in addition to EOS -- even if it
means taking money from the EOS budget and delaying EOS
launches. These smaller satellites are needed to continue
current observations of the Earth or to add capabilities
missing in EOS, he said.
   "We can't wait for EOS" to get those measurements, said
Mr. Baker.
   NASA, in a nod to its critics, so far has backed four
small satellites to study atmospheric ozone, ocean plant
life, sea winds and tropical rainfall before the EOS
launches. Mr. Baker said NASA's top priority should be to
make sure those satellites, called Earth Probes, are
launched. Then the agency should examine adding satellites to
measure the Earth's magnetic field, gravity field, cloud
coverage and soil moisture, he said.
   For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, NASA has requested
$235 million for the EOS program and $25 million for the
smaller satellites. Mr. Baker said NASA should consider
shifting money from EOS to the Earth Probes to advance the
launch dates of the smaller satellites.
   NASA officials oppose shifting money from EOS, and say the
huge satellites are their first priority.
   The EOS satellites will pass the same points on Earth at
the same time every day, measuring the interplay of the
atmosphere, land and ocean. Getting simultaneous readings of
different climatic data would be a big advance, NASA says,
because it would give researchers a way to understand the
climate as a whole.
   The academy report said it made sense to package the first
EOS, which measures the interaction of the Earth surface and
atmosphere, as a single big satellite. But it said the work
of the second EOS could be divided into smaller satellites.
The orbits of smaller satellites can be geared to getting the
best data from the few instruments that each carried on
board, the report said. The EOS must pick a compromise orbit
to satisfy the dozen or so instruments that must work
together.
   The 14-member panel consisted mainly of atmospheric and
space scientists who work at universities.
