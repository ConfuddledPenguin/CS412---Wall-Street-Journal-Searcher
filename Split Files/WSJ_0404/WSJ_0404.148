   Central Banking System Inc.'s 1989 net loss won't impair
its plan to liquidate and sell its banking unit.
   The Walnut Creek, Calif., bank holding company's loss
narrowed to $29.7 million, or $6.95 a share, from $42.2
million, or $9.87 a share, in 1988.

   The fourth-quarter loss narrowed to $1.8 million, or 42
cents a share, from $24.9 million, or $5.83 a share, a year
earlier. The full-year and quarter losses don't include the
fourth-quarter losses at the Central Bank and CB Insurance
Agency Inc. units, which totaled $3.4 million; the losses are
treated separately as assets for sale.
   Central Banking still meets the financial criteria of its
pact to sell the two units to Bank of the West, a San
Francisco unit of France's state-owned Banque Nationale de
Paris, for $42.8 million. The sale should take place in late
spring, Central Banking said.
   Central Banking has been plagued by losses; an audit in
September uncovered $2.3 million in overstated gains, mostly
from auto loans.
