   Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc. and James River Corp.
settled litigation over patent rights to packaging for
popcorn and other microwaveable foods.
   Under the accord, each company will pay the other
royalties. Because payments are expected to be largely
offsetting, neither concern anticipates any significant
financial impact from the settlement.

   James River, a Richmond, Va., paper and plastic products
concern, agreed to pay Golden Valley royalties on sales of
popcorn bags but will receive a royalty-free license to other
food packaging.
   Golden Valley will pay royalties on products except for
popcorn and french-fry packaging. Golden Valley, of Edina,
Minn., retains exclusive patent rights on its honeycomb
french-fry container.
   Both companies hold patents for susceptor heat strips used
in microwaveable-food packaging. James River sued Golden
Valley in 1986 alleging that the food company had infringed
on its packaging patents.
