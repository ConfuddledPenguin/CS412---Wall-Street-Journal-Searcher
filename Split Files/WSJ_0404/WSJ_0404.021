   A rebounding Tokyo stock market and rounds of buy programs
pushed U.S. stocks sharply higher, while the bond and
currency markets idled along with modest changes.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 36.26 points to
2736.71.

   Bond investors bid prices of long-term Treasury bonds
modestly higher. The dollar rose against the yen, but fell
slightly against the mark.
   The Tokyo stock market's rebound from its second-worst
plunge ever helped boost confidence among U.S. investors. The
Nikkei Index of 225 stocks rose 757.65, or 2.7%, to 28759.72
Tuesday despite selling by many individual investors forced
to put up more money for stocks they bought on credit.
Demands for more cash came after the Nikkei plummeted 6.6%
Monday.
   More important, however, was the U.S. stock market's
ability to weather that Tokyo nose dive. The ability of U.S.
investors to shake off concerns about Tokyo stocks is leading
some analysts to conclude that the U.S. stock market is
healthy and headed toward new highs. With yesterday's gain,
the industrial average is within 74 points of the Jan. 2
record of 2810.15.
   But others contend that light volume and program-trading
activity is distorting price moves in the U.S. market and
that any budding investor confidence is likely to be
shattered as disappointing first-quarter earnings reports
begin flowing.
   The modest rise in bond prices came in sluggish trading as
investors and traders hunkered down to await today's
announcements regarding the Treasury's plans for auctions of
seven-year notes and 40-year bonds Resolution Funding Corp.
Traders are particularly concerned about the market's ability
to absorb another round of 40-year Refco bonds. The first
auction of $5 billion of those bonds in January sent
long-term bond prices plunging. But traders suggest that the
next auction will be of only $4 billion, which would relieve
some of the pressure on long-term bond prices.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices soared in moderate trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 154.3 million shares. Advancing
issues on the Big Board were ahead of losers 1,071 to 431.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue
gained nearly a quarter of a point, or about $2.50 for each
$1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue slipped to
8.61%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late afternoon New York trading
the dollar was at 1.6979 marks and 159.79 yen compared with
1.7009 marks and 158.95 yen Monday.
