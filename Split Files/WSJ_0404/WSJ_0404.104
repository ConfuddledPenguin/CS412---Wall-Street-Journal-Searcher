   Denver -- As a card-carrying Young Republican, Greg
Anthony believes in taking advantage of his opportunities. He
also believes that this option should be open to all in the
Land of the Free.
   "If we give our opponents the opportunity to lose their
composure, sometimes they will," said the swift U. of
Nevada-Las Vegas point guard at a press conference
preliminary to his team's Terminal Two NCAA college
basketball match with Duke. "Good things happen to us when
other people get shook up."

   On Monday night, in McNichols Arena here, the
light-footed, light-fingered Runnin' Rebels shook Duke out of
its shirts, shorts, socks, sneakers and any underclothes they
happened to be wearing. They stole the ball so often that the
Dukies must have wondered if they were ever going to get a
chance to play with it, and scorched the hardwood with their
fast break. Never headed, they racked up a 30-point victory
-- 103-73 -- in a tournament whose recent history suggested
that its sponsoring organization's initials stood for Nobody
Comes out Ahead Alot.
   Afterward, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski could only marvel at
the skill of his executioners. "We couldn't function out
there tonight. They didn't let us play well. That's the best
a team has ever played against me as a coach," he said with
astonishment.
   UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian -- whose dozen-year legal
battle with the NCAA to prevent his firing for misdeeds
associated with the care and feeding of players was college
sports' longest-running soap opera before it was settled last
year -- was asked if the victory constituted "sweet revenge."
He replied, "It wasn't revenge, but it was sweet. Winning the
trophy wasn't a personal thing with me. Nevada and Las Vegas
get knocked a lot. I look at it as a big event for the people
there."
   If the Tark sounded a bit defensive, it was because the
assembled newsfolk, never apt at resisting temptation,
couldn't pass up the one to portray UNLV-Duke as good guys
vs. bad guys, or, at least, outlaws versus in-laws. The
outlaws, of course, were the boys from Vegas, who besides
their lengthy past rap sheet had woofed and brawled through a
stormy pre-tourney campaign in which, at times, they swung
first and identified their victims later. For instance, Moses
Scurry, a burly backup center, decked Utah State coach Kohn
Smith in one post-game melee. He later said he didn't know
he'd hit a coach because he thought coaches wore suits and
the guy he'd popped had a sweater on.
   Duke qualified as the in-laws if only on grounds of
frequency of visits: three years in a row to the Final Four,
and four of the last five. But that's all relative. The Blue
Devils from Durham, N.C., are college hoops' student princes,
a rep they owe partly to their school's propensity to send
its athletes into the world with diplomas as well as Adidas
in their gym bags.
   Final Four participants, though, were ever at pains to
remind that this was the Basket Bowl, not the Quiz Bowl. And,
in truth, the finalists had much in common. Both recruit more
by airplane than auto (each had but one home-state player in
their lineups) and turn over their rosters every few years as
required. Both featured hard-to-master pressure defenses and
fast-stepping, "motion" offenses.
   "We and UNLV are very similar in terms of systems and
personnel," said Krzyzewski on Sunday. Grinned the weary-eyed
Tark: "Duke's my favorite team next to UNLV."
   As for the academic differences between the schools, young
Anthony noted that it takes all kinds to make the world go
round. "Everybody's background doesn't prepare them for
Harvard, Yale or Duke. That's why there's state schools," he
said. "Anyway, based on what I've seen, you don't have to be
terrifically intelligent to graduate from college, just work
hard. And we do that."
   The Rebs certainly worked hard, and smart, in the two
games that brought their school its first national basketball
championship. On Saturday, their man-to-man-eating defense
turned a 53-46 halftime disadvantage into a 90-81 win over
Georgia Tech in the semis, leading some to dub Tech as the
only school to lose twice in the tourney. (Tech beat Michigan
State by an overtime point in the round of 16 after tying the
game in regulation with a shot generally adjudged to have
been fired after the buzzer.)
   In its semi match, Duke turned Arkansas's "40 minutes of
hell" defense into 30 minutes of hell and 10 of
helter-skelter, outscoring the pooped porkers 35-14 down the
stretch in a 97-83 triumph.
   Monday night's fray, before a privileged 17,000 in
McNichols (the event demands a much-larger, football-dome
venue), was all UNLV. The Rebs stole the ball a record 16
times from the discombobulated Devils, and shot a near-record
61.2% from the field.
   Rebel big man Larry Johnson hit the three-pointers, and
little-man Anderson Hunt shot, slammed and jammed for a
game-high 29 points. The deft Anthony had 13 points, five
steals and six assists. Long-armed defensive specialist
Stacey Augmon held Robert Brickey, a Duke stalwart against
Arkansas, to four points, and got 12 himself.
   Duke's leading scorer was Phil Henderson with 21 points,
but he was 1-for-8 from three-point range, and of little help
when his team needed to rally.
   Duke surged but once, cutting a 16-point UNLV first-half
lead to 10 points, 57-47, with 16:24 to play. From there,
though, the Rebels took off on a three-minute,
18-straight-point run that put the game away. In one stretch,
UNLV engineered fastbreak baskets off steals on three
consecutive Duke possessions. Poor Bobby Hurley, Duke's
freshman ball handler, had two points, three assists and five
turnovers to show for 32 minutes of play.
   Anthony remarked later that the blitz "took the starch"
out of Duke, and Duke guard Henderson agreed. "When we played
better, so did they. It seemed like they never got tired," he
said in his team's locker room. "Maybe nobody told them that
we're a mile high here, and they weren't supposed to do
that."
