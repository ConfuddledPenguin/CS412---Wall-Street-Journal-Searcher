   NEW YORK -- Urcarco has already changed the history of
Western capitalism. Previously, it was thought that the
used-car industry was unsuitable for public financing.
   But last November, the Fort Worth, Texas, company sold 3.9
million shares, at $11 apiece, in an initial public offering.
The stock has since risen 133% to 25 5/8.

   The stock market thus is valuing at close to half a
billion dollars a company that runs 18 used-car lots in
Texas. And the stock is trading over the counter at 30 times
earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending in June.
   But the stock's surge is no less noteworthy than its
underlying premise. Urcarco sells cars to people who cannot
get credit from banks, credit unions, manufacturers, their
grandmothers or anyone else. Its average customer earns
$24,000. "We sell quality cars to people who have had a
credit problem," Clifton H. Morris Jr., its chairman, says.
"We almost act as their financial consultant."
   As a consultant, Urcarco naturally charges high rates of
interest -- an average of 21%. It also charges high prices.
Typically, it purchases a used car for $3,500, spends up to
$1,000 getting it in shape and sells it for about $8,000 --
nearly double its cost.
   Its customers have no alternative -- except, now and then,
to walk away from their loans. Urcarco requires a down
payment of only 5% to 20%. Customers' investments in their
cars, at least in the first year, are slight. And a person
will pay interest of 21% only for as long as he can afford
to, and only for as long as he must.
   Urcarco has thought about this. It takes an accounting
charge of about 37% of its gross margin at the time of each
sale, as a provision for possible losses. The company says it
anticipates an actual repossession rate of one-third, or 33%.
Ray Wilkin, its chief financial officer, says "right now,
taking all the information we have . . . we have concluded
that the repo rate is 25% to 30%. That's what gives us
comfort at this point in time."
   But neither Mr. Wilkin nor anyone else professes to know
for certain what the repo rate will be. "You never know what
the repo rate is until you get out about three years," Mr.
Wilkin says. And Urcarco has been doing business only since
1987. Sales have climbed so rapidly that three-year-old repo
data aren't useful as a guide. In the final six months of
calendar 1988 the company sold 1,644 cars; in the 1989 half,
7,533.
   Repos in the first two months of 1990 were equal to 23% of
the total cars sold in the same period. But since the
repossessed cars were typically sold in 1989, when total
sales were running at a lower rate, repos would appear to be
higher than 23%.
   The repo rate is even harder to predict because Urcarco's
sales focus has recently been changing, with the company
targeting higher-priced and newer cars and offering longer
financing terms.
   Mr. Morris says "our repo rate is getting better. We're
getting a better knowledge of our customer base." Also, he
says, the company is developing new, firmer criteria for
making loans and it is boosting the down payment minimum. "We
don't take just anybody," a spokeswoman says.
   Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, Urcarco's underwriter, is bullish.
Every other analyst that follows Urcarco's soaring stock is
bullish. Earnings are up 15-fold for the six months ended
Dec. 31. And analysts say the potential for further growth is
huge, because Urcarco competes only with small,
undercapitalized mom `n' pop dealers.
   Quoting Alex. Brown: "Urcarco represents the first attempt
to bring professional management, capital and a high level of
integrity" to used cars. Quoting Gulfstream Financial
Associates: "Urcarco is revolutionizing the $40 billion
used-car industry, offering blue-collar America an attractive
alternative . . . "
   Michael Milken discovered, or thought he did, that
speculative-grade corporate borrowers were better risks than
investors thought. Urcarco's "discovery" is that cars can be
sold at a profit to speculative-grade people. If the company
is right, then competition will follow. If it is wrong, and
repo rates rise, the "income" may evaporate.
   The company eats up $4 million or so in cash a month, a
total that rises with sales. Only down the road, when
contracts mature and growth levels off, will Urcarco turn
cash-positive.
   With so many risks, where is the margin for error in
Urcarco's stock? The shares amount to a bet that loans will
be paid off and margins will stay high -- and at its current
price the bet is none too cheap.
