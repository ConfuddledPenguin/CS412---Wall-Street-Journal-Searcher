   WASHINGTON -- After nine years of trying, the Senate last
night passed the first comprehensive clean-air bill to clear
either house of Congress since 1977. But feuds are already
bubbling over at the legislation's next stop: the House.
   The vote in the Senate was 89 to 11.

   Unless the bill's leaders move to prevent it, strong
pro-environment sentiment on the House floor could mean a
bill that is even tougher on industry than the one passed by
the Senate. Scores of business and environmental lobbyists
are now descending on the House to try to shape the next step
of the process.
   At stake is historic legislation to make the nation
breathe easier, but with the power to push up electricity
rates, raise car prices, shut down factories and idle
workers. The Bush administration figures the Senate bill
could cost U.S. business as much as $21.5 billion annually by
the year 2005, when the measures are to be fully implemented.
Though there is debate about exactly how large the cost will
be, consumers ultimately will bear much of it.
   Environmentalists are determined to press House members to
pass an even more stringent bill than the Senate. "Our
overall view is that the Senate clean-air bill requires major
surgery," says Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club.
"Hopefully, we'll find many good doctors in the House."
   Industry will try to undo some of what it sees as costly
damage done by the Senate. Says William Fay, head of an
industrywide lobbying group: "You don't get a lot of extra
environmental benefit from the Senate bill, but you add
incredibly to the cost and burden on American business."
   President Bush signaled yesterday that he intends to keep
pushing for a middle ground. "I again reject the extremists
in the environmental movement who would burden our economy by
mindless regulation," Mr. Bush said in Indiana, where he was
on a political fund-raising trip. "And I reject those who do
not recognize their obligation to clean up the environment.
Common sense tells us to find a needed balance. We will find
that balance."
   Industry isn't likely to find much solace in the House if
its pleas have to be dealt with in recorded votes. Rising
public concern for the environment will be a bigger factor
there than it had been in the Senate. The 20th anniversary of
Earth Day on April 22 is sure to turn up the political heat.
Some White House officials close to clean-air negotiations
fear that lawmakers will cast votes in order to appear
sensitive to the environment, regardless of costs.
   Industry is pinning its hopes on Rep. John Dingell, the
chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. An unabashed
protector of auto companies, he is sympathetic to many
industry complaints. Mr. Dingell could keep some of the
hottest issues from roll-call votes on the floor by locking
them up in compromises in his committee, which is voting on
its own clean-air bill this week.
   Already the Michigan Democrat has agreed to accept harsher
cutbacks in exhaust emissions from new cars in order to
secure a binding agreement with the panel's chief
environmentalist, Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman from smoggy
Los Angeles. Committee approval of that agreement effectively
keeps that issue out of debate on the House floor.
   And just yesterday, Mr. Dingell also won unanimous
agreement from his committee for a compromise on regulating
cancer-causing factory emissions, a move also aimed at
preventing a contentious floor showdown on the issue.
   The White House is pivotal in this tug of war between
business and environmental interests. Business groups are
pressing the administration to stick to a more lenient
package it proposed last year. But the White House and its
chief clean-air sponsors, including Mr. Dingell, have already
sent strong signals that they don't believe the
administration-backed bill would pass without stricter
constraints.
   Steelmakers appear to be more concerned about the
legislation than any other industrial group. A provision in
the Senate bill threatens mandatory shutdowns within 10 years
if chemical plants, refineries and coke ovens are unable to
meet strict new emission standards designed to lessen the
risk of cancer to residents of areas near the facilities.
About 200 steelworkers from LTV Corp. and USX Corp. protested
at the Capitol yesterday, contending that their jobs are on
the line.
   The Senate bill would exempt the steel industry from
shutdowns for the next 30 years provided the industry meets
more stringent emission standards. But steel officials say
the provision would require them to move faster and spend
more to cut emissions than any other industry. They estimate
the cost to be more than $5 billion by 1995, which they say
would funnel money away from modernization efforts and hurt
their competitiveness.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, however, argues that steelmakers
don't deserve any special break. The Ohio Democrat says that
emissions from steelmakers' coke ovens are among the most
dangerous. Besides, he says, "I do not believe there will be
plant closings and job layoffs" as a result of the stricter
standards.
   Big oil companies also feel gouged. They foresee expensive
refinery and distribution changes by 1992 if they are forced
to add ethanol or methanol to reformulated gasoline, as the
Senate bill demands. The American Petroleum Institute, the
main oil trade group, says the new gasoline would cost 20
cents to 25 cents more a gallon. The fuel would be sold in
the nation's nine smoggiest cities.
   Auto makers say they lack the technology to cut emissions
as aggressively and as fast as the Senate legislation
requires. Key House members already have staked out a similar
though slightly less tough position on tailpipe exhausts. The
industry will have wait until later to press for changes when
a House-Senate conference hammers out differences between the
legislation passed by the chambers.
   High-sulfur-coal companies and miners failed to win relief
in the Senate from acid-rain provisions. The Senate bill
calls for industry to spend $4 billion a year to neutralize
acid rain. Unless Midwesterners in the House can pull off an
acid-rain aid package, which is highly unlikely, producers
such as Consolidation Coal Co. and Island Creek Corp. say
they will lose customers as utilities switch to low-sulfur
coal. Some 11,000 to 16,000 miners of high-sulfur coal,
principally in West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and
Pennsylvania, may lose their jobs.
   But environmentalists have their problems with the Senate
bill, too. They believe that Senate leaders started out with
an environmentally aggressive proposal, but made too many
concessions in an effort to avoid a White House veto or
Republican filibuster on the floor.
   Without tougher smog provisions than are in the Senate
bill, environmentalists predict that many cities will miss
their deadlines for reducing unhealthful smog levels. They
also say that auto companies aren't pushed hard enough to
develop new technologies to reduce tailpipe emissions in cars
to be built after the year 2003.
   Despite the threat of automatic shutdown for plants that
can't meet stricter emission standards, environmentalists are
upset that cancer risks won't be eliminated for people living
near polluting plants. They also claim the Senate bill
restricts the authority of the federal government to step in
when smoggy areas fail to create their own
pollution-reduction plans.
   "If the standard is `Is this bill better than current
law?' it obviously is," says Gene Karpinski, executive
director of U.S. Public Interest Research Group. "If the
standard is `Is this as good as we should have done?' it
obviously is not."
   But while industries and regions of the country are locked
in their own individual battles for relief, a great deal of
the air-pollution issue is all but decided.
   The legislation sets standards for the next decade or so
with respect to all the major issues, including car exhausts,
acid rain, toxic industrial emissions and alternative fuels.
But it also goes further in an effort to set clean-air
standards for the first decade of the next century. Much of
the House debate is expected to focus on these long-range
goals.
   "If we had had a bill that addressed the clean-air
problems in the U.S. for the next 10 or 12 years alone, we'd
have had very few arguments," says William Reilly, chief of
the Environmental Protection Agency. "It's only when you move
into that second phase that you see very large cost numbers
and very large differences of opinion."
   Billions of dollars of pollution regulation, much of it in
Mr. Bush's original clean-air proposal, is now accepted and
has not drawn serious challenge in Congress.
   Surprisingly, one of the least controversial provisions of
the bill puts the nation's first acid-rain control law on the
books, requiring coal-burning power plants to cut their
emissions.
   For years, ferocious battling by coal and utility
interests made acid rain the key stumbling block to passage
of sweeping clean-air legislation. President Reagan doubted
acid rain was a serious problem. But Mr. Bush's campaign
pledge to address acid rain, combined with agreement between
the White House and environmentalists on a 10 million-ton
sulfur-dioxide reduction, have forced even the oldest foes to
admit the inevitably of acid-rain controls.
   Even though many utility companies are skeptical the
scheme will ever work, lawmakers generally agree that there
is a need for an innovative pollution trading system to hold
down the pricetag for acidrain controls. Under the proposed
system, utilities that voluntarily made extra-deep cuts would
get pollution credits; they could sell or swap these credits
to other utilities, which could then use them to expand. A
nationwide cap on total power-plant emissions theoretically
would preserve cleanair gains for decades.
   There is widespread agreement among lawmakers to junk a
regulatory system that has set standards on air emissions of
only seven toxic chemicals in 20 years. Most legislators now
agree instead on requiring factories, from chemical plants to
dry cleaners, to install the best anti-pollution technology
available. The goal would be to prevent at least 2,200 annual
cancer deaths from toxic industrial emissions, while also
reducing birth defects and respiratory disease. The deep
differences lie in how to cut the remaining emissions.
   Lawmakers have reached general agreement on setting
deadlines to reduce smog. Rather than imposing a single
nationwide deadline for cleaning up smog, the new approach is
to tailor deadlines to fit cities' pollution problems. Los
Angeles, the smoggiest city, for example, would have until
the year 2010 to eliminate unhealthy levels of ozone, the
main ingredient in smog. There is also general agreement that
auto emissions must get cleaner. Exactly how clean remains at
issue.
   One of the biggest changes from previous attempts to clean
up smog in cities is to require not only that vehicles be
cleaner-burning but that their fuel get cleaner as well.
President Bush proposed the idea, and now both houses of
Congress seem to be buying it. The fuel of choice remains to
be decided. However, policy makers are tilting toward a
reformulated gasoline.
   Here are the major unsettled issues likely to confront the
House, where Mr. Dingell's committee hopes to complete its
work on clean-air legislation this week. The full House hopes
to take up the legislation in May.
                                                                                                       

   -- ACID RAIN: Whether to help Midwest utilities shoulder
the steep cost of acid rain controls -- an issue that has
stymied clean-air legislation for years -- will probably be
decided through a bruising regional battle, possibly this
week in committee.
   Rep. Phil Sharp, an Indiana Democrat whose state would be
hit with higher electricity bills because of acid-rain
controls, leads the advocates for a subsidy for the
Midwestern utility companies that would have to do the bulk
of the acid-rain cleanup. He is pitted against lawmakers from
states, such as some in the West, whose utilities have
already cleaned up their emissions and don't want to bail out
the Midwest.
   There may also be an attempt to provide extra unemployment
benefits for high-sulfur coal miners who will lose their
jobs. An effort to legislate such relief in the Senate failed
by a single vote.
                                                                                                       

   -- ALTERNATIVE FUELS: On split votes, Mr. Dingell's
committee has adopted an alternative-fuels program that
relies heavily on reformulated gasoline in the nine smoggiest
cities. But the issue is destined to arise again on the House
floor.
   Rep. Waxman and Rep. Bill Richardson, a New Mexico
Democrat, plan to push for a tougher program requiring wide
use of reformulated gas for cars and evencleaner
alternatives, like natural gas, for fleet vehicles. Big Oil's
patrons, led by Texas Reps. Ralph Hall, a Democrat, and Jack
Fields, a Republican, will try to hold the line.
                                                                                                       

   -- CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS: Environmentalists hope to persuade
the House to match a Senate provision that would require the
U.S., ahead of other countries, to phase out
chlorofluorocarbons entirely. CFCs, used chiefly as
refrigerants, tend to deplete the Earth's ozone layer, the
atmospheric layer that screens out much ultraviolet
radiation. However, the administration opposes a unilateral
ban on CFCs in favor of international agreements to phase out
the chemicals.
   For the Senate, the path to approving a clean-air bill was
anything but smooth. Early on, fears of a presidential veto
or Republican filibuster -- prompted by industry outcries
over the cost of a committee-approved bill -- sent Senate
leaders and the White House into four weeks of closed-door
negotiations. There, they cut the crucial deals, including
the exemption for coke ovens and the extra pollution
allowances for utility companies, that are behind the Senate
bill.
   Despite opposition from industry and environmental groups,
the compromise held. During a month of votes on the floor,
lawmakers turned back an effort to wring additional
reductions in air pollution from cars and fuel and refused to
maintain a strong federal role in forcing states and cities
to clean up smog. They also killed a provision that would
have allowed factories whose fumes pose cancer risks to buy
out adjoining neighborhoods if they couldn't reduce the
health risk.
   The result is a Senate bill that doesn't totally please
either environmentalists or industry. Business is so upset,
in fact, that at a contentious closed-door meeting recently,
industry leaders lashed out at White House officials for
compromising with Senate leaders on air-pollution controls
that many corporate leaders feel are too expensive.
