   BOSTON -- Fliers on the Trump Shuttle have gotten used to
free newspapers and magazines. Next week, Lotus Development
Corp. is going to give them software.
   Lotus will pass out coupons good for a free copy of
Magellan -- a $195 utility program for managing hard disks --
to every traveler flying the shuttle into New York's La
Guardia Airport. Lotus expects an eager reception: It says
93% of shuttle travelers have personal computers.

   Although Magellan got rave reviews when it came out last
year, its high price and established competitors held sales
to the "tens of thousands," a spokeswoman says. In a few
weeks, Lotus plans to introduce an improved and lower-priced
version, at $139. And giving away the older model will help
clear out inventory.
