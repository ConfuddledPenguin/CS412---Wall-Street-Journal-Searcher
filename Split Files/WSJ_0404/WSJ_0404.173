   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said China extended an agreement
with the St. Louis-based aerospace concern for joint
production of MD-80 twin-jet airliners. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The extension calls for 20 planes to be built by Shanghai
Aviation Industrial Corp., with subassemblies and parts
shipped from McDonnell's commercial aircraft unit in Long
Beach, Calif., and brings China's total MD-80 orders to 50.

   Under the initial contract signed in 1985, Shanghai
Aviation agreed to buy 26 MD-80s over six years and took
options on 15 others. Analysts then said the deal had an
indicated value of $1 billion if all the options were
exercised. The latest accord continues the co-production
arrangement, though the options technically expired. MD-80s
usually sell for about $25 million each, but it wasn't clear
how that value would be affected by the Chinese agency's
manufacturing contribution.
   McDonnell also said it is discussing with China-controlled
domestic airlines the possible sale of as many as 150
aircraft, part of the MD-90 twin-jet series being developed
for service in 1994.
