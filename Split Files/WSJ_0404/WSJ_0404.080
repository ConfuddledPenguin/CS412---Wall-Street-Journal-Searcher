   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $2.4 billion
supplemental spending bill for fiscal 1990 that includes most
of President Bush's request for aid to Panama and Nicaragua.
   The measure, approved on a 362-59 vote, includes nearly
$1.5 billion in new spending authority for a variety of
domestic programs that Mr. Bush didn't seek, and shifts
priorities within the president's foreign-aid request.

   The measure would offset $1.8 billion of the new spending
authority for the year that began Oct. 1 with rescissions of
previously approved Pentagon funding. But it would still add
$665 million to the current fiscal year's deficit, which the
Congressional Budget Office projects at $158 billion.
   Mr. Bush said he wanted the measure on his desk by
tomorrow. But swift action in the Senate isn't likely.
Democratic leaders there, including Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine and Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert Byrd of West Virginia, have expressed reservations
about the amount of money the president is seeking for the
two Central American nations.
   The House-passed bill would cut Mr. Bush's aid request for
a one-time aid infusion for Panama to $420 million from $500
million. But it would authorize the $300 million he sought
for Nicaragua as the first installment of a multiyear aid
program.
   Of the Nicaraguan aid, $30 million would help pay for
costs of repatriating the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, who have
agreed to disband before the new democratically elected
government takes power later this month.
   The supplemental measure also includes $442 million to
replenish Interior Department and National Park Service funds
spent to fight Western forest fires and to clean up oil
spilled from the Exxon Valdez, and $111 million in disaster
aid related to Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake
last year and the recent flooding in the Southeast.
   An additional $96 million would be provided to make up a
shortfall in state unemployment-insurance programs brought on
by higher-than-projected joblessness.
   In foreign-aid accounts, the bill would provide an
additional $70 million to transport refugees to the U.S. and
Israel from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; $30 million
for southern Africa, with $10 million each designated for the
newly independent nation of Namibia and to promote democracy
in South Africa; $25 million in food aid for refugees
world-wide; $15 million for Eastern Caribbean nations
including Jamaica; $5 million to help repair damage from
Hurricane Hugo in three Caribbean nations, and $5 million for
Soviet Jewish refugees in Israel.
   The measure would remove the U.S. Export-Import Bank's
limitation on medium-term loans. Ex-Im Bank officials say
that would allow them to make more loans to Panama and
Eastern Europe. Another provision would provide the World
Bank with $1.6 billion in callable capital for use if the
bank encountered financial difficulties.
   The military-spending rescissions come from a wide range
of personnel, procurement, research-and-development and
construction accounts. The largest single item is a $238
million cut in the production at a Louisiana facility of
explosives used in shells.
   About $212 million would come out of purchases of spare
and repair parts, $100 million from slowing down Air Force
personnel transfers, and $82.9 million from a personnel
freeze in all of the uniformed services, including the Army,
Navy and Air Force reserves and the Army and Air National
Guards.
