   The New York Court of Appeals ruled that CBS Inc. can sue
Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. for allegedly providing misleading
financial information when CBS bought a dozen of Ziff's
magazines in 1984.
   The ruling by the state's highest court partially reverses
a decision by a lower court judge, who had dismissed all of
CBS's claims against Ziff, a unit of Ziff Communications Co.,
in 1988. The appellate court will let the case proceed on one
of CBS's claims, for breach of warranty.

   The decision, which can't be appealed, propels the parties
into the pretrial fact-finding, or discovery, stage of the
case. No trial date has yet been set to decide the merits of
the suit, in which CBS seeks $40 million. Spokesmen for both
communications companies say there has been no talk of
settlement.
   CBS bought Popular Photography, Car &amp; Driver, Modern Bride
and other magazines for $362.5 million in 1984. Even before
it closed the deal, CBS claimed that Ziff-Davis had
overstated the magazines' profits by as much as $4 million --
thus inflating the selling price by as much as $40 million.
CBS said at the time it was reserving the right to challenge
Ziff's data. But Ziff claimed that by going forward with the
deal at the stated price, CBS showed that it was not relying
on the accuracy of Ziff's data.
   After failing to resolve the matter, CBS sued Ziff and its
auditor, Touche Ross &amp; Co., in 1985, alleging fraud,
misrepresentation, breach of contract and breach of warranty.
Later, CBS joined the new magazines with its own magazine
group and sold the entire unit for $650 million in 1987.
   "CBS was not merely buying identified consumer magazine
businesses," Judge Stewart F. Hancock Jr. wrote for a 4-1
majority of the appeals court. "It was buying businesses
which it believed to be of a certain value based on
information furnished by the seller which the seller
warranted to be true."
   "We are, of course, delighted that the court reinstated
the breach-of-warranty claim," said Douglas P. Jacobs, CBS
associate general counsel.
   Ziff's general counsel J. Malcolm Morris described the
ruling as "a technical point of New York law." He added, "We
continue to believe, as we have since 1985, that there is no
basis whatsoever for any of CBS's remaining claims."

   IRAN-CONTRA JURORS are sequestered after calls from
reporters.
   The judge in the Iran-Contra trial of former national
security adviser John Poindexter sequestered the jury, which
is in deliberations, after two jurors said they were
contacted by reporters. In a hastily called hearing in
federal court in Washington yesterday morning, Judge Harold
Greene indicated that he had considered but decided against
declaring a mistrial after learning about the contacts, at
least one of which came from a reporter for the Washington
Post.
   The Post's national news editor, Robert Kaiser, said the
paper voluntarily called the judge Monday to apologize for
the actions of its reporter, Nora Boustany. Mr. Kaiser said
that Ms. Boustany, until recently the newspaper's Beirut
correspondent, had just arrived in this country and didn't
know that jurors aren't supposed to be contacted during a
trial or deliberations.
   Judge Greene said the two jurors had informed him that
each was contacted by telephone Monday by a woman identifying
herself as a reporter. The jurors told the judge at
yesterday's hearing that they had hung up as soon as the
callers said they were reporters.
   The Post's Mr. Kaiser said Ms. Boustany had been asked to
find out how to contact only one juror after the trial had
ended. Ms. Boustany declined to answer any questions. It was
unclear who had called the second juror.
   The judge, obviously angry, said, "Some people might
consider what has gone on an obstruction of justice." He
indicated that he was still considering seeking penalties as
a result of the incident.
   The judge could, for example, refer the situation to the
U.S. attorney in Washington as a possible case of attempting
to influence a juror, which is a federal crime. But in order
to be found guilty of that crime, a person would have to be
shown to have had a "specific intent" to affect the outcome
of a trial.
   Mr. Kaiser said Ms. Boustany had no such intent. Instead,
she and a number of other Post reporters were each assigned
to find out how to contact one member of the jury after the
trial ended, Mr. Kaiser said. "She is a Lebanese who has
never worked or lived in America," he added. "We made a
mistake" by assigning an uninformed reporter to help cover
the trial, Mr. Kaiser said.
   Neither the defense nor prosecution objected to the
judge's decision not to declare a mistrial.
   The 12-person jury will be sequestered in the evenings in
a Washington-area hotel, according to a court staff member.

   ANTI-TAKEOVER BILL is passed by Pennsylvania House of
Representatives.
   The House, in passing one of the most restrictive
anti-takeover bills in the nation by a 182-10 vote, joined
the state Senate in endorsing the proposal.
   Among other provisions, the bill would strip all profits
from short-term holders who sell their shares within 18
months of making a failed bid for control of the company
through "any means." The profits would be turned over to the
target company, which would be required to invest the funds
in Pennsylvania. A controversial proposal to exempt
management from certain existing restrictions on proxy fights
was not included in the final House version of the bill.
   While the proposed law must go back to the Senate for
approval of several amendments, the bill is likely to become
law, possibly by the end of this month.
   The state Senate, committed to enacting some kind of
anti-raider legislation, passed the original version 45-4,
and Gov. Robert Casey recently expressed his support for the
measures.

   MARCOS CASE begins with defense lawyer's account blaming
U.S. officials.
   In a bizarre tale involving George Bush, Moammar Gadhafi
and a legendary gold treasure allegedly hidden in the
Philippines, Imelda Marcos's lawyer told jurors that the
Marcoses secretly hid millions of dollars in the U.S. at the
urging of American officials.
   Gerry Spence, Mrs. Marcos's chief attorney in the federal
racketeering case in Manhattan, said he would prove that
then-Vice President Bush had encouraged the Marcoses to
invest Philippine assets in the U.S. as a secret "communist
security plan" that could be used in the event of a communist
takeover of the Philippines.
   Mr. Spence said he wants to call Mr. Bush as a witness to
prove that the U.S. knew that millions of dollars were being
held in secret bank accounts and investments in this country.
Mr. Spence said that Mr. Bush made the suggestion in person
in 1981 to deter the Marcoses from investing in Libya. The
lawyer said Mrs. Marcos had developed a friendship with
Libya's Mr. Gadhafi in the 1970s.
   Mr. Spence said Mr. Bush advised the Marcoses to buy
Manhattan property, which is at the heart of the government's
allegations in the case. Mrs. Marcos is accused of plundering
the Philippines of more than $160 million and then illegally
concealing the money through the purchase of three
skyscrapers and a shopping mall in Manhattan.
   "The Marcoses, in an attempt to keep the good will of this
country, abandoned plans to invest in Libya and began to
purchase New York real estate," Mr. Spence said. He said he
would prove that the Central Intelligence Agency "was aware
of every transaction that took place in this case."
   Spokesmen for the White House and the CIA said they don't
comment on pending trials.
   In seeking to turn the prosecutors' case on its head, Mr.
Spence said he didn't dispute that ownership of the
properties had been kept secret. Nor did he dispute charges
that money from the Philippine treasury was used to buy the
properties. Instead, he said the late President Marcos was
keeping the money safe.
   "You don't protect funds from a communist takeover unless
you hide them," Mr. Spence said. "He went to extreme efforts
to hide the funds. Evidence of the hiding is totally
undisputed. It was necessary to do it."
   In seeking to challenge prosecutors' claims that the
Marcoses became wealthy off bribes and the skimming of
Philippine government funds, Mr. Spence told the jury that
the Marcos wealth was attained when Mr. Marcos discovered
gold allegedly hidden by the Japanese in the Philippines. He
said he would call as a witness "an old man" from the
Philippines to testify that Mr. Marcos had taken carloads of
gold, the existence of which is viewed skeptically by many
Filipino historians.
   President Marcos, who ruled under martial law for 14
years, was overthrown in a revolution in 1986. Afterwards, he
and Mrs. Marcos took refuge in Hawaii, where they allegedly
continued the racketeering enterprise.
   Debra Livingston, an assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting
the case, told jurors the government will prove that Mrs.
Marcos took an active role in directing the alleged scheme of
fraud.
   "You are going to learn that Imelda Marcos and Ferdinand
Marcos together were partners in crime," she said, adding
that Mrs. Marcos "treated the New York branch office of the
Philippines National Bank, which is a government operated
bank, as her own personal piggy bank."

   A NEWSPAPER may depreciate the value of paid subscribers
it acquires.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin in
Newark, N.J., came in a case brought by Newark Morning Ledger
Co., a unit of the Newhouse family's Advance Publications,
against the federal government.
   Ledger took depreciation deductions with respect to paid
subscribers it obtained as part of its 1977 purchase of Booth
Newspapers Inc., a Michigan newspaper chain. The Internal
Revenue Service disallowed the deductions, a decision that
would have cost Ledger millions of dollars. Ledger also owns
the Newark Star Ledger newspaper.
   Albert Turkus, a Washington attorney who represented
Ledger, said the ruling will likely affect many other
businesses that wish to depreciate such intangible assets as
a customer base.
   Judge Sarokin disagreed with the IRS claim that
subscribers have indefinite life for tax purposes and
therefore shouldn't be depreciated. Judge Sarokin found that
subscribers "are not self-regenerating assets," and that they
can only be replaced at substantial cost and effort.
   Donald Robinson, a Newark, N.J., attorney also
representing Ledger, said the company is pleased by the
decision. An IRS spokesman says the government hasn't yet
decided whether it will appeal the decision.
