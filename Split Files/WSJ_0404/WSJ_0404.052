   NEW YORK -- Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. hired the
third person in a year to head its institutional
stock-trading desk.
   Martin Brophy, 47 years old, joined the firm this week as
head of equity capital commitment. He was hired by Edward
Braniff, president of the firm's equity division. Mr. Brophy
previously worked at UBS Securities Inc. as a block trader.

   Prior to Mr. Brophy, the big securities firm's equity desk
was run by Philip Puccio. Mr. Puccio resigned from the firm
in early March to join another brokerage concern. He had
succeeded Dan Marciano, who resigned from the firm last May
after the firm said he and another trader violated the firm's
trading policies.
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is a division of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
