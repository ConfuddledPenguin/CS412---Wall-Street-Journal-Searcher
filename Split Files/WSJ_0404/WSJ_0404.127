   New York -- Now that Franco Zeffirelli has designed a
handsome new "Don Giovanni" for the Metropolitan, could he
please come back and finish directing it?
   At the premiere the other night, the most enjoyable
performance came from the sets. They were large and nimble
and entirely worthy of our undivided attention whenever they
rolled in on their little wheels. My major regret was that
Mr. Zeffirelli did not also think to outfit his not-so-nimble
cast with individual dollies. Mostly, they just stood there
like well, statues, obscuring very attractive grillwork.

   The best ironwork decorates Donna Anna's huge palace and,
happily, the opera's plot let us admire it twice. The first
time around, its noble resident distracted us by dropping to
the floor in a faint after the Don Giovanni of the evening,
Samuel Ramey, pawed her bosom and bared his teeth.
   Even so, the production was short on laughs. You may read
in the program that Mozart and his librettist, Lorenzo da
Ponte, wrote a "dramma giocoso," but the drama and jokey bits
still were waiting to be inserted when Mr. Zeffirelli ran out
of rehearsals.
   He evidently spent his time arranging for 11 smooth scene
changes that take us all the way to hell by the opera's end,
with Mr. Z adding a few extra touches typical of his
cheerfully overblown style. Normally, we have to make do with
just the statue of the murdered Commendatore coming to life.
Not anymore. In this production, many waving tomb statues
point the Don down to his fiery destination. Would that Mr.
Zeffirelli also could have written a new Mozart tune as they
stirred to life. But even Mr. Z's talent has some limit, it
seems.
   More often, though, this "Don Giovanni" shows signs of
actual restraint (by the abandoned standards of his amusingly
overblown "Turandot" anyhow), while still looking like the
million bucks -- plus it probably cost. Mr. Zeffirelli took
his design cues from the rococo theater of Mozart's day, when
his wizardly predecessors transformed bare planks into
"trompe l'oeil" worlds using pulleys and paints. Mr. Z's
world begins with the sun rising slowly during the overture
on an empty stage, a beautiful image that returns when the
Don has lived out his last, and very complicated, day.
   So there is no reason to linger sadly over the demise of
the old Eugene Berman production. Once interesting in an arty
sort of way, with lots of flats covered with bold
Mediterranean colors, Berman's sets were collapsing on the
cast the last time I saw it (and I wasn't even thinking
wishfully]). What made me remember it at all was its
Giovanni, the great Italian basso Cesare Siepi, who played
the Don with a sexy elegance and mocking humor that Mr. Ramey
barely suggests.
   Given no apparent direction, curiously frail-looking in
his outfits, Mr. Ramey slapped his head a lot in an
unconvincing display of animation and sang his music very
smoothly while slowly fading into the darkly glimmering sets
as the evening progressed -- until you needed the Hubble
interstellar telescope to pull him into focus.
   A low point was "La ci darem la mano," in which the Don's
dullness was doubled by duetizing with the show's Zerlina,
Dawn Upshaw. Come with me to my castle, "I'll change your
fate," promises the Don singing softly into the ear of this
peasant girl set to marry a bumpkin. "I want to . . . and I
don't," says she. I was struck by the beatific expression on
conductor James Levine's face as he turned sideways to
address the strings. Singing that uninflected and charmless
makes him happy?
   So it went for much of the evening. One might have
accepted what was essentially a concert performance sung in
front of sets, had the singing been interesting. It rarely
was. Mozart wrote a fabulous entry aria for Donna Elvira. The
Don has just ditched her and she is cooking with fury. "I'm
going to cut out his heart," she sings, stomping into
Seville. The descriptive vocal line goes up and down as she
relishes the surgery, not knowing that the man himself is
secretly observing her. This is as funny as opera gets. But
Karita Mattila's careful delivery and restrained gestures did
not inspire chuckles. She sang the notes very tidily indeed
and then sat down to calm her debut nerves by listening to
Leporello, the Don's sidekick, recite a catalog of his
master's amorous conquests. Poor Elvira is No. 1003 (and
that's just for Spain]). As far as I could tell, she seemed
to take it well. Mr. Z apparently didn't get around to
staging this scene either.
   Or the grotesque masquerade in the next act. Elvira,
pining, lonely, consumed by hope and memory, lets herself be
deluded into thinking that the Don is making nice to her in
the darkness of a town square, when it is in fact Leporello
wearing his hat and cape. We should be amused, not
embarrassed. Mr. Ramey and Ferruccio Furlanetto, presumably
left to their own devices, carried on like provincial clowns.
But never mind, Ms. Mattila somehow still came across as a
soprano one would like to see again in another opera. She is
an unusually striking woman with big eyes and a determined
chin, and the voice warms to a silvery sheen. "Mi tradi" got
the biggest hand of the evening.
   There was not much competition from Carol Vaness, a fine
singer quite miscast as Donna Anna, Elvira's frigid
counterpart. Her icy arias demand more cutting power than Ms.
Vaness could muster. At least her Ottavio, Jerry Hadley, was
a cut above the fat fop often cast as this useless man.
Elegant in Anna Anni's sumptuous costumes, he sang his
difficult music with an imperfect technique and a beautiful
tone.
   The most memorable moment came right after the Don's death
as the cast gathered to sing high-mindedly of evildoers
always coming to an evil end. Leporello sat alone in a
corner, cradling his master's catalog of conquests, looking
sad, and clearly missing the good times already. It was a
nice touch and suggested what Mr. Z might have been capable
of had he spent some time thinking about the characters
inside his gorgeous sets.
