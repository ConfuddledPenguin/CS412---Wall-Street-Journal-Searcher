   WASHINGTON -- The House Budget Committee is working on a
plan to reduce military spending by between $10 billion and
$14 billion from projected levels in fiscal 1991, panel
Chairman Leon Panetta said.
   The California Democrat said the committee, which has been
meeting privately, is likely to make a sharp cut in the
military budget, which has projected outlays of $306.9
billion in the year that begins Oct. 1. The precise reduction
hasn't yet been decided.

   The military spending total is the most contentious item
in the fiscal 1991 budget resolution. The non-binding budget
document also is likely to call for tax increases of $13.9
billion, the amount sought by President Bush, Mr. Panetta
said.
   Rep. Panetta predicted that the budget resolution would
pass the House, but was less certain about the outlook in the
Senate and the ability of even the House to pass legislation
that follows through with the document's guidelines.
   Action in the House Budget Committee is expected later
this month.
