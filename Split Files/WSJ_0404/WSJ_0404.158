   Hoechst AG, a West German chemical company, said its 1989
group pretax profit edged up 1.5% to 4.15 billion marks
($2.44 billion) from 4.09 billion marks in 1988, as
fourth-quarter earnings were hurt by the rise of the mark's
value against other major currencies.
   Hoechst didn't disclose fourth-quarter figures, but based
on a comparison with those for the third quarter, pretax
earnings dropped 10% to 1.02 billion marks from 1.13 billion
marks a year earlier.

   Hoechst said the weakness of the dollar, yen and pound
reduced the earnings contribution from its foreign
subsidiaries after conversion into marks. Based on exchange
rates at the end of October, full-year earnings would have
been 100 million marks higher than the sum reported, Hoechst
said, or a 4% rise in 1989 pretax profit. The weak results
were in line with expectations; analysts said Hoechst was
hurt by its large exposure to the U.S.
   Sales rose 12% to 45.89 billion marks in 1989 from 40.96
billion marks in 1988. Fourth-quarter sales increased 10% to
11.87 billion marks from 10.81 billion marks a year earlier.
