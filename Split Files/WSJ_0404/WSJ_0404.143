   Com Systems Inc. said it completed the issue and sale of
preferred stock and subordinated debentures valued at $22
million to OmniCorp International B.V., which owns 57% of the
company's stock on a fully diluted basis.
   The troubled Van Nuys, Calif., telecommunications firm
said it would use part of the proceeds to acquire TMC
Communications of Santa Barbara, a regional
telecommunications firm, for about $13 million.

   Com Systems said that it issued 4.5 million shares of a
new, Series C cumulative convertible preferred stock for $9
million to OmniCorp, which paid for the stock by canceling a
$9 million bridge loan with Com Systems. In 1988, Com Systems
reported a net loss of $5.8 million. Com Systems said it also
sold $13 million in aggregate principal amount of its
five-year, 11 1/2% convertible subordinated debentures to
OmniCorp, an affiliate of the Swiss conglomerate OmniCorp
Holdings Inc.
   In addition, Com Systems said it named Sandra Styles, 42
years old, as the first of three OmniCorp designees to its
seven-member board. The company said that Stephen Olson, 47,
Richard Hillman, 47, and Sol Gerber, 77, resigned from the
board.
