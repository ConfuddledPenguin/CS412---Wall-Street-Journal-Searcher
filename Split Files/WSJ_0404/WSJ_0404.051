   AMSTERDAM -- Dutch industrial sales rose by 5% in the
fourth quarter of 1989 from the year-ago period, according to
the Dutch state Central Bureau of Statistics.
   The bureau attributed 50% of the rise in sales directly to
higher prices charged in the latest quarter. Higher prices
were particularly evident in exports and accounted for 70% of
the increase in export sales while domestic price rises
accounted for only 30% of the increase in domestic sales.

   The Dutch petroleum industry alone accounted for 33% of
the increase in industrial sales in the fourth quarter, with
twothirds of the increase coming directly from higher prices.
