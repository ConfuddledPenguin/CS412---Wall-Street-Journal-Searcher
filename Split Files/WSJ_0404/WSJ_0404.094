   The Iraqi procurement ring detected in the act of shipping
40 krytron miniaturized nuclear triggers to Baghdad, provided
convincing evidence that Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons
program continues, despite the Israeli aerial attack on
Iraq's French-built Osirak reactor in June 1981. Experts
differ on how close the Iraqis have come to possessing the
bomb. But krytron switches are one of the last items required
for fielding an operational nuclear device.
   For several years Iraq has boasted of indigenous weapons
programs and its ability to acquire embargoed Western
technology through front companies and technology transfer
agreements. On Monday, Iraqi's President, Saddam Hussein,
bragged in a speech in Baghdad that Iraq now possessed a
stock of nerve gas -- which it is prepared to use against
Israel. Until recently, though, Mr. Hussein's claims have not
been taken seriously.

   When Iraq announced in August 1987 that it had launched a
locally developed ballistic missile, for instance, there was
relatively little fuss in the West. It was only when missiles
came crashing down on Tehran six months later that the world
woke up.
   To its credit, the U.S. government has been one of the few
attempting to do something about the Iraqi weapons programs.
Since 1987, high-ranking U.S. delegations have been
dispatched on numerous occasions to Paris, Bonn, Rome and
elsewhere, to protest the failure of those allies to block
sensitive technology sales to Iraq. Most of the protests,
were delivered in the context of the Missile Technology
Control Regime, signed by the U.S. and six allied nations in
April 1987. But U.S. protests have achieved little to stem
the tide of Western assistance to Iraq.
   In 1984, a group of former Italian intelligence officers
were indicted in Rome for conspiring to supply Iraq with 34
kilograms of plutonium -- enough to manufacture as many as
three nuclear devices -- and one ton of yellowcake, or
uranium ore. In 1987, the French government tentatively
offered to rebuild the damaged Osirak nuclear plant near
Baghdad, a plant capable of processing the yellowcake into
weapons-grade fuel.
   France's offer was in fact unnecessary. Iraq had already
begun a top-secret program to rebuild the Osirak reactor
immediately after the Israeli raid. Detailed interviews in
the Iraqi press earlier this year suggested that new isotope
manufacturing units began production in 1985 and 1988, and
that the reactor is fully functioning today. Last week, the
Saudi government acknowledged that it was partially funding
Iraqi nuclear research. The Saudis reassuringly insisted,
however, that the research is "entirely peaceful" in nature.
   U.S. intelligence officials were warning of the resumption
of the Iraqi effort to acquire nuclear weapons technology two
years ago, and accused China of having supplied a crucial
uranium enrichment plant. Some Western companies, attracted
by the fabulous bonuses Iraq was offering, also provided
help.
   Instead of purchasing pieces of equipment, Iraq, like
South Africa, Pakistan and Israel, has concentrated on
building up an indigenous industrial base, safe from future
embargo effects. A sealed indictment presented in San Diego
last week claimed that the krytron puchasing ring reported to
a state-owned Iraqi company, controlled by the Ministry of
Industry and Military Industries (MIMI). This is the same
ministry that is responsible for Iraq's ballistic missile,
its chemical weapons and its other armaments programs. Run by
Hussein Kamil Hasan, the nephew of the Iraqi president, and
employing a legion of well-trained armaments engineers, MIMI
has launched a crash effort to acquire the sophisticated
technologies and know-how to enable Iraq to become a
full-fledged manufacturer of a whole triad of strategic
weapons.
   Iraq is certainly hoping to cash in on the deterrent value
nuclear and chemical weapons provide. But a powerful
strategic arsenal confers other benefits as well. In 1973,
when Syria and Egypt launched their surprise attack on
Israel, Iraq was forced to sit on the sidelines. The armored
division it dispatched by road to Damascus as a gesture of
Arab solidarity barely arrived in time for the final days of
the battle. As a result, Iraq was left out of the negotating
process, an omission that left Iraqi leaders bitter and
disappointed.
   Mr. Hussein clearly intends to be remembered when it comes
time for the next round of negotiations -- or for the next
war. His strategic arsenal puts Iraq on the front lines with
Israel in a way that was never before possible. It also
provides him with leverage to persuade other Arab states to
back Iraq's pretension as the new leader of the Arab world,
supplanting Saddam Hussein's long-standing rival, Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
   As the post-World War II security arrangement between the
superpowers breaks up, Iraq is hoping to emerge as the
dominant political and military force in this volatile
region. This is not an aim that even the best orchestrated
customs sting operation can stop.
