   PARIS -- French industrialists operating in the
competitive sector expect their capital spending to grow by
between 14% and 15% this year after an increase of about 11%
in 1989, the National Statistics Institute said.
   The state-run data-gathering body noted that after
adjustment for inflation, industrial investment would show an
increase of about 11%, compared with 7% in 1989.

   It said the acceleration to a large extent reflects a
continuing strong investment trend in the automobile
industry, with car manufacturers racing to expand capacity.
   French industrialists have indicated frequently over the
past year or so that they have been held back from producing
more because of insufficient capacity.
