   MIAMI -- General Development Corp., a troubled Florida
developer, said it is closing its homesite sales operations
world-wide and firing 1,100 full-time and part-time sales and
administrative workers.
   On Monday, cash-hungry General Development said it
couldn't complete negotiations for a $60 million credit
facility, leaving it unable to pay more than $10 million in
property taxes due last Sunday. As a result, General
Development said it was considering all options, including a
filing for federal bankruptcy-law protection.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
General Development tumbled $1.25 a share, to close at $2.75.
   General Development has been trying to reverse liquidity
problems resulting from its recent legal troubles. Last
month, the company pleaded guilty to one felony count of
conspiracy in a plea bargain to settle charges that it
defrauded some 10,000 homebuyers by charging inflated prices
based on improper appraisals.
   In recent months, General Development laid off 500
workers. The latest cutback will reduce the number of workers
to about 3,400. General Development said it hopes to
introduce a new homesite business in the future, but for the
time being, the operation's "cost of generating sales . . .
no longer makes economic sense."
