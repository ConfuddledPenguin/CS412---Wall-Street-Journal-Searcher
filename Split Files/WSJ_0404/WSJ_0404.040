   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were largely unchanged in the week
ended yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs (generally, $500
to $10,000) at 18 banks surveyed by Banxquote Money Markets,
a New York information service, were flat or up only
slightly. The average yield on a one-year consumer CD was
7.93%, while five-year consumer CDs offered 8.15%.

   "There wasn't any significant change in the
foreign-exchange market, or in domestic interest rates that
would have any dramatic affect on the CD market," said
Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote.
   Average yields on small CDs sold by leading broker dealers
were up slightly. The average yield for a one-year
broker-sold CD was 8.19%. The only significant increase was
in the two-year brokered CD average. The rise, however,
resulted from the high rate of 8.75% offered by Shearson
Lehman Hutton.
   Meanwhile, average yields on most large-denomination CDs,
which typically require minimum deposits of $90,000 or more,
were unchanged in the shorter-term maturities, and up only
slightly in the longer maturities.
