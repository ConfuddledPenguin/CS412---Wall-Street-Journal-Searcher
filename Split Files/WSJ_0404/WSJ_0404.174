   Olympia Broadcasting Corp. reported an $11 million net
loss for 1989, compared with year-earlier profit, and said it
is seeking buyers for its radio stations.
   The Seattle broadcasting concern said the loss for the
year included $1.1 million in nonrecurring corporate expenses
and a $3.3 million charge to reflect the write-down of its
Alaska radio stations.

   The net loss was equal to $4.57 a share. For 1988, Olympia
had net income of $10.3 million, or $4.28 a share. Revenue
increased 17% to $15.8 million from $13.6 million in 1988.
   The company didn't elaborate on its announcement to sell
its radio stations, and executives weren't available for
comment. In addition to its two stations in Anchorage and
Fairbanks, the company owns stations in greater Kansas City;
Fresno, Calif.; and Spokane, Wash. It said it would sell the
stations as a group or individually.
