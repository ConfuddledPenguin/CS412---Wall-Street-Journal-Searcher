   PARIS -- French government forecasters expect the
country's real gross domestic product to rise by 3.2% in 1990
and 2.8% in 1991 after a 3.7% increase in 1989, the Economics
Ministry said.
   The forecast, which was made by the National Accounts
Commission and is used by the government in working up its
annual draft budget, represents an upward revision from the
1990 growth estimate of 3% that was made by the body last
September.
