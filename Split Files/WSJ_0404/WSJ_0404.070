   Wall Street's biggest investment bankers are writhing
after the collapse of junk bonds and megamergers, but many
regional investment firms are on a roll. And that's good news
for entrepreneurs who rely on the regionals to arrange and
finance acquisitions and other strategic deals.
   Not long ago, Wall Street investment bankers routinely
sniffed at small companies; many still do. So when Bradley S.
Scott was looking to sell his Los Angeles Auto Salvage Inc.
last year, he retained Sutro &amp; Co., a West Coast firm.
"There's a great deal of hand-holding that goes on in selling
a company, and it was important to me to have the kind of
close contact that I got with Sutro," says Mr. Scott, whose
company sold for less than $20 million.
   A plethora of such small transactions is adding up to real
money, say regional bankers happily removed from Wall
Street's slump. "I go to cocktail parties, and the Wall
Street guys say it's tough out there, and we say it's great,"
says Lloyd Greif, vice chairman of Sutro.
   The regionals' bread and butter is deals between smaller
companies. And with smaller companies thriving, many
regionals' business has never been better. Likewise, because
few big deals are getting done and so much attention is being
focused on the smaller transactions, it's a seller's market
for middle-market companies, whose annual sales fall anywhere
between $10 million and $300 million. Even at some regional
firms still in the doldrums, things are looking up.
   Only last month, Advest Group Inc., Hartford, Conn.,
completed a $10 million convertible-debenture offering for
O'Brien Energy Systems Inc., Philadelphia. The offering,
originally set for $25 million, was to have been co-managed
by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. But Drexel's parent, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Group Inc., filed for bankruptcy-law
protection Feb. 13 and has said it plans to liquidate its
assets.
   "We were able to go back to the client and say we'd like
to continue to perform on this," Allen Weintraub, Advest's
president, says. "That's proof that things can be done
regionally, even when your New York partner is unable."
   Doing things regionally has never been more lucrative,
many investment bankers say. Sutro's corporate-finance
activity, for example, has grown rapidly -- to 19
transactions last year totaling $1.47 billion from 11 in 1987
totaling $263 million. With Wall Street now averse to high
leverage and high risk, the mergers and other transactions
still getting done are generally below $250 million in value.
"That's right up the regionals' alley," Mr. Greif says.
   To be sure, not all regionals are seeing their business
mushroom; among other reasons, some firms have strong
competition in their regions, and in some parts of the
country, such as the Southwest, the economy is relatively
sluggish.
   "I guess it's going to be another slow year. I don't think
we're going to shoot the lights out," says James C. Bradford
Jr., senior partner of J.C. Bradford &amp; Co., Nashville, Tenn.
William Blair &amp; Co., Chicago, hasn't seen the kind of merger
and acquisition activity it had before the October 1987
stock-market crash. "It's clearly a slow period, and we hope
the future is going to be better," says David Coolidge,
partner in charge of corporate finance.
   Regionals -- which normally are based well outside New
York and concentrate on clients close to home -- promote
themselves as being more attuned to the needs of small
clients than is Wall Street. "The regionals are closer to the
businesses that are doing the transactions, not only
geographically but also in temperament," says Richard
Himelfarb, executive vice president of Legg Mason Wood Walker
Inc., a Baltimore concern that does transactions in the $10
million to $100 million range.
   The top people at regional firms routinely pay personal
attention to clients. "In New York, they'll get a junior man
working on their case," says Chris Covington, a partner of
Volpe, Covington &amp; Welty, a 50-person San Francisco firm.
"Here, they get a senior person laboring in the fields with
them."
   Nevertheless, it can take considerable salesmanship for a
regional firm to attract business. "Frankly, I think clients
are still overly in love with New York, and they don't really
understand why that's not necessarily the best place for them
to do their business," says R. Hunt Greene, managing director
of Piper Jaffray Inc., Minneapolis. "We spend a lot of time
educating them about our track record," which includes
financing work done for St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul,
Minn., and the current sale of Deltak Corp., Minneapolis.
   Wall Street's preoccupation with huge transactions has
given the regionals a clear-cut advantage in the current
market, Mr. Greene says. Though trying to shore up business
now, the Wall Street firms still generally neglect the middle
market. "The result is that we've had a wide-open field," Mr.
Greene says of the regionals.
   Moreover, as Wall Street lays off investment bankers in
droves, many of the regional firms are seizing the moment to
improve their own staffs. Sutro plans to add at least seven
new professionals this year to its corporate-finance offices
in San Francisco and Los Angeles, a 50% increase. "This
expansion is warranted -- in fact, necessitated -- by the
current surge in middle-market transactions that we are
experiencing," Mr. Greif says.
   The firms that are doing well aren't being bashful about
it. If they seem a tad boastful these days, it's because many
of them spent most of the past decade watching from afar as
the big firms feasted on the fattest deals. "The business
boom that went on on Wall Street didn't materialize to the
same degree in the regions," says Jim Pierpont, senior vice
president, corporate finance, at Minneapolis-based Dain
Bosworth Inc., which had "a flurry" of new business in the
first quarter.
   Despite the strong business for most regional firms, many
concede that the Wall Street giants could yet emerge as
powerful new competitors for regional business.
   "We lost a plain-vanilla private placement to a New York
house just four weeks ago," says one executive of a
Midwestern regional firm, noting that the $10 million
transaction couldn't have generated more than $60,000 in fees
-- small potatoes for a big firm. "They actually flew in from
New York to this backwater city," he says. "Since they aren't
doing the big deals, they've got to do something."
