   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
heading into the second quarter, traditionally a sluggish
oil-demand period, with production still rising.
   As a result, questions are rising over the direction of
petroleum prices over the next few weeks. If OPEC doesn't cut
production soon, analysts say, oil inventories will rise and
prices could fall.

   March production was at or near 24 million barrels a day,
topping February production and the highest level in eight
years, according to new estimates from those who monitor OPEC
output. And there are few signs that the pace will slow this
month.
   On the contrary, trackers of oil tankers said yesterday
that vessel charterings for April loadings in the Persian
Gulf are near a three-year peak. That, they said, suggests
higher OPEC output for the month. Also, leading OPEC members
recently offered steep discounts to some customers to hold or
expand sales volumes.
   "OPEC producers have now reached the threshold where
continued overproduction could push {their} basket price
below $18 {a barrel} during the seasonally lowest point of
demand over the next two months," OPEC Listener, an industry
analysis service, reported. "But all signs point to
production staying near 24 million barrels a day in April,"
added Cristina Haus, an OPEC Listener analyst.
   OPEC's high production already has led to some weakening
in oil markets, with prices down as much as $3 a barrel since
the first of the year. While oil analysts generally agree
with OPEC economists that rebounding demand will lead to
firmer prices in the second half, most industry officials
look for more softening over the next few weeks. The debate
is over how much further prices may fall.
   Price projections of Edward N. Krapels, president of a
Washington-based firm which monitors oil supplies world-wide,
fall in the middle of the range. "We don't think it {the
price outlook} will get much worse," he said. For the U.S.
benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, he sees $20 a
barrel as the floor. But he believes Dubai, an important
Middle East crude, could go below $15.
   In U.S. futures trading yesterday, West Texas Intermediate
for May delivery settled at $20.30 a barrel, down 18 cents.
On European spot markets, meantime, April and May cargos of
Dubai were unchanged from day-earlier levels of $15.60 and
$15.65 a barrel, according to the Dow Jones International
Petroleum Report.
   The Paris-based International Energy Agency was among
those issuing new estimates yesterday on OPEC production. In
its latest report, the IEA placed March OPEC output at 23.7
million barrels a day, unchanged from February. Several other
March production estimates from industry sources, including
the OPEC Listener, were higher, averaging some 24 million
barrels a day.
   Even the IEA report suggested the beginning of a buildup
in oil inventories. It showed that total inventories in the
24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development were some 450 million tons on April 1, up nine
million tons from a year earlier. Each ton contains about
seven barrels of oil.
   The IEA said that because of expected increases in demand
over the like 1989 periods these inventories are equal to 97
days of forward consumption, about the same as a year
earlier. But the latest tabulation of oil inventories by Mr.
Krapels' Washington firm of Energy Security Analysis, at the
end of February, showed 4.05 billion barrels of oil in
storage world-wide, some 80 million barrels above the
year-earlier level.
   Industry statistics also are showing rising inventories of
crude oil in the U.S. According to the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly report released late yesterday, these
inventories totaled 362.8 million barrels Friday, up 4.3
million barrels from a week earlier.
   Oil traders said the increase, which was much larger than
expected, could be bearish for petroleum markets today. But
they said this could be offset by the bigger-than-expected
decline of 7.1 million barrels in gasoline inventories last
week.
