   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Cominco Ltd.'s controlling
shareholder said it plans an offer to acquire the balance of
Cominco's affiliate, Pine Point Mines Ltd., for 50 Canadian
dollars (US$42.81) a share, or about C$126 million (US$107.9
million).
   Closely held Nunachiaq Inc., which owns more than 40% of
Cominco, a mining concern, said it entered a related lock-up
agreement with Sprott Securities Ltd. of Toronto, under which
Sprott plans to tender about 1.82 million Pine Point shares
to the proposed bid.

   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Pine Point
shares jumped C$4.75, to close at C$48.25.
   Pine Point, which owns 45% of the Polaris lead and zinc
mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, has about 4.6 million
shares outstanding, of which Cominco owns about 2.1 million.
   Vancouver-based Teck Corp., which owns 50% of Nunachiaq,
said in January it was considering making an offer for Pine
Point's minority-held shares, but it subsequently backed off.
Teck didn't disclose a proposed bid, though it said it
considered the offer after a broker it wouldn't identify
approached Teck about buying a large block of Pine Point
shares.
   Metallgesellschaft AG of West Germany and M.I.M. Holdings
Ltd. of Australia, both large mining concerns, also hold
interests in Nunachiaq.
   Nunachiaq said the bid will be mailed to Pine Point
holders when certain legal documents are completed. The bid
is conditional on Nunachiaq's acquiring at least 90% of Pine
Point's shares outstanding, other than those held by Cominco,
the company said.
