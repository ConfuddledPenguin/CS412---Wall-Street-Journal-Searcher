   AKRON, Ohio -- Telxon Inc. said special charges of $10
million to $13 million in the fiscal fourth quarter will
produce a net loss for the fiscal year of 80 cents to $1.05 a
share.
   The producer of hand-held computer systems said management
"is comfortable with" analyst estimates that Telxon will earn
a profit of 50 cents to 55 cents a share for fiscal 1991.

   In fiscal 1989, Telxon earned $15.4 million, or $1.17 a
share, including a tax credit of $499,000, or four cents a
share.
   The company said the charges in the latest quarter, which
ended March 31, include a pretax loss of $2.1 million on sale
of its Information Management Group unit, and a $3.5 million
write-off of related capitalized software. The unit is being
purchased by a company formed by Richard C. Calcaterra, who
is resigning as Telxon's marketing vice president, Telxon
said.
   Sales in fiscal 1990 were between $141 million and $144
million, the company said, down from $159.6 million a year
earlier. For fiscal 1991, volume is expected to rise to
between $160 million and $165 million, said Raymond D. Meyo,
Telxon president and chief executive officer.
   Restructuring efforts begun last September have produced a
positive cash flow for the last two quarters, Mr. Meyo said,
increasing the company's cash to more than $52 million, from
$45 million. During the period, receivables have been reduced
to about 90 days of sales, from 126 days, he said. And
inventories have been cut to $37 million, from $43 million.
