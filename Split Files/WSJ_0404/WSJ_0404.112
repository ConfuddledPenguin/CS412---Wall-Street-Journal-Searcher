   HILTON HOTEL Corp. (Beverly Hills, Calif.) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it reaffirmed its ratings on a variety of
debt related to this hotel concern, following the company's
decision last month to take itself off the auction block. The
rating concern didn't specify the total amount of debt
affected. S&amp;P had placed Hilton's direct and indirect debt
under review in June 1989, after the company announced plans
for the sale. The resulting bids fell well short of
speculation that Hilton would attract a price of $5 billion
or more, and Hilton halted the auction. S&amp;P affirmed ratings
of double-A-minus on Hilton senior debt, Hilton New Jersey
Corp. senior debt, International Leisure Corp. senior secured
debt, and single-A-1-plus on Waldorf-Astoria Corp. commerical
paper. All of the securities are guaranteed by Hilton Hotel
Corp.
