   PICKERINGTON, Ohio -- R.G. Barry Corp. said it halted
manufacturing operations at a factory in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico, because of excessive employee turnover.
   The producer of washable slippers and other comfort
footwear said it expects to incur costs of about $700,000 in
the closing, which affected about 200 employees.

   "We haven't been able to hire, train or retain enough
people to allow our plant to operate at a reasonable cost
level or near its capacity," said Gordon Zacks, chairman and
chief executive officer.
   The company said it can meet its requirements at its other
facilities, including two plants in Mexico, one in China and
three in the U.S.
