   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Daimler-Benz AG might in the
near future invite Japan's Mitsubishi group of companies to
join its planned aircraft engines joint venture with the
Pratt &amp; Whitney subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.,
Daimler's chairman said in an interview to be published
today.
   The chairman of West Germany's largest industrial company
didn't indicate with which Mitsubishi concern he has
discussed the venture.

   Edzard Reuter told the West German financial newspaper
Handelsblatt that it is "thinkable, though not completely
discussed" that Mitsubishi could join the arrangement under
which the civilian jet engine operations of Daimler's MTU
Motoren- und Turbinen-Union Muenchen G.m.b.H. engine
subsidiary will be merged with those of Pratt &amp; Whitney.
Daimler and United Technologies will then take cross
shareholdings in those respective units.
   Separately, the Deutsche Aerospace AG division of Daimler
said it signed a memorandum of understanding to sell two of
its defense related business lines to the West German
shipbuilding group Bremer Vulkan AG for an amount that wasn't
disclosed.
   The agreement ends nearly seven months of uncertainty over
the fate of these naval and missile technology operations
that were ordered by the Economics Ministry to be divested on
antitrust grounds following Daimler's acquisition of
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. last year.
