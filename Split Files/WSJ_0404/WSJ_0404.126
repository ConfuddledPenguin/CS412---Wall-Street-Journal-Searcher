   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- Waste Management Inc. and Jefferson
Smurfit Corp. dropped plans to form a joint venture under
which the waste-handling concern would have provided used
paper to Smurfit's extensive reclamation operation.
   Both companies said the plan was scuttled on an amicable
basis after they couldn't come to terms. They declined to
elaborate.

   In January, the companies signed a letter of intent
calling for Waste Management to buy a 50% stake in Smurfit's
reclamation division. Smurfit, a St. Louis container company
owned by Jefferson Smurfit Group PLC of Ireland and an
investor group led by Morgan Stanley Group Inc., is the
nation's largest reclaimer and recycler of wastepaper.
   The proposed venture had promised Smurfit an abundant and
steady stream of material, while providing an ensured market
for the old newspapers that Waste Management, the nation's
largest collector of municipal garbage, picks up from 190
municipalities in North America.
   Although the venture has been called off, the companies
said that "subject to market conditions" they expect to
continue their current relationship, in which Smurfit
sometimes buys or brokers waste paper from Waste Management.
   A Waste Management spokesman said the company is "as
optimistic as ever, and as committed as ever, to developing
endmarkets for all the recyclables we collect." The company
is pushing ahead plans to put together, with Du Pont Co., the
nation's largest plastics recycling and reprocessing
operation. "We hope to to be doing other things on our own to
provide assured outlets for what we collect," said the
spokesman.
