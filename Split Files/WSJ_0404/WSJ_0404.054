   WASHINGTON -- On Feb. 1, a group identifying itself as
"Nevadans for Fair Fuel Economy Standards" sent more than
10,000 letters urging Nevada residents to write Democratic
Sen. Richard Bryan to oppose the stricter fuel-economy
standards he was advocating as part of the overhaul of
clean-air legislation.
   At the same time, letters from "West Virginians for Fair
Fuel Economy Standards" were blanketing Democratic Sen. Jay
Rockefeller's state, in an effort to blunt his support for
the stricter fuel standards.

   The letter-writing ploy was part of a multimillion-dollar
lobbying effort waged by the auto industry over clean-air
legislation. Although none of the recipients could tell from
the letterheads, the real sponsors of the campaign were the
Big Three auto makers. They jointly hired a Washington
consulting firm to direct a so-called "grass-roots" lobbying
campaign against Sen. Bryan's fuel-economy-standards
amendment, which was ultimately dropped from the clean-air
bill.
   Other industry coalitions, including chemical
manufacturers and utilities, conducted parallel efforts aimed
at provisions of the legislation that affected them. More
than 150 different organizations and law firms registered to
lobby on the issue, making this one of the most heavily
lobbied pieces of legislation in the 101st Congress.
   Campaign contributions were among the potent weapons in
industry's clean-air lobbying arsenal. Industries involved in
the clean-air fight have such diverse legislative interests
that their political-action committees and executives are
usually active contributors. But there are signs that the
clean-air legislation prompted heavier-than-usual campaign
giving.
   "There was so much money on all sides," says Rep. Mike
Synar (D., Okla.), who sits on the House energy panel that
was the focus of much of the lobbying activity. "We're
talking about lobbyists who have put their kids through
school on this issue we've been dealing with it so long."
   The auto industry put on a showcase effort. While Chrysler
Corp., Ford Motor Co., and General Motors Corp. each
maintains a large Washington office staffed with professional
lobbyists, the companies added extra heft with outside
lawyers and consultants. Ford, for example, called on former
Transportation Secretary William Coleman, now a partner at a
Washington law firm, and Lloyd Cutler, the Democratic lawyer
who was White House counsel during the Carter administration.
   Some of the lobbying itself became controversial. Sen.
Bryan accused the auto makers of coming into his state "under
false colors" in their letter-writing campaign. William
Noack, a spokesman for GM, defended the effort as "a very
straightforward, aboveboard educational program."
   The highly technical nature of most of the clean-air
provisions drew particularly intensive lobbying, much like a
piece of major tax legislation, according to several Capitol
Hill staff members. Rep. Synar believes there was so much
lobbying on all sides "that it all tended to cancel each
other out."
   Nobody knows how much was spent on clean-air lobbying and
nobody ever will, since lobbyists are required only to make
limited disclosures of their fees. But it almost certainly
involved tens of millions of dollars. Just one
utility-lobbying coalition, Citizens for Sensible Control of
Acid Rain, reported collecting more than $500,000 from
industry executives for its 1989 efforts, according to the
group's lobbying disclosure.
   "This was the Super Bowl of lobbying," says Zoe Schneider,
who lobbied on clean air for the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, a group affiliated with consumer activist
Ralph Nader.
   It was also a superbowl for campaign fund-raising. In
1989, a year in which he didn't face an election, Sen. Carl
Levin (D., Mich.) collected $72,000, mainly from auto-related
political-action committees, industry executives and others
involved in the clean-air fight. In December, 16 Chrysler
executives ponied up $500 a head at an industry fund-raiser
hosted by Chairman Lee Iacocca at the Detroit Club. Sen.
Levin, in a tough battle for re-election this year, was the
auto industry's point man on clean air.
   William Blacklow, a spokesman for Sen. Levin, says his
boss's stands on clean air had nothing to do with his
campaign contributions. "The reverse is true," says Mr.
Blacklow, "they contribute because of his stands. Levin is
nobody's man but his own." The senator's campaign manager,
Gordon Kerr, says Mr. Iacocca was a longtime supporter of the
senator and was a co-chairman of his 1984 campaign. Sen.
Levin's auto-industry contributions were also a small
percentage of the $2.7 million he raised for his re-election
war chest last year.
   According to a recent study by Congressional Quarterly,
members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee collected
more than $600,000 from political-action committees sponsored
by 110 industries involved in the clean-air fight. This
represented a 55% increase above the amounts these same
lawmakers received in 1987, the last non-election year.
   Rep. Synar, a member of the panel who doesn't accept PAC
contributions, says such contributions "do not buy amendments
or votes. They buy access." However, the Oklahoma Democrat
said nobody needed to buy access on the clean-air bill.
"Members were diligently trying to hear from all sides
anyway."
