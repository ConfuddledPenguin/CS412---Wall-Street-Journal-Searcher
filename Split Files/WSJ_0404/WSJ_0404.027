   DAVIS, Calif. -- Calgene Inc. said it signed an agreement
with Japan's Sakata Seed Corp. to genetically engineer
disease resistance in a Sakata vegetable line. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The project is designed to reduce or eliminate fungicides
used on vegetable crops for certain diseases, Calgene said.
