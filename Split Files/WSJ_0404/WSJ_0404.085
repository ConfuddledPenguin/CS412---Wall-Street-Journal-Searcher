   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Who will be the next leader of
Indonesia? It is the question inside Indonesia these days.
   But outside Indonesia, the question often becomes: Who
cares? That's because Indonesia, after 45 years of
independence, remains perhaps the world's most nebulous
nation.

   Indonesians began thinking about a new leader after
President Suharto, who was elected to a five-year term in
1988, hinted that he might step down at the end of his term
in 1993, when he will be 72. But so far, they don't seem to
have warmed to the idea of anyone else in particular taking
over. After a quarter-century of quiet economic development
under Suharto -- helped by hefty oil-export earnings --
Indonesians believe they are approaching the economic
"take-off" stage and wonder where it will take them.
   Many foreigners don't know where Indonesia is going
either. In fact, they don't know where Indonesia is. They
often confuse it with Indochina. Foreign Affairs, the Council
on Foreign Relations' quarterly publication, headlined its
latest article about the place "Invisible Indonesia."
   Fifteenth-century Europeans knew it better. Indonesia,
then called the Spice Islands, is where Columbus was trying
to go when he bumped into America.
   Today, with 178 million people, it is the fifth largest
nation in the world, after China, India, the Soviet Union and
the U.S. It has the world's biggest population of Moslems,
who make up roughly 90% of the population.
   Indonesia ranks 15th in the world in land area. But one
thing that makes Indonesia less noticeable abroad is that it
is scattered over 13,667 islands and parts of islands,
including three of the world's six largest islands: New
Guinea (which is bigger than Texas), Borneo (bigger than
France) and Sumatra (bigger than California). Placed over a
map of North America, Indonesia would stretch from Alaska to
New York.
   Only China and India surpass it in Asia, population-wise,
and as a big potential marketplace and labor source. But much
of China's glow was tarnished at Tiananmen Square last June.
And India sputters along in its mire of red tape. Indonesia,
meanwhile, looks bright in comparison, so businesses eager to
expand in Asia care very much about who leads Indonesia next.
   Diplomats and geostrategic thinkers certainly care. They
remember when Indonesia, under the rule of the flamboyant
Sukarno and containing the world's third largest Communist
Party, was a major source of instability in the region.
   Suharto's New Order regime changed all that. It was born
in trauma Oct. 1, 1965, when an attempted coup within the
army was put down by Suharto and other generals in a
countercoup that turned into ethnic, religious and political
violence that killed hundreds of thousands of Indonesians --
many of them ethnic Chinese. More than 100,000 suspected
Communists were jailed or exiled to island prisons.
   "What Suharto did was to put this place on the shelf for
25 years," says a Western diplomat. Suharto stopped shoving
Indonesia's weight around in the region -- with the exception
of its annexation of Portuguese Timor in 1975-76, for which
it continues to be condemned by human-rights groups -- and
became a moderating influence in the Non-Aligned Movement and
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Suharto's focus was on internal development, especially in
rural areas where 80% of the population lives. He built roads
and irrigation projects, stressed food production and family
planning. Some Western diplomats in Jakarta say Suharto is
enormously popular in the countryside, so much so that he
would win a direct election for president. But Indonesians
vote indirectly, electing members of a parliament who, along
with members the president chooses in equal number, pick the
next president. The system is stacked to favor the incumbent.
   Ask middle-class Indonesians in urban areas what kind of
successor they want and one often hears, "Someone just like
Suharto," though they sometimes add, "but without his kids."
Suharto's children -- and allegations of them using their
influence to accumulate business networks and enormous wealth
-- run a close second to the succession itself as topics on
the Jakarta cocktail circuit.
   Western-educated technocrats -- who have had a largely
free rein unique in the developing world to run the economy
and plan development -- are in no hurry to see Suharto go. He
has protected and fostered them in ways a successor would be
hardpressed to match even if he wanted to.
   Suharto is an authoritarian ruler, a tough enforcer of
stability. He hasn't hesitated to crack down on militants on
the left or right, usually accusing them of being Communists
or radical Moslems, the twin threats to Indonesia's stability
in the Suharto lexicon. He has thus alienated students and
religious leaders, journalists and others wanting less
censorship and more due process and has been condemned by
international human-rights groups.
   It is generally agreed that the three most important
forces in the succession selection will be, first, President
Suharto himself, followed by the military and then by Golkar,
the ruling political party.
   Dozens of names have been floated. But a single man
emerges. Born in a poor village in central Java, son of a
minor irrigation official, he chose a military career and
rose through the ranks. He emerged as a patriot with a strong
religious faith who carried on as a respected politician,
quietly helping his nation prosper.
   His name is mentioned favorably by government officials,
businessmen, young intellectuals, religious leaders,
technocrats and villagers. That name is Suharto.
   "You had FDR I, FDR II and FDR III," says a think-tank
scholar in the Indonesian capital. "Why can't we have Suharto
VI?" Yet to this scholar, that is a distasteful thought. The
longer Suharto rules, the more uncertain will be the
succession, he says. But Suharto personifies stability, just
what Indonesia needs at this stage in its development.
   Less than a year ago, Indonesia's political observers were
confident that Suharto was serving his last term. He said as
much in his autobiography, and military men were pressing for
his retirement.
   Now, the only serious question about his seeking another
term seems to be whether he will stay healthy. He's reported
to be in good health now. He plays golf regularly and travels
around Indonesia looking like an unannounced candidate. He
also made three trips abroad last year -- to the U.S., the
Soviet Union and to Japan for the funeral of Emperor
Hirohito.
