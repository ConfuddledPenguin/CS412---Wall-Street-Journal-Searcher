   WASHINGTON -- The Connecticut State's Attorney's office
confirmed it has begun a criminal investigation into
allegations that an MCI Communications Corp. lawyer and a
hired lobbyist lied to state officials.
   Last month, MCI admitted violating the state's ethics code
for lobbyists, and paid a $10,000 civil penalty and filed
amended lobbying reports under a settlement with the State
Ethics Commission. The case stemmed from two golf
tournaments, one in 1988 and the other in 1989, at a club
near Hartford. Several Connecticut lawmakers attended.

   The ethics code bars companies and lobbyists from spending
more than $50 a year on entertainment and gifts for state
officials. Typically, companies submit lobbying forms
indicating gifts and entertainment are within the limit; the
companies collect the difference between the $50 and the
actual costs from the state officials who attend the special
corporate events.
   On forms submitted to the Ethics Commission, MCI, which
had hired a Hartford lobbying firm for advice, said it spent
$49.99 for each state official both years. In the settlement,
it acknowledged that costs, including greens fees, golf
carts, prizes, food and beverages and even portions of the
salaries of MCI employees, totaled $507.78 per person in 1988
and $661.46 per person last year.
   Robert Jackson, director of external affairs at MCI's
Northeast division, said that the state had not insisted on
that type of costing in the past. Nonetheless, he said, MCI
had made enough unintentional mistakes that it decided to
"settle the case, pay a negotiated fine and get this thing
behind us." He blamed part of the problem on
miscommunications with the hired lobbying firm over whether
to include such expenses as greens fees and golf-cart rentals
in the lobbying reports, and much of the problem on a shift
in procedures and attitudes at the ethics commission.
   Mr. Jackson said he "doubted seriously that there is any
merit" to the state investigation.
