   MINNEAPOLIS -- Honeywell Inc. said it has received several
offers for its Defense and Marine Systems business but is
considering spinning the business off to shareholders.
   The controls concern first proposed disposing of the
billion-dollar business last year as part of an effort to
increase shareholder value. Although it initially was
contemplating a sale, Honeywell said yesterday that "the
environment for defense properties has changed," an apparent
indication that early bids have been disappointingly low.

   Accordingly, a tax-free spinoff to shareholders is under
consideration, along with a sale, which the company noted
likely would result in a taxable gain. Honeywell said it
expects to dispose of the business during the current
quarter, which ends June 30.
   Defense and Marine, a leading supplier of torpedoes and
other weaponry to the U.S. and other governments, last year
earned $53.8 million on sales of $1.1 billion. Honeywell's
latest annual report, covering 1989, treats Defense and
Marine as a discontinued business.
