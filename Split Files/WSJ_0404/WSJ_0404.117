   As evidence that the collapse of Japanese stock prices and
rising Japanese interest rates is starting to hit home,
Moody's Investors Service Inc. yesterday warned that many
Japanese banks were likely to experience weak earnings and
deteriorating asset quality.
   The problems could have broad implications because
Japanese banks are large lenders in the U.S. and borrow in
the U.S. commercial paper market. In addition, Japan's banks
take short-term deposits here and often guarantee debt
offerings by nonprofit entities such as U.S. municipalities
and American universities.

   Specifically, the rating agency yesterday downgraded the
rating of the Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co. Ltd. to single-A-1
from double-A-3 "as a result of its continuing concern about
the exposure of Yasuda and other Japanese trust banks to
Japan's domestic real estate market, particularly in light of
the recent stock market decline and interest rate hikes."
   The ratings of Yasuda's short-term deposits and commercial
paper remain unchanged at Prime-1. Moody's also downgraded to
single-A-1 the senior debt rating of Yasuda's guaranteed
subsidiary, Yasuda Trust &amp; Finance (Hong Kong) Ltd. About
$2.3 billion in long-term obligations are affected by the
rating changes, Moody's said.
   Over the past decade Japanese banks have captured a
significant chunk of the U.S. loan market, to where they are
estimated to hold roughly 10% of all U.S. banking assets.
   But the combination of lower credit ratings, weak earnings
and potential problems meeting international capital adequacy
standards could reduce Japanese banks' competitiveness in
international markets.
   "Whatever is happening in Tokyo is improving the
competitive situation of U.S. banks," said Robert Dugger,
chief economist for the American Bankers Association in
Washington.
   In January, the rating agency lowered ratings on several
other Japanese banks, including Mitsubishi Trust Banking
Corp., Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking Co. and Mitsui Trust &amp;
Banking Co. At the time, Moody's also said it acted out of
growing concern about Japan's domestic real-estate market.
   "Many Japanese banks face significant earnings pressure
from rising interest rates because they typically carry
significant interest rate mismatches," said Moody's. "The
threat of asset-quality deterioration in domestic real estate
and related loan portfolios continues to be the Japanese
banks' area of greatest exposure." A mismatch is when a
bank's cost of funds is higher than the interest rate it
receives on loans.
   After hitting a record high at the end of last year, the
Nikkei index of 225 leading companies listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange has plunged 26%. Also, three-month
yen-dominated certificates of deposits have climbed to 7.52%
from 6.91% at the end of last year, according to Salomon
Brothers Inc. Yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds
have risen 22%, to where the benchmark 10-year bond now
yields 6.83% on a semi-annual basis, compared with 5.58% at
year end.
   Despite yesterday's warning, Moody's said that the
fundamental strength of Japanese banks rated by the agency is
still on a par with similarly rated banks from other
countries. Thus, Moody's said that only selective rating
adjustments of Japanese banks are likely.
   Nonetheless, the agency said that the fall in Japanese
stocks represents the end of a period of excess liquidity in
Japan's financial markets. For years, huge pools of cash were
generated by an extraordinarily easy Japanese monetary
policy. This liquidity, along with Japan's huge trade
surpluses, a high savings rate and solid corporate profits,
were major factors that fueled the Japanese real-estate and
stock market boom during the late 1980s.
   Though real-estate prices haven't fallen nearly as steeply
as share prices, U.S. and other Western analysts have long
worried about the links between the two markets. Over the
past decade, Japanese banks made loans to corporate and
individual investors who used their property holdings as
collateral. The investors then often used the loans' proceeds
to buy stocks.
   Now analysts fear that falling equity prices could drag
down the real-estate market, damaging the quality of the
collateral and other loans banks made to finance real- estate
acquisition and development.
   Japanese bankers have protested that Moody's doesn't fully
understand the Japanese real-estate market and is evaluating
that market from the perspective of the difficulties American
banks have had in the U.S. property market.
   "I agree that there is risk in real estate, but the
history of delinquencies and writeoffs doesn't warrant a
downgrading," Hiromasa Yakushiji, general manager of Sumitomo
Trust's New York branch, said recently. "No one can argue
that if the real-estate market in Japan collapses, the trust
banks will be hurt the most. But if this happens, they may
have to downgrade Japan as well."
   Nonetheless, some analysts contended that difficulties
with their real-estate portfolios won't be the only problems
Japan's banks face. Rising domestic interest rates also
threaten to cut into their trading profits.
   In addition, falling stock prices threaten to erode
Japanese banks' capital bases. That's because under
international capitaladequacy standards, the banks can count
45% of the unrealized gains on their vast equity holdings in
Japanese corporations toward their capital calculations. Much
of this stock was purchased years ago at very low prices.
   At the same time, between 30% and 40% of the assets of
Japan's big banks are denominated in foreign currencies,
particularly the dollar, which has risen nearly 11% against
the yen since mid-February. Thus, as the dollar or European
currencies rise, it becomes harder for Japan's banks to meet
their capital ratios, because the assets -- which are are
measured in yen -- grow larger. Worsening capital-asset
ratios, in turn, could force the banks to slow their asset,
or loan, growth.
   Of course, the banks could issue additional equity to
build more capital, but the Japanese stock market currently
is a very inhospitable place.
