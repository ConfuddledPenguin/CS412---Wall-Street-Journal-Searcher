   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., a distant third in the orange juice
wars, is reformulating and renaming its ailing Citrus Hill
brand.
   P&amp;G this month will replace its Citrus Hill Select with
Citrus Hill Fresh Choice, with the pitch that it is made from
oranges that are "picked and squeezed" the same day.

   By restaging the brand, analysts say, P&amp;G hopes to compete
with the premium, not-from-concentrate juices made by
industry leaders Tropicana, a brand of Seagram Co., and
Minute Maid, a brand of Coca-Cola Foods, a unit of Coca-Cola
Co.
   P&amp;G's new juice, which the company promises will be
fresher tasting, is still made from a concentrate.
   Industry analysts question whether the reformulated juice
will help the brand or just confuse consumers. "Juice is
either from a concentrate or it isn't," says Tom Pirko,
president of Bevmark Inc., a management consulting firm.
"Trying to take some in-between position will be tough."
   What is more, Mr. Pirko adds, "I'm not certain they can
revive {Citrus Hill} without a real product innovation."
   But a P&amp;G spokeswoman contends "we've found a better way
to make a better tasting juice."
   Most consumers drink orange juice that is made from
concentrates, but premium juices have helped Tropicana gain
market share. At year end, Tropicana led the market with
about $895 million in manufacturer sales. Minute Maid had
$890 million and Citrus Hill had just $270 million, according
to Beverage Marketing Corp. in New York.
   The so-called premium juices are made by squeezing the
oranges and processing the juice. In concentrates, the water
is drawn out of the juice after the fruit is squeezed and
added again later. Juices made from concentrates are
generally lower priced.
   P&amp;G has tried several strategies with its Citrus Hill
brand, including introduction of a calcium-enriched orange
juice three years ago, but that hasn't made a big difference.
   The brand doesn't have the name recognition of Tropicana
or Minute Maid, but it is higher priced than store brands.
   Along with a new name and formula, P&amp;G also is changing
the juice's packaging. The company recently received a patent
for a carton that has a resealable spout.
   The new juice recently was introduced in several Northeast
and West Coast test markets. P&amp;G officials won't say whether
the product will go nationwide. The price of the juice will
be similar to the existing Citrus Hill Select.
