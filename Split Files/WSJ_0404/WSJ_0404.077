   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. management mailed a
proxy statement to shareholders challenging the credentials
of the principals of Centaur Partners IV, who are waging a
proxy fight for control of National Intergroup.
   "Abbey Butler, Melvyn Estrin and Charles Abod have no
proven track record in running a large, diversified public
company," National Intergroup said. National said that a
mail-order company operated by Mr. Butler went bankrupt in
1978 and that Mr. Butler has twice filed for personal
bankruptcy, in 1981 and 1983.

   In addition, Mr. Butler was censured and fined by the
National Association of Securities Dealers for rules
violations, National Intergroup said.
   Centaur, which owns more than 16% of National, is
advocating sale of the assets of the drug wholesaling
concern, which has interests in metals and energy companies.
   In New York, Centaur Partners Group said National
Intergroup's management and directors "have resorted to
personal invective and mischaracterizations in an attempt to
divert stockholder attention from their own sorry record of
$450 million in losses from continuing operations during the
last six years."
   Centaur said in a statement that the Centaur group's
ability to run a large company shouldn't be an issue "in view
of our announced program to sell National Intergroup's
businesses and distribute the proceeds to stockholders."
