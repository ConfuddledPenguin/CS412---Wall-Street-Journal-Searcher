   The world's markets are now looking ahead to this
weekend's G-7 meeting of finance ministers in Paris. Since
the first of the year, we have discussed several times the
question of the dollar's value relative to the yen and
deutsche mark. We have argued that the proper goal of
exchange-rate intervention in a global economy should be to
stabilize the world's major currencies around a reference
point called purchasing power parity. The yen has recently
moved back into the range of values we've suggested for PPP.
Whatever the G-7 officials may decide this weekend, we think
it would be helpful to examine in the charts below the paths
of these currencies, within the context of a PPP range, from
the time of the Plaza meeting in 1985.
