   Banque Bruxelles Lambert S.A. and International Aircraft
Services of Ireland said they plan to start a joint-venture
aircraft leasing company that will soon buy $500 million of
airplanes.
   The new venture, Airlease Finance Ltd., will have
headquarters in Shannon, Ireland, and manage a portfolio of
airplanes to be placed on short-term, off-balance-sheet
operating leases with airlines. BBL and IAS said they will
spell out their participation in the new venture and their
aircraft purchase plans later this month.

   BBL is Belgium's second-largest commercial bank. A
spokesman said the company got into the aircraft leasing
business six years ago with a couple of sale-leasebacks of
planes.
   Shannon-based IAS is 45%-owned by its chairman and chief
executive officer, Gerry Connolly. IAS's Shannonair unit owns
18 used Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie planes, which it has
placed on operating leases with airlines. In January, IAS
founded an an aircraft engine-leasing venture with a BAII
Bank, a Belgian banking consortium, and Potomac Investment
Co., of Washington, D.C.
