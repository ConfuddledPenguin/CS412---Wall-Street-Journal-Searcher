   WASHINGTON -- A few weeks ago, during closed-door
negotiations over the clean-air bill, Sen. John Chaffee (R.,
R.I.) agreed not to offer a tough amendment outlawing the
latest generation of ozone-depleting chemicals.
   It was the cue for David Doniger to whir into action.

   As a staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, Mr. Doniger had helped write the amendment. And
before long, the lanky, bald and bearded environmental lawyer
had helped resurrect the provision on the Senate floor, with
Sen. Al Gore (D., Tenn.) as the sponsor. It survived as part
of the Senate's clean-air bill.
   Mr. Doniger, 38 years old, is the youngest of three NRDC
lawyers whose expertise has proved indispensable in the
shaping of the Senate clean-air bill. They have won both
praise and criticism as shadow legislators -- lobbyists who
have helped to write some sections of the bill while shooting
other sections down. With the Senate bill behind them, they
switch their attention to the House, where they are likely to
have even more influence.
   The other members of this green trio are Richard Ayres,
48, who 20 years ago founded the NRDC with several Yale Law
School classmates, and David Hawkins, 47, who as a former
clean-air administrator at the Environmental Protection
Agency is the only government veteran of the three.
   Together, they represent a new breed: the public-interest
lawyer as yuppie. Operating out of a sleek downtown office
outfitted with blond wood and silver-framed prints by Folon
and Georgia O'Keefe, they take in salaries of $55,000 to
upwards of $80,000. That's less than their corporate
opponents earn, but enough to establish an air of permanence
at the organization.
   Throughout the legislative debate, the three lawyers have
peddled themselves as technicians ready to school legislators
in the unfathomable complexities of clean air. "I think they
were superb," says first-term Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.).
"They had an institutional memory that I simply couldn't
have."
   Not that the Senate bill is an environmentalists' dream.
"If signed into law, it would not solve our most pressing air
pollution problems," says Mr. Hawkins. The three lobbyists
initially supported Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
(D., Maine) on the bill, but split with him after he worked
out a compromise agreement with the White House.
   "There has been a rift of sorts," concedes Mr. Ayres, who
chairs a clean-air lobbying coalition that includes the NRDC
and the Sierra Club. Instead of Sen. Mitchell's bargaining
with the Bush administration, he says the coalition would
have preferred to whip up public support for a tougher bill.
   "The reality is that we didn't have the votes for the
bill," answers Sen. Mitchell, "and they're aware of that."
Sen. Mitchell says the trio's input on the clean-air bill is
"not helpful."
   The environmental lawyers' actions have prompted some in
the Senate to accuse them of outright petulance. Senate
Minority Whip Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) complains of their
"unrealistic expectations and huge egos," and blames the
three for holding up the progress of clean-air legislation
during the past decade.
   But Sen. Simpson also concedes their grasp of scientific
issues: "They have a great deal of knowledge to contribute
and they're very bright."
   The triumvirate hopes to do better on the House side,
where they expect to have more influence, especially with
Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), who is helping shape the bill
in the Energy and Commerce Committee. "I rely quite heavily
on them," says Rep. Waxman.
   The NRDC has little clout with other members of the Energy
and Commerce Committee. But the trio will probably have more
influence on the final House bill, says Mr. Hawkins, because
there are so many members from urban centers, where the worst
air-pollution problems occur.
   Started in a ramshackle three-room office in 1970, the
NRDC now boasts branch offices in San Francisco and Honolulu.
Despite its non-profit, tax-exempt status, the research and
advocacy group is permitted by law to lobby Congress. Its
membership totals 120,000.
