   WASHINGTON -- The House Public Works and Transportation
Committee approved legislation to require access for the
handicapped to mass transit and buses.
   The panel was the third of four House committees to pass
provisions of a wide-ranging bill that would bar
discrimination against disabled persons. The measure covers
hiring practices, access to public buildings,
telecommunications use and public transportation.

   The Labor and Commerce committees have already voted out
provisions for employment, telecommunications, Amtrak and
commuter-rail service. The Judiciary Committee is expected to
take up the public-accommodations provisions late this month.
The Senate passed its version of the bill, which generally
has Bush administration backing, last September.
   Part of "an obstacle course" faced by 43 million
handicapped persons is "a transportation network that has too
often made it difficult -- if not impossible -- for disabled
Americans to be full participants in our communities," said
Rep. Norman Mineta (D., Calif.), chairman of the surface
transportation subcommittee.
   Under the bill approved by the committee:
   -- New buses and subway trains must be accessible to the
disabled, including being equipped for boarding by
wheelchair-reliant persons.
   -- Most rebuilt mass-transit vehicles must be made
accessible, to the maximum feasible extent.
   -- New transit stations and facilities must be accessible,
while major structural work must include making stations
accessible unless that would entail an especially high cost.
Most existing "key" stations must be made accessible within
three years.
   -- Special door-to-door buses and vans, and other such
services, must be made available by public authorities to
anyone who cannot use fixed-route service. The special
operations must be comparable to the level of transit service
offered to the general public, unless that imposes an undue
financial burden.
   -- Interim rules would be issued in one year for
accessibility to intercity buses, other than for wheelchair
lifts. Final rules, possibly including rules for lifts, would
be issued in six years for large bus companies, and in seven
years for small ones.
