   Tokyo stocks finished sharply higher, a day after posting
the biggest single-day loss since the October 1987 plunge.
   The Nikkei index rebounded in the afternoon session, after
slipping in the morning. Active bargain hunting lifted the
market, with advances led by high-tech and blue-chip shares.
Trading in stocks with poor earnings outlooks remained
sluggish.

   In London, prices finished a seesaw session firmer, as an
early advance on the back of the good Tokyo performance ran
out of steam, only to be revived once Wall Street opened.
   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues finished just below its
intraday high, up 757.65 points at 28759.72. Yesterday's gain
was the index's first in six trading days. The Nikkei lost
1978.38 points, or 6.6%, Monday, the second-largest daily
loss ever both in point and percentage terms.
   In trading Wednesday morning, the Nikkei index was up
212.05 points at 28971.77.
   Volume yesterday on the first section was estimated at 650
million shares, up from 479 million shares Monday. Declining
issues outpaced advancing issues 464 to 412, while 70 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section gained 41.78 points, or 2.02%, to 2111.11,
after plunging 158.15 points Monday.
   The second section index lost 77.04 points, or 2.10%, to
3586.07. The index fell 154.79 points Monday. Volume was
estimated at nine million shares, up from five million shares
Monday.
   The Nikkei index fluctuated widely in either side of 28000
points yesterday.
   After gaining 600 points in the first 30 minutes of the
morning session, the index fell as low as 27678.18 points,
the lowest intraday level this year.
   But the index bounced up 250 points during the last 30
minutes of the morning session, cutting the loss to 77.19
points.
   Selling pressure was strong from individual investors,
some of whom need to cash in holdings to pay additional
deposits for margin buying, traders said.
   But such selling, orders for which mostly had been placed
with brokerage houses overnight, were processed during the
morning session.
   Encouraged by reduced selling pressure, the Nikkei
continued its upward move through the afternoon session.
   The Nikkei's advance didn't indicate across-the-board
gains, however.
   High-tech and blue-chip shares gained, supported by buying
by a wide range of investors including institutions and
investment trust funds, traders said.
   Meanwhile, investors sold stocks with poor earnings
prospects, regardless of their capitalization, the traders
said.
   Some speculative shares also were targets of heavy
selling. Rumors that some speculator groups are in financial
trouble spawned fear that the groups may sell their holdings,
traders said.
   Traders said life and non-life insurance companies were
among active buyers. The activity spawned speculation among
traders that the Ministry of Finance asked the companies to
place buy orders to demonstrate that a report in a leading
economic newspaper asserting the companies planned heavy
sales was misleading. Officials of life insurance companies
denied the speculation.
   Among the high-technology winners were Sony, which rose
500 yen to 8100 yen ($3.15 to $51), and Kyocera, which surged
540 yen to 7900 yen. Hitachi gained 120 yen to 1620 yen,
while Sharp increased 100 yen to 1800 yen.
   But mining issues declined, reflecting falling gold
prices, traders said. Dowa Mining lost 54 yen to 756 yen.
Petroleum shares were also sold as the weaker yen is expected
to push up oil import costs. Nippon Oil fell 40 yen to 1000
yen.
   Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said that in the week
ended March 30, the balance of margin buying declined 273.1
billion yen to 8.619 trillion yen. The balance of short
positions outstanding increased 208.6 billion yen to 663.9
billion yen.
   London equities were initially cheered by the Tokyo
market, and responded by sending the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 up about 12 points, in conjunction with some
aggressive stock-index futures buying.
   But this move wasn't to last, and with no subsequent
follow-through buying, the index drifted off by midday and
even showed a loss at one stage.
   However, a number of factors conspired during the
afternoon to drive the market higher yet again. These
included additional futures activity, a firm opening on Wall
Street, revived bid speculation in a handful of major stocks,
a firm pound and a shortage of stock among the blue chips.
   At the close, the FT-SE 100 was up 19.1 points at 2240.7
and just a shade below its 2241.7 intraday peak. The
midmorning low was 2218, which was down 3.6 points from
Monday's close.
   The Financial Times 30 share index was up 13.2 points at
1761.3. Volume amounted to a relatively good 541.8 million
shares, up from 527.4 million issues. Dealers said two
program trades accounted for much of yesterday's volume.
   Dealers said the main feature of yesterday's market was
the strength of the property market. British Land surged 34
pence to 374 pence (56 cents to $6.12), Hammerson jumped 17
pence to 763 pence, Land Securities added 11 pence to 497
pence, and MEPC gained 10 pence to 506 pence.
   Another star performer was Reuters, where the announcement
of the proposed 10% share buy-back and increased borrowing
powers was well received, after an initial sluggish response.
   Upon Wall Street's opening, dealers said they saw firm
buying interest for Reuters and the price quickly climbed,
closing at #11.43, a gain of 36 pence.
   Elsewhere, Reckitt &amp; Colman jumped 29 pence to #11.59,
continuing on the back of the SmithKline Beecham sale of
Marmite, Ambrosia and Bovril food brand names a day earlier.
Analysts said the price fetched by SmithKline Beecham for the
brand goods has led investors to reassess the value of the
many brands in Reckitt's stable.
   Cadbury Schweppes added 13 pence to 332 pence as talk
circulated that U.S. food and tobacco giant Philip Morris was
looking to diversify away from its tobacco interests and
found the British sweets and soft-drink maker enticing. The
talk went so far as to suggest that Philip Morris would be
making a bid for Cadbury sometime this week.
   Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed higher in Paris,
Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Stockholm and
lower in Milan. South African gold stocks closed marginally
firmer.
   Meanwhile, prices rose in Singapore, Hong Kong and
Wellington, were mixed in Sydney and Manila, and lower in
Seoul and Taipei.
