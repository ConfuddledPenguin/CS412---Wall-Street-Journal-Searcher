   A group that includes Bailey Financial Group Inc. and
Financial Securities Fund L.P. said it has offered to acquire
all stock outstanding of Durham Corp. for $37.50 a share.
   In a letter to Durham's chairman, the group said its offer
would provide $30 in cash and $7.50 in subordinated
debentures for each Durham common share.

   The letter was attached to a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   Officials of Durham, an insurance and broadcasting concern
based in Raleigh, N.C., couldn't be reached for comment. The
company had 8.4 million common shares outstanding as of Dec.
31
   Durham was quoted in over-the-counter trading yesterday at
$30.50 a share.
   All aspects of the offer, including the possibility of a
higher, all-cash offer, are negotiable, the group said. It
stressed its desire to conduct a review of Durham, noting
that it could raise its offer if the information justifies
doing so.
   The group said that its financial adviser, Stephens Inc.,
has demonstrated the group's financial ability to fund the
offer.
   Bailey Financial and Financial Securities are part of a
shareholder group holding a 5.9% stake in Durham's common
stock, according to a previous SEC filing.
