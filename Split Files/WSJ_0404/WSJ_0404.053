   MOSCOW -- The battle of nerves over Lithuania's
declaration of independence is giving way to more subtle
diplomatic moves as both Moscow and the rebel Baltic state
edge toward compromise.
   In the latest sign that the three-week-old deadlock is
easing, a delegation of Lithuanian leaders held talks in
Moscow last night with Alexander Yakovlev, a Politburo member
and confidant of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Details
of the discussion aren't known, but the meeting marked the
first time the two sides have sat down together since
Lithuania declared its independence March 11.

   "The most important thing is to attempt to have a
dialogue," said Egidius Bickauskas, the head of Lithuania's
representative office in Moscow, who announced that the talks
were under way.
   Following a show of strength by Moscow, which has used
troops to occupy buildings owned by the Soviet Communist
Party and round up army deserters, Lithuania says it is
anxious to defuse the crisis and negotiate a peaceful
secession from the U.S.S.R. The republic, along with its
Baltic neighbors of Latvia and Estonia, was forcibly
incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 following a secret
agreement between Stalin and Hitler.
   Despite the use of troops, the Kremlin has ruled out force
to crush the rebellion. Mr. Gorbachev himself strongly hinted
at a possible compromise in an appeal to the Lithuanian
Parliament issued on Saturday. He held out the prospect of
talks "on the entire range of problems" on condition that the
republic annuls "the illegal acts it has adopted." In
Washington, meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze said yesterday on his arrival for talks with
U.S. leaders that Moscow wants an "honest dialogue" with
Lithuania to resolve the crisis.
   But Soviet officials insist it is up to Lithuania to make
the next move. And Mr. Gorbachev is moving fast to set stiff
conditions for republics seeking to secede from the Soviet
Union. The Soviet Parliament yesterday rushed through a new
law that could stall or delay secession attempts.
   The law stipulates that a decision to secede must be taken
by a two-thirds majority of residents in the republic voting
in a referendum. If a republic clears that hurdle, the
timetable for secession must then be approved by the Soviet
Congress of People's Deputies, the highest legislative body.
The law envisages a transition period of up to five years.
   Lithuania's deputy prime minister, Romualdas Ozolas, told
reporters before meeting Mr. Yakovlev that the republic is
ready to compromise on anything except independence itself.
In his appeal, Mr. Gorbachev didn't explicitly mention
annulling the declaration of independence, which has been
ruled illegal by the Soviet Parliament. But he and other
officials have expressed public anger at a series of measures
approved by Lithuania that deliberately violate Soviet law,
including the establishment of a volunteer force and the
blacking out of some Soviet TV shows.
   The Lithuanian Parliament is expected to issue its reply
to Mr. Gorbachev's appeal today, following a rally in
Vilnius, the republic's capital. It remains unclear how
conciliatory the reply will be, and whether Lithuania is now
ready to suspend or amend some of the laws it has passed
since March 11.
   Despite its agreement to meet Lithuanian leaders, Moscow
has not yet eased the pressure it is putting on the republic.
The Tass news agency again denounced Sajudis, the Lithuanian
nationalist movement that dominates the republic's
Parliament, accusing it of using methods that run counter to
democracy and pluralism. Soviet authorities closed the
Lithuanian border to Poland. And the small Lithuanian
Communist Party that remains loyal to Moscow barred Sajudis
from continuing to use its printing presses for the
movement's four newspapers. Sajudis immediately protested
that the move violates contracts it has signed with the
Communist Party publishing house.
   Officials in the other two Baltic states, who are closely
monitoring developments in Lithuania, view the strong-arm
tactics as a warning to them not to follow Lithuania's
example. Estonia has already heeded the lesson, declaring
that it is seeking independence after a "transition period."
Latvia's Parliament is expected to discuss its own path to
independence early next month.
   Although yesterday's new law on secession passed easily,
deputies from the three Baltic states who attended the
Parliament session all abstained and several Georgians voted
against it. They said that the terms of secession should be
decided by each republic by itself and through negotiations
with Moscow, and not laid down by the Soviet legislature.
Nikolai Medvedev, a deputy from Lithuania, described the new
legislation as, "purely decorative." He added: "It's not a
law on secession, it's a law against secession."
   Representatives of the Baltic states believe that Mr.
Gorbachev, for all his bluster, will eventually have no
choice but to negotiate terms of their withdrawal from the
Soviet Union. All three republics have been at pains to use
the Soviet leader's "democracy" campaign to elect radicals to
parliament who then vote on independence. Ignoring such votes
would undermine Mr. Gorbachev's entire political reform
program, they say.
   "Sooner or later they will accept it," said Igor Gryazin,
an Estonian deputy, who handed a copy of the Estonian
Parliament's independence decision to the Kremlin yesterday.
