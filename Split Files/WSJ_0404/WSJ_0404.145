   Every so often, a reader of the New Yorker magazine gets
the idea that its writers might be stuck for good topics. At
times it seems as if the search for sentient subjects has
been abandoned altogether, in favor of inanimate objects that
can't walk, think, give interviews, or (it is hoped) sue for
libel. Who can forget E.J. Kahn's multi-parter on wheat and
corn, or John McPhee's slow-moving descriptions of glaciers?
   Just about everybody. Perhaps that's why staff writer
Janet Malcolm consistently has resisted her colleagues'
tendency to overreach -- no "Annals of Polyurethane" for her
-- and made it her specialty to underreach. As subject
matter, Janet Malcolm is never far from Janet Malcolm's
thoughts. She now has brought this self-referential art to a
kind of climax, taking as the subject of her latest
journalism nothing less than -- or rather nothing much more
than -- her feelings about the subject of journalism.

   First published as a two-parter in the New Yorker last
year and just released in book form, "The Journalist and the
Murderer" (Knopf, 162 pages, $18.95) has been a big hit among
people who enjoy reading about writers: which is to say,
writers. Her roundhouse opening sentences have been
memorized, whispered and reprinted at journalism seminars,
writing workshops, and wherever else a writer might prattle
about what he or she but no one else calls "the craft."
   The famous opening goes like this: "Every journalist who
is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is
going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He
is a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity,
ignorance, or loneliness. . . ."
   As texts for her sermon Ms. Malcolm uses a huge,
true-crime book by Joe McGinniss called "Fatal Vision," as
well as the transcript of a breach-of-contract suit brought
against Mr. McGinniss by the protagonist of "Fatal Vision," a
former Green Beret named Jeffrey MacDonald. In 1979,
MacDonald was convicted of savagely murdering his wife and
two children. Shortly before the trial, he and Mr. McGinniss
signed a contract granting the journalist free access to his
papers and defense preparation, in return for which MacDonald
was to get a cut of the book's profits.
   For some reason, Ms. Malcolm considers this relationship
paradigmatic, when in fact it is far slimier than anything
that normally obtains between journalist and subject
(especially at the New Yorker -- imagine a glacier demanding
a share of a book's profits). What particularly galls her is
that Mr. McGinniss might have deceived MacDonald into
thinking that the book was going to exonerate him, even
though Mr. McGinniss had long since concluded he was guilty.
   At least, that's what Ms. Malcolm says galls her. The book
is an extended one-woman chin wag about the propriety of
deception in reporting. But since she indulges herself in
quick and quackish psychoanalysis throughout the book, a
reader feels free to postulate his or her own theories as to
the origins of Ms. Malcolm's animus toward Joe McGinniss. She
makes some snide references, for example, to the true-crime
genre, and to the enormous popularity of Mr. McGinniss's
book. In any given week "Fatal Vision" (still in paperback)
probably sells more copies than all Ms. Malcolm's ponderous
little books have sold over the last, oh, 15 years. Mr.
McGinniss even squeezed a TV miniseries out of the thing.
Might these facts, too, gall Ms. Malcolm, just a bit? Book
writers are a competitive bunch.
   An alternative theory, much discussed in those writing
workshops, holds that Ms. Malcolm wrote this odd little book
as a rite of exculpation. The subject of one of her earlier
books sued her for libel a couple of years ago, alleging that
she fabricated quotes, misled him about her journalistic
intentions, and generally acted like "a kind of confidence
man, preying upon people's vanity, ignorance, or loneliness,"
as a guilt-ridden journalist might put it.
   Ms. Malcolm makes clear in a new afterword to "The
Journalist and the Murderer" that she is appalled by such
insinuations. She desperately wants her book to be thought
high-minded, which in a way it is -- so high-minded that she
sails over the true barbarity of the McGinniss-MacDonald
story. Mr. McGinniss's "Fatal Vision" is indeed a sleazy
book, but not because the author betrayed his subject. It's
designed to exploit the rubbernecking ghoul in all of us: The
book is so compelling because the crime was so grotesque, and
the unseemliness of anyone fattening off it is staggering.
The bludgeoning of Mrs. MacDonald and her children was the
biggest break of Joe McGinniss's career.
   Still more repulsive, of course, is MacDonald himself, but
Ms. Malcolm's strange preoccupation with her hyped-up ethical
conundrum restrains her from considering him at any length,
though she does glance up from her meditation long enough to
note his "preternatural equipoise," his gentle way with a
powdered donut, and her own "erotic" reaction to the letters
he send her. For Janet Malcolm, child-killers come and go;
the problems of journalism endure.
