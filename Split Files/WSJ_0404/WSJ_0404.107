   DETROIT -- Will the real Bob Stempel please stand up?
   That's the question at General Motors Corp. in the wake of
yesterday's announcement that Robert C. Stempel, age 56, will
become chairman and chief executive officer, effective August
1.

   The big unknown at GM is whether Mr. Stempel, who has been
president and chief operating officer since 1987, will
provide radically different leadership from his controversial
and oft-criticized predecessor, Roger B. Smith.
   The likely answer is that the style may differ
dramatically, but the direction won't. Mr. Stempel is more
comfortable in a room full of car dealers -- or in virtually
any public forum -- than Mr. Smith. But Mr. Stempel recently
told a group of United Auto Workers union local officials not
to expect any big changes in policy or direction. After all,
he said, virtually the same group of men who have led the
company for nearly three years will be running it after Mr.
Smith retires this summer.
   Such signals yesterday tempered the enthusiasm for Mr.
Stempel among GM officials who want innovative, radical
decisions on issues ranging from plant closings to cultural
change. Those managers see Mr. Stempel as a former innovator
who once bucked GM tradition to create a decentralized
management structure for the company's large-car group, and
made bold moves that helped turn GM's European operation from
a money-loser to an important profit center. But Mr. Stempel
has become markedly more cautious in recent years, these
officials add, much like a politician playing it safe with a
comfortable lead in the polls.
   "If Bob Stempel can be the guy he used to be, that will be
fabulous," said one GM vice president who, like many at the
company, believes Mr. Stempel has become overly cautious in
recent years. "The question is, did he change permanently, or
only because he had to survive in a difficult situation?"
   Mr. Stempel's appointment was expected, but it marks a
radical departure from tradition for GM. He becomes the first
engineer to lead the company, which has been run by finance
men since Charles E. "Engine Charlie" Wilson retired in 1953.
To those who often were dismayed by the quality of GM's
products in the 1980s, the accession of an executive who
knows cars and manufacturing is a positive sign.
   But in Mr. Stempel's hand-picked management team, most
executive functions are in the hands of the same individuals
who had them before.
   Two executive vice presidents, 51-year-old John F. Smith
Jr. and 59-year-old Robert J. Schultz, become vice chairmen
and directors, also effective August 1. But both men retain
their current responsibilities, with Mr. Smith responsible
for international operations and Mr. Schultz heading GM's
technical staffs and two big subsidiaries, Electronic Data
Systems Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics.
   Lloyd E. Reuss, 53, becomes president of GM. He retains
responsibility for GM's core business, North American auto
operations, and gains oversight of GM's component operations.
Unlike Mr. Stempel, however, Mr. Reuss won't be chief
operating officer with world-wide purview for all of GM's
businesses; that post will remain unfilled.
   Mr. Reuss's promotion was somewhat controversial because
the operations he has run since 1984, GM's
Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada group and more recently the North
American car business, have been the biggest sore spots at a
struggling company. But after Mr. Reuss lost the presidency
to Mr. Stempel in 1987, he took defeat with grace and became
intensely loyal to his former rival.
   In recent weeks, Mr. Stempel pushed hard for Mr. Reuss's
appointment as president. People familiar with the situation
say Mr. Stempel got his way even though some key outside
directors and Chairman Smith wanted to name John Smith
president and chief operating officer.
   The losers in GM's long-anticipated executive-suite
shuffle are three other executive vice presidents who, while
not necessarily falling back, didn't gain any ground either:
William E. Hoglund, Robert T. O'Connell and F. Alan Smith.
All three men retain their current responsibilities: Mr.
Hoglund for component operations, Mr. O'Connell for finance
and Mr. Smith for corporate staffs. (None of the three Smiths
-- Roger, John or Alan -- is related.)
   Mr. Hoglund, who turned around GM's Pontiac division in
the mid-1980s and later ran the Saturn Corp. subsidiary, is
GM's most personable and popular top executive and has a
well-known maverick streak. Many expected him to fare better
in the reshuffling, but his style may have worked against him
with a chief executive who puts a premium on loyalty and team
play.
   Mr. Stempel's promotion got a largely positive reaction
from analysts and dealers.
   "The major positive is that the board has realized that
senior management has to have operating experience, because
the problems are operational," said John Casesa, an analyst
with Wertheim, Schroder and Co.
   "Chevy dealers are going to jump on their desks and scream
applause," said Wisconsin Chevrolet dealer John Bergstrom,
former head of the division's dealer council. "I'm a real Bob
Stempel fan. He's a car man."
   Former GM director H. Ross Perot declared it "a great day
for General Motors." The Texas billionaire, who left GM's
board in controversy in 1986 and remains a company critic,
praised Mr. Stempel and his team as "strong, strong engineers
and strong leaders. I expect to see really great things."
   Investors didn't react much at all, perhaps because Mr.
Stempel wasn't a surprise choice. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, GM stock closed at $45.625 a
share, up 12.5 cents.
   "There is no higher priority in GM than increasing our
market share profitably in North America," Mr. Stempel said
at a news conference yesterday morning. During the 1980s,
GM's market share plunged more than 10 points to about 35%
last year. Mr. Reuss said yesterday that GM's goal is to
climb back to 40%, although many analysts and some GM
officials regard that as unrealistic.
   Mr. Stempel gingerly fielded questions about the record of
his predecessor, Chairman Smith, who will remain a GM
director. "I think history will show him in a favorable
light," Mr. Stempel said, "but that's the role of history to
sort that out, not the incoming chairman."
   Mr. Stempel's rise to the top at GM began in the early
1960s. He got the attention of superiors with his work on the
1966 Oldsmobile Toronado, GM's first modern front-wheel-drive
car. "That got him good visibility with the right people,"
recalled former Oldsmobile engineer Thomas Krieg.
   In 1978, Mr. Stempel's career moved into the fast lane,
landing him six different jobs in 10 years. In January 1978,
he was named GM vice president and general manager of the
Pontiac division. He became managing director of GM's Adam
Opel subsidiary in Europe in 1980. In 1982, he was back in
the U.S. as general manager of Chevrolet.
   In 1984, he was promoted to group vice president in charge
of GM's new U.S. large-car manufacturing operation, the
Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group. In 1986, he was put in
charge of GM's world-wide truck operations and its overseas
car operations. In September 1987, he became GM's president.
   It was in the two jobs before the presidency that Mr.
Stempel took the kinds of risks that some of his subordinates
want him to take again.
   At the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group, Mr. Stempel
rejected the highly centralized management structure proposed
by consultants from McKinsey &amp; Co. Instead, Mr. Stempel
heeded the advice of subordinates and created a highly
decentralized operation that in effect was a loose
affiliation of semi-autonomous, product-centered work groups.
   The decentralized system had a big payoff. At the Flint
Automotive division, for instance, what had been the old
Buick manufacturing and engineering operation became the
nucleus of an all-in-one center for building GM's largest
front-wheel-drive cars. All five of the GM cars that made
Consumer Reports magazine's most recent list of recommended
vehicles were engineered and manufactured by the Flint
Automotive division. Cadillac has also seen a dramatic
improvement in its quality since regaining control of its
manufacturing operations in January 1987, according to
internal and independent surveys.
   When he took over the truck and overseas operations in
1986, Mr. Stempel faced deeply troubled businesses.
   In Europe, Mr. Stempel set in motion plans that resulted
in the shutdown of GM's Bedford truck operations in Britain,
and a complete overhaul of passenger car manufacturing
operations. The results: Overseas auto operations have
out-earned GM's North American auto operations for three
years in a row, with last year's profits hitting a record
$2.7 billion.
   On the truck side, Mr. Stempel put the heavy truck
business into a joint venture with AB Volvo of Sweden, put a
money-losing diesel engine business into another joint
venture managed by entrepreneur Roger Penske, and encouraged
development of a new pickup that is now closing the sales gap
against Ford Motor Co. models.
   Since becoming president, however, Mr. Stempel hasn't made
any such dramatic strokes. For example, he reversed plans to
close or sell many of GM's troubled parts-making operations,
choosing to give them more time to become profitable and
competitive. And he has resisted an aggressive switch to
so-called multi-valve engines, which have been popularized by
Japanese auto makers.
   One of Mr. Stempel's first major tasks will be overseeing
the negotiation of a new contract with the United Auto
Workers union, replacing the pact that expires in September.
Job security, and specifically plant closings, looms as the
major issue, but Mr. Stempel yesterday spoke in upbeat terms
about the situation.
   "Our objective isn't to shrink the business at General
Motors," he said, "it's to grow the business."
