   INWOOD, N.Y. -- Choice Drug Systems Inc. said its
president and chief operating officer, George W. Keith,
resigned after three months, citing differences with
management.
   "It was such a vague resignation, quite frankly, that"
today "we're having a board meeting to find out why" Mr.
Keith left, said Frank Mandelbaum, executive vice president,
treasurer and chief financial officer of the provider of
pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and disposables on Long
Island here.

comment, Mr. Mandelbaum added. Mr. Keith couldn't be reached.
