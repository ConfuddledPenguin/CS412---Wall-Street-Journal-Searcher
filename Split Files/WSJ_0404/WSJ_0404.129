   DETROIT -- Auto makers dodged the fuel-economy bullet in
the Senate clean air bill, but they still face an all-out
legislative fight over this potentially costly issue.
   Environmentalists are pushing for improved gasoline
mileage as a key step in slowing global warming, a climatic
change that scientists have linked to the burning of gasoline
and other fossil fuels. Auto makers, meanwhile, complain that
a tough fuel economy law will force them to radically shrink
their cars at a time when consumers are buying bigger, more
powerful models.

   "The car industry is going to fight like hell, but so are
we," says Daniel Becker, director of global warming and
energy programs for the Sierra Club. "And I think Congress is
going to conclude they need to tighten up C.A.F.E. {corporate
average fuel economy}."
   The auto industry won an important skirmish when it
blocked an amendment from the Senate bill that would have
effectively required greatly improved fuel economy. Such an
amendment was GM's "No. 1 objection" to the clean air bill,
says William H. Noack, director of General Motors Corp.'s
Washington office.
   But a fight is still looming. Yesterday, the Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation
overwhelmingly approved a bill, written by Sen. Richard Bryan
(D., Nev.), that would require each manufacturer to achieve a
20% improvement in corporate fuel economy by 1995 and a 40%
improvement by 2001. The bill uses 1988 as a base.
   Approval came despite lobbying from auto industry
officials; Ford Motor Co. Chairman Harold A. Poling
personally visited four key senators before the vote. The
Bryan bill "has the potential to eliminate the family car,"
argues GM's Mr. Noack.
   Senate leadership has already promised to give the Bryan
bill time on the floor later this year. And some senators
behind the clean air bill have indicated they support tougher
fuel economy standards, not only because of global warming,
but also because of concern about the trade deficit -- caused
in no small part by massive purchases of foreign oil.
   Currently, foreign and domestic car makers are required to
meet a 27.5-mile-a-gallon average for their U.S. fleets,
about twice what the manufacturers averaged in the mid-1970s.
But after years of increases, the average fuel economy of
cars sold in the U.S. began dropping two years ago -- 4%
since 1988, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
   In the 1990 model year, Ford, GM and Chrysler Corp. expect
to average from 26.5 miles a gallon to 27.1 miles a gallon,
although all should avoid paying federal fines because of
credits accumulated in past years. The companies say their
numbers are down because they're selling more cars with
bigger engines and weight-adding options and safety
equipment.
   Even bigger drops in fuel economy have come from Japanese
car makers, who once sold only small cars but are now making
an aggressive bid for the heart of the U.S. market. This past
fall, Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. each introduced
luxury cars with V-8 engines. Partly because of this,
Toyota's corporate average is projected to drop to 30.5 miles
per gallon this model year, about 6% below the 1988 level of
32.6 miles. The imports are "moving aggressively backwards,"
complains Sen. Bryan.
   Now, the Bryan bill would require each manufacturer to
boost its individual fuel economy, first by 20% then by 40%
-- a change from the practice of requiring manufacturers to
meet a single, industrywide number or pay penalties. The
approach in the Bryan bill has incensed the Japanese, who say
it imposes an especially tough burden because their
fuel-economy averages already exceed those of the U.S. Big
Three.
   By contrast, Chrysler and Ford each prefer the
percentage-by-manufacturer approach over an industrywide
number, although they feel the numbers in the Bryan bill are
way too high. GM is opposed to C.A.F.E. standards, period,
company spokesmen say.
   For its part, the Senate clean air bill will add perhaps
$600 to the cost of a new car. But many auto executives
believe a tough fuel economy law will be much worse, perhaps
forcing them to stop building big cars entirely.
   Backers of tougher fuel economy insist the auto makers
could meet the standards without significantly cutting down
the size of cars. Sen. Bryan points to a U.S. Office of
Technology Assessment study that found car makers could
improve fuel economy merely through more extensive use of
existing technology, such as front-wheel drive, fuel
injection and multivalve engines.
   Ronald Boltz, Chrysler's vice president of product
strategy and regulatory affairs, disagrees, saying that
changes in technology will produce some of these gains, but
the rest must come from reduced weight.
   Since 1974, the auto industry has slimmed down the average
U.S. car to a little less than 3,000 pounds from more than
4,000 pounds. In many cases, car makers were able to trim
weight without reducing interior volume, but Mr. Boltz says
that won't be the case this time around. The Bryan bill would
force Chrysler to have an average fuel economy of 39.8 miles
per gallon by 2001, making its largest car a compact, he
says.
   To some senators, that is reminiscent of the mid-1970s,
when Ford warned that the first fuel economy law could
require a product line of "all sub-Pinto sized vehicles."
