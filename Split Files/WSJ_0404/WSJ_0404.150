   Howell Corp. said in Houston that it received a $32
million federal income tax refund, about two-thirds of which
is interest, that will yield it $23 million after taxes. It
said it expects to include about $17 million, or $3.50 a
share, in net income when it reports first-quarter results.
   A year earlier, the energy industry holding company had
net income of $4.5 million, or 94 cents a share, including a
gain of $3.8 million, or 79 cents a share, from an accounting
change. Howell said it plans to use the funds to retire its
senior secured debt.

   The refund is the result of amended returns filed in 1988
for the years 1978 through 1980. Howell said its claims were
related to a dispute between it and the Department of Energy
that was finally settled last year. The accrual of $21
million in interest reflects statutory provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, Howell said.
