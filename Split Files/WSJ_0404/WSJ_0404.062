   TOKYO -- Hiroko Noto joins the crowd in Aunt Stella's
cookie shop, convinced that she's buying American cookies.
Souvenir boxes and cans with drawings of wide-open American
farms line the shelves. The sweet-smelling cookies must be
popular back in the heart of America, the 42-year-old
housewife figures.
   But they're not. In fact, the 56-store cookie chain in
Japan doesn't even exist in the U.S. Established by an
American resident of Japan, the business was created
specifically for the Japanese market.

   "It said `Aunt Stella,' so I assumed it was from America,"
says the disappointed Ms. Noto, frowning at the English
writing on her paper bag. "Is Stella Japanese?"
   Though tension between the U.S. and Japan runs high and
polls show that many Japanese think Americans are lazy and
produce poor-quality products, the American image still holds
great appeal, at least when it comes to food products. U.S.
and Japanese companies are reaping big profits by making such
products as cookies, doughnuts and coffee look more American
-- or rather, the Japanese notion of American.
   The trick is to figure out what looks suitably American to
the Japanese. "Japanese images of America are often quite
different from what we think they are," says Deborah Howard,
managing director of Japan Market Resource Network, which
helps American companies market their products in Japan.
   Images that ring a bell are those of the Colonial era, the
1950s and power-hungry New York businessmen, says Makoto
Takeuchi, a commercial planner at Dentsu Inc., Japan's
biggest advertising agency. Companies fiddle with their
products to fit these images, he says, "whether or not these
things really exist."
   Many of the favored images represent an America that long
ago ceased to exist -- if it ever did exist. Pastures,
plantations and log cabins are particularly popular.
   Other products aren't so different from what America's own
image-makers create: Lemon and grapefruit-flavored juices and
candy often call themselves Californian, and a chocolate
cereal snack is called "Fifth Avenue."
   Joseph Dunkle, who started the Aunt Stella cookie chain
eight years ago, cashed in by tinkering with an old-fashioned
apple-pie image. Aided by funding by the Saison Group, which
in 1974 bought his company and kept him on as president, Mr.
Dunkle packaged cookies in dainty ceramic "Aunt Stella" dolls
and furnished his stores with early American furniture. The
entrepreneur even hired Japanese women to draw Amish designs
on tin cans, hoping to appeal to middle-aged women, the main
purchasers of such products, which often are given as
souvenir gifts when meeting people.
   The cookies themselves are somewhat American, although
smaller and harder, like sweetened traditional Japanese rice
crackers. But the flavors ("American coffee," for instance)
seem to sustain the foreign image. Sales of Aunt Stella
cookies are growing by 38% every year, says Mr. Dunkle, and
are expected to reach 4 billion yen ($25 million) this year.
Lured by the homey image, executive wives buy 20,000-yen
packages (about $125) as presents for their husbands' office
mates, he says.
   But Japanese tastes in American images are difficult to
predict. "It's an evolving type of strategy that almost can't
be planned," says Robert Kuhn, a corporate strategist helping
American companies enter the Japanese market.
   When David's Specialty Food Inc., the New York food
concern, started selling its cookies in Japan a few years
ago, it aimed for a pop American image. But "it was a
mismatch," says Jun Kawara, a marketing and planning manager
of the Tokyo operation. The design didn't appeal to rich but
conservative housewives.
   Japanese companies often have more success at effectively
Americanizing American products. Japan's Mister Donut stores
started looking more "American" when Duskin Co., a
dust-control company based in Osaka, bought the chain's
Japanese operations six years ago from the U.S.'s
International Multifoods Corp. Confident that a 1950s image
would boost doughnut sales, Duskin put pink neon flamingos by
the windows of new outlets and installed revolving
merry-go-rounds. Speakers blare out a specially made tape of
1950s music, interspersed with comments -- in English -- by a
disc jockey.
   "There's a nostalgic feeling among the Japanese people"
for that era, says Shigeharu Komai, president of Duskin. "We
were miserable after the war. And America was our dream."
   Growth in sales for the Mister Donut chain, which now has
about 670 outlets in Japan, surged from about 10% or 15% to
as much as 25%, says a Duskin spokesman, making up a quarter
of Duskin's annual 280 billion yen sales.
   Many customers know the image is made up, but they like
the atmosphere anyway. "This is Duskin's strategy to lure
Japanese young people that like American things," says
19-year-old Mie Matsubara. Not that it bothers her, she adds
hastily.
   Encouraged by Mister Donut's growth, Duskin is now
bringing in other restaurant chains with 1950s atmosphere.
One, Studebaker's, has walls lined with bright neon tubes and
displays a bright red open car in the center.
   Some American companies have come up with successful
Japanese versions of America on their own. Coca-Cola (Japan)
Ltd.'s Georgia Coffee, a ready-to-drink canned coffee created
specifically for the Japanese market 15 years ago, is now the
company's best-selling product after Coke. The drink's brown
label plays off a Colonial image, with a sepia-toned picture
of people in Colonial garb sitting at a table on the lawn of
a plantation, with cups and what looks like a teapot on the
table. (Coca-Cola can't explain the teapot, but it doesn't
seem to have hurt sales.)
   Japanese consumers can identify with Georgia because of
their attachment to the movie "Gone with the Wind," says
Frank Kelly, representative director of Coca-Cola (Japan).
(Sanraku Inc., an alcoholic beverage producer, will start
selling Californian wine with a scene from "Gone with the
Wind" on its label next month.)
   Although Coca-Cola doesn't release its sales, industry
followers estimate that sales jumped nearly 10% to about 170
billion yen, or 2.6 billion cans in 1989. Sales of Coke were
around 3.1 billion cans in the same period.
   To portray America attractively to the Japanese, companies
admit they sometimes do things that seem strange to an
American. Mr. Dunkle, who markets Aunt Stella's cookies, uses
the phrase "warm heart communication" in English on packaging
and in catalogs.
   The phrase may not make sense to an American, but that is
of little concern to the Japan-oriented entrepreneur. "I
don't care," he laughs. "I'm not selling to Americans."
