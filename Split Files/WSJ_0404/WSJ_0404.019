   The Global View column on this page Monday, "Who Will Pay
the Bill for Russia's Decline?" used some inaccurately
transmitted statistics regarding man-days lost in the Soviet
Union. The correct numbers are 9.1 million mandays lost in
the first two months this year, compared with 7.3 million for
the full year 1989.
   (See: "Who Will Pay the Price for Russia's Decline?" --
WSJ April 2, 1990).
