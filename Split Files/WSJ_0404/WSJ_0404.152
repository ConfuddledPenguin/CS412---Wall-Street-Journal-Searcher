   Systems &amp; Computer Technology Corp., Malvern, Pa., said it
expects to report a loss for its second quarter ended last
Saturday.
   The software products company cited delays in the signing
of several contracts for products, which Systems &amp; Computer
had anticipated in the second quarter. The contracts are
expected to be recorded in the third quarter, the company
said. In the year-earlier second quarter, the company earned
$703,000, or six cents a share, on revenue of $10.3 million.
