   WASHINGTON -- The government's leading economic
forecasting gauge fell 1% in February, the Commerce
Department reported, largely because of an aberrant decline
in the number of building permits issued.
   It was an unusual jump in building permits that helped
produce a 0.2% increase in the measure in January. Excluding
permits, one of the 11 statistics that make up the
department's index of leading indicators, the index slipped
0.1% in February and 0.5% in January.

   There was a rush by builders in January to obtain permits
to beat the Jan. 13 cutoff date for a federal requirement for
buildings to provide special access to the handicapped.
Permits applications dropped off precipitously after that
date.
   The department originally said the January index figure
was unchanged from December; it also revised the December
increase to 0.4% from 0.6%.
   The index is designed to foreshadow economic activity six
to nine months in the future. While some analysts study the
numbers diligently, others dismiss them as an unreliable
predictor of the economy's movements.
   Seven of the 11 elements contributed to February's
decline, the department reported. Besides building permits,
they were deliveries to factories by suppliers, stock prices,
plant and equipment orders, material prices, factory backlogs
and consumer expectations.
   Pushing the index up in February were growth in the money
supply, a drop in unemployment claims and growth in new
orders for consumer goods. The average workweek was
unchanged.
   Some analysts said the index is forecasting economic
stagnation, while others suggested it may mean just modest
gains.
   Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp. in
Newark, N.J., said, "The decline in the index shows the
economy is still very, very weak." Modest improvement is the
most that is expected, he said. "The index has been going
down for the better part of the year. So the level is not
showing any improvement."
   But Joel Prakken, vice president of Laurence H. Meyer &amp;
Associates Ltd. in St. Louis, said the economic slowdown has
passed. He said his company looks for economic growth at a 2%
annual rate in the current quarter, up from his estimate of a
0.8% rate in the first period.
   "The economy's growth in 1990 will occur in sectors least
sensitive to interest rates," said William K. MacReynolds,
director of forecasting at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "But
growth will be far below potential because high interest
rates and the economic slowdown are producing a credit
crunch."

   Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, they produced a 1.0% de- crease in the
index for February and a 0.2% increase for January.
