   NEW YORK -- Pressed by the credit-rating agencies and by
regulators including the New York Stock Exchange, big
brokerage firms are getting rid of their junk-bond portfolios
and other illiquid investments.
   In recent days, both General Electric Co.'s Kidder,
Peabody Group Inc. and American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman
Hutton Holdings Inc. have moved to sell large portfolios of
high-yield junk bonds.

   CS First Boston Inc. has taken steps to trim its exposure
to temporary "bridge" loans that it has been stuck with
because of the junk-bond market's paralysis. Other brokerage
firms are expected to take similar steps.
   Because the brokerage industry is highly leveraged, it can
be fatal if a firm finds itself stuck with a large amount of
securities it can't sell quickly. The collapse of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Group Inc., the one-time leader of the
junk-bond market, drove that point home. Drexel suffered a
fatal squeeze when it had huge losses on its illiquid
junk-bond portfolio and lenders pulled away.
   "When you see something like Drexel fail, people tend to
get religious," says Kenneth J. Pinkes, head of
financial-institutions research at Moody's Investors Service
Inc.
   Both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the major
credit-rating agencies, have been sounding warnings about the
condition of brokerage firms' balance sheets, complaining
about large holdings of risky, hard-to-sell investments. And
brokerage firms have been listening because a downgrade by
the credit firms can be devastating. Big securities firms
must routinely borrow hundreds of millions of dollars to
finance their day-to-day operations.
   Brokerage firms "are taking a more conservative approach
to the balance sheet," says Michael Goldstein, brokerage
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   The brokerage industry has never been that heavily
regulated, says Mr. Goldstein. But the purging of junk bonds
and other illiquid investments by big brokerage firms shows
that may be changing, he says.
   "Now we're seeing that basic lack of regulation and
growing credit fear cause a backlash, whereby both
supervisory agencies and {brokerage} firms are trying to rid
themselves of potential problems," Mr. Goldstein says. "And I
expect that basic trend to continue for some time."
   But this new-found caution won't necessarily be good for
investors. It could mean that brokerage firms take fewer
risks for customers' benefit, such as refusing to keep a big
inventory of junk bonds the firms underwrite and sell to
clients.
   And there is another potential problem: Even as Wall
Street pares its holdings of junk bonds and other illiquid
holdings, some firms are busy beefing up their junk-bond
trading and research staffs, meaning their employees are
pushing junk at a time when the firm itself is fleeing from
it.
   While brokerage firms don't want to have much junk in
their portfolios, the firms don't mind making money through
short-term trading opportunities and by selling new junk-bond
issues. (Wall Street makes an average of $5 million in fees
for each new junk-bond issue.)
   For example, Kidder's move to sell its junk bonds, bridge
loans and other merchant banking holdings to its parent, GE,
for $750 million, followed by only weeks an attempt to beef
up Kidder's junk-bond operations.
   Kidder hired Salomon Brothers Inc.'s former head junk-bond
trader, Thomas Bernard; at the time, James Mullin, a Kidder
managing director, said he viewed the junk-bond market as a
"real opportunity." Kidder also quietly hired Michael
Meagher, a respected junk-bond trader specializing in
bankruptcies, from Salomon; Mr. Meagher is slated to start at
Kidder this week.
   The crosscurrents underscore the sticky situation Wall
Street faces concerning junk bonds. Although securities firms
are facing pressure to get junk off their books -- and avoid
any big junk-bond blowups that would hit their bottom line --
they badly want to take advantage of the absence of Drexel,
which virtually created and then dominated the junk market in
the 1980s.
   But Wall Street firms don't want to flame out as Drexel
did. Besides pressure from the credit-rating agencies,
brokerage firms say the New York Stock Exchange has been
asking for more-comprehensive monthly reports on the firms'
balance sheets. And it appears that more firms are being hit
with so-called blockage charges -- a way for the Big Board
and the Securities and Exchange Commission to encourage firms
to rid themselves of illiquid investments. The regulators
provide this encouragement by deducting against a firm's
regulatory capital 100% of the value of particularly risky
investments.
   Besides the blockage charges, the Big Board has also been
hitting brokerage firms with higher regulatory capital
requirements, or "haircuts," to reflect the illiquid junk
inventories. A Big Board spokesman wouldn't comment on such
pressure, except to say: "We're always monitoring our member
firms' capital positions to make sure they're in compliance
with regulations."
   Lawrence Eckenfelder, a brokerage industry analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities, is more blunt. He says that
"unfortunately, you've got a lot of assets {on brokerage-firm
balance sheets} that shouldn't be sitting there. Liquidity is
the name of the game here."
   The image the brokerage firms now want to project to the
marketplace is that they are "clean of what the market
considers are tainted assets," says Mr. Pinkes of Moody's. He
says the brokerage firms' actions are "very natural
developments to clean up balance sheets, to unleverage, to
position themselves as sound credit risks."
   "We are moving away from illiquid investments; we're doing
it for business reasons," says a spokesman for Shearson,
which Monday said it plans to sell $480 million of junk
bonds. When Kidder purged itself of junk, it said it was
removing all its "high-yield, illiquid inventory" and that
the Big Board was "enormously pleased" by that.
   Some analysts say they are worried about increased selling
pressure on the already battered junk-bond market as the big
brokerage firms trim their portfolios. S&amp;P says that
shouldn't be a problem.
   Says Jeffrey Bowman, an S&amp;P vice president: "S&amp;P believes
management will be able to reduce their exposures on an
orderly basis. What is really illiquid and probably doesn't
have much value is the bridges," which are temporary loans
brokerage firms make to finance their clients' takeover
deals. "One positive development from all this is that
brokerage firms are working toward reducing their bridge
exposure," he says.
   Although First Boston recently said it held just $107
million in its junk-bond portfolio, it was forced by
credit-rating agencies to sell to its parent more than half
of its troubled $450 million bridge loan to Ohio Mattress Co.
