   NEW YORK -- Defunct junk-bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. will sell some of its crown jewels and put its
client list on the auction block April 18.
   As part of its efforts to raise funds to satisfy
creditors, Drexel is offering for sale computer databases
containing names of its contacts at more than 4,000 firms;
technical and pricing information on all the firm's public
securities offerings and mergers and acquisition deals in the
past several years; and its system for trading, selling and
researching high-risk, high-yield bonds.

   Steven Anreder, a spokesman for the company, said the firm
had received calls from "virtually every major firm on the
Street, and others" interested in buying the information.
   "Everybody wants to step up to the plate and take over
Drexel's place in this market," says Mike Ross, a junk-bond
analyst at Blunt, Ellis &amp; Loewi. "Now you've got a chance to
get your hands on some of their proprietary info."
Particularly valuable, he said, will be Drexel's guide to
pricing junk bonds, a task that has proven difficult amid the
recent upheaval in the junk-bond market.
   Much of the interest has come from former Drexel
employees, now at other firms, who find their new employers'
analytical software inferior to Drexel's, says a spokeswoman
for Drexel's corporate finance department. Drexel has
information on "little-known, thinly traded junk-bond
offerings" and has developed software to compare merger and
acquisition deals in different industries for pricing
purposes, she says.
   But perhaps the most desired item is the "contacts
database," she said. "People feel very strongly about getting
their hands on" the list of "financial decisionmakers at each
company, and what level of interest they have" in buying
bonds or doing deals, according to the spokeswoman.
   Drexel has already successfully, and privately, sold most
of its fixed-income bond databases, and now is anxious to
sell those for mergers and acquisitions and junk bonds. "The
longer we wait to sell things, the less value they'll have,"
the spokeswoman said.
   The databases are up for bid both separately and together.
Strong interest has come from "boutiques, some of the LBO
{leveraged buy-out} firms, merger-and-acquisition advisers
and niche players," according to the spokeswoman.
   Drexel declined to provide a price estimate price for the
information. But the auction for the databases, in Wall
Street fashion, will be run like a Dutch auction. If Drexel
sells its data bases to more than one buyer, the sale price
for all buyers will be set based on an average of the high
and low bids. Any firm that wants the Drexel information on
an exclusive basis will have to bid more than all the other
bidders combined.
