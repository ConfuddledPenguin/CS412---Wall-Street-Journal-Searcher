   Your March 5 page-one article on the success of the Range
Rover omitted a key reason for its success.
   Yes, the car itself is a work of rugged luxury. But the
advertising that positioned it in the public's mind was
crucial. It made Range Rover -- the most
unpretentious-looking of all the station wagons -- the style
of choice among the rich who can afford any car, regardless
of price. In effect, the advertising created a "Range Rover
culture," causing a vehicle originally designed for roadless
Africa to transcend its category and become chic.

   It is also interesting that the ad agency that created the
campaign is Grace &amp; Rothschild Inc., the same Roy Grace and
Diane Rothschild who, when both were at Doyle Dane, did the
breakthrough ads that helped make the Volkswagen beetle the
No. 1 car import for many years.
