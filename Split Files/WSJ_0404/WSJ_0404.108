   WASHINGTON -- The urge to merge might be waning on Wall
Street, but it's growing on this city's K Street.
   K Street is the thriving, main thoroughfare of
Washington's principal non-government industry,
influence-peddling. And like the corporate world of the
mid-to-late 1980s, the lobbying business is going through a
transformation: Big lobbying conglomerates are gobbling up
smaller firms with increasing frequency, and controversy.

   By far the largest Washington acquirer of late is a
deceptively quiet foreigner, WPP Group PLC, the British
advertising and public-relations giant. Without fanfare, it
has purchased all or part of lobbying-related firms headed by
some of the best-known names in the Washington establishment,
including lobbyists William Timmons and Charls E. Walker and
public-relations executives Jody Powell and Robert Gray.
   Other communications companies have been active, too.
Young &amp; Rubicam Inc.'s Burson-Marsteller subsidiary recently
purchased the lobbying firm of Gold &amp; Liebengood. And Earle
Palmer Brown, the Washington area's largest advertising
agency, bought the Madison Public Affairs Group, a lobbying
and public-relations firm. Other mergers are in the wind.
   "The people I know in lobbying have all gotten inquiries
about purchase by big firms," says Margery Kraus, president
of Apco Associates, the lobbying arm of the law firm Arnold &amp;
Porter. "We've had people come to us, but we already have a
parent."
   The public will be the loser in this merger mania, critics
charge. They contend that the creation of mega-lobbying firms
works against the public interest by concentrating too much
power in the hands of the big-money interests who can afford
to hire these firms. "Ultimately, it's the public who gets
squeezed every time," asserts Ellen Miller, executive
director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan
think tank.
   Widespread consolidation also produces the likelihood that
conflicts of interest will arise between rival corporate
interests within the firms. "There is precisely the same
potential for conflict that there has been in the 1980s in
the investment community," says Pat Choate, a TRW Inc. vice
president and author of a forthcoming book on foreign
lobbying. "It's the client's responsibility to be vigilant."
   The question of conflict is apparent with even a cursory
glance at WPP Group's Washington clients: Robert Gray's Hill
&amp; Knowlton Public Affairs Worldwide Co. works for Mazda
Corp., while its sister company, Timmons &amp; Co., represents
Chrysler Corp. Jody Powell's Ogilvy &amp; Mather Public Affairs
Inc. occasionally represents whiskey-maker Joseph E. Seagram
&amp; Sons Inc., while its 30%-owned affiliate, Charls E. Walker
Associates Inc., works for beer-maker Anheuser-Busch Cos.
   Not surprisingly, the lobbying firms don't see a conflict.
They contend that each WPP unit operates "independently,"
giving any corporation leave to hire a WPP division and not
worry if a competitor hires a separate one. By maintaining
such distinctions, WPP believes it can attract many more
clients and also add "marketing panache," says Robert
Dilenschneider, chief executive officer of Hill &amp; Knowlton
Inc., New York. "The separation gives WPP a chance to show
more than one face to the potential customer," he says.
   The bulk of lobbying in Washington continues to be done by
law firms. But they hold no monopoly. The business of
influencing government has become an increasingly
sophisticated, multidisciplinary exercise, and, to compete
for big corporate clients, firms are moving toward placing
more and more of those skills under one roof. That has
spawned merger mania.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton Public Affairs in Washington is the model
for diversified lobbying of this kind. In its 180-person
office overlooking the Potomac River, it wields almost every
tool in the modern lobbyists' arsenal. It has traditional
lobbyists who contact lawmakers and executive-branch
officials. But it also has researchers, economists, political
analysts, publicists, graphic artists, speech writers and
managers of campaign contributions. It trains executives how
to give news interviews and advises them when to avoid them.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton also houses an entire electronic broadcast
studio. It produces radio and television spots of varying
lengths, ranging from brief video news releases to
documentaries extolling a client country's economy. It
broadcasts its own "news" programs too, including a monthly
"magazine radio" show called Washington Spotlight, and a
shorter radio program, called Capitolink, which it sends via
satellite to 4,400 radio stations five days a week and which,
it says, is regularly used by about 1,000 of them. Hill &amp;
Knowlton is careful to include in each broadcast the fact
that its segments are sponsored by clients.
   The concept behind all this is the widespread belief that
Washington lobbyists can no longer get things done by
themselves. They can no longer rely on friendships or
rational debate; they also have to persuade politicians that
the voters are with them.
   "We've moved a long way toward plebiscite democracy,"
Charls Walker says. "In many {lobbying} efforts, you have to
get out toward the constituency, and that requires skills we
don't have here in Walker Associates." Those skills are
housed at its affiliate, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, he says, and that's
where he refers his clients.
   One client that Mr. Walker referred was Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC, which last year fended off a takeover attempt by
Minorco S.A. Walker Associates lobbied for Consolidated, and
Ogilvy did its public relations. Such cooperation between
sister companies isn't unusual. Robinson, Lake, Lerer &amp;
Montgomery lobbies for the National Venture Capital
Association; its parent, Bozell Inc., produces its print
advertising that advocates a capital-gains tax cut.
   Surely there always will be small, specialized lobbying
firms, referred to as boutiques, as well as the Hill &amp;
Knowlton-style lobbying supermarkets. But, says Thomas Bell
Jr., vice chairman of public relations firm
Burson-Marsteller, "the growth will be in the firms that can
do it all."
   Indeed, corporate lobbying in general, which has grown
drastically over the past decade, is likely to continue to
grow for a long time to come. "I don't see any way to stop
Washington growth," Robert Gray says. "I've never seen it
decline."
   "WPP is looking all the time," Mr. Dilenschneider says. "A
month does not go by when a {merger} conversation is not held
in Washington."
