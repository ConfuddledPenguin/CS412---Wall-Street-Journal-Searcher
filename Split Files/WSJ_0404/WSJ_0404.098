   WASHINGTON -- The toughest political trade-offs over clean
air may not occur on the House or Senate floor but in a
conference committee, when leaders from both chambers meet to
settle their differences.
   According to some predictions, the contentious
deliberations could take months, leaving the issue unresolved
until the politically charged days before the November
elections. Already it's possible to detect some of the
important differences between the two houses:

   CARS: There's disagreement over how fast to require an
initial round of cuts in tailpipe emissions and how to decide
whether to require a second round. The first round, estimated
to add $100 to the price of a car, would take effect earlier
under the Senate bill than under the leading House proposal.
There also are different triggers for determining when a
second round, estimated to add $500 to the price, kicks in.
                                                                                                       

   FUELS: Even though both houses are tilting toward
reformulated gasoline, there are likely to be differences
over how clean the fuel must be and over how widely to
require its use.
                                                                                                       

   SMOG: The chief difference now appears to be over how
strong a federal role to require in forcing states and cities
to clean up their air -- a major issue for environmentalists
and state and local groups. The leading House proposal would
require the federal government to impose clean-up plans on
areas that fail to come up with them on their own; the Senate
bill would leave full responsibility with the states.
Smoggier cities also would be required to take harsher steps
than cleaner ones under the House plan, including applying
controls to smaller polluters.
                                                                                                       

   TOXIC EMISSIONS: To date, the Senate and House are
pursuing different techniques for eliminating remaining
cancer risks from factories after they've installed the best
available anti-pollution technology. Environmentalists think
the Senate approach sets too weak a health standard.
Yesterday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted to
adopt an approach for the remaining risks that is similar to
existing law, requiring the EPA to establish health-based
standards that provide an "ample margin of safety" to the
maximum exposed individual.
                                                                                                       

   UTILITIES: Power plants would have to make required
reductions in sulfur dioxide sooner under the Senate plan.
The Senate gives extra tradable credits to the dirtiest
Midwest utilities that bear the heaviest costs and to
utilities across the country that need to be able to expand
to meet rising electricity demands. The plan also gives
double the usual credits to utilities that install scrubbers,
rather than switching to low-sulfur coal.
   The House committee may consider similar changes when it
takes up the subject of acid rain this week.
