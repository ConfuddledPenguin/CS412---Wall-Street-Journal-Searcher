   FULLERTON, Calif. -- Federal health authorities said they
decertified a pap-smear laboratory here because the lab,
whose largest client until a year ago was Planned Parenthood,
was misdiagnosing many pap-smear samples.
   Pap smears are used to detect cervical cancer.

   The closely held lab, National Cancer Screening
Laboratories, is now closed, says president Neil Gregory, and
has been winding down its business for 10 months because it
was operating unprofitably and had trouble finding workers.
Mr. Gregory says his lab has been certified by state and
federal agencies for 20 years without any problem, and that
the margin of error in his lab is no greater than at any
other pap-smear lab.
   But Harry Barba, associate regional administrator in San
Francisco for the Health Care Financing Administration, a
Health and Human Services agency that certifies labs to
receive Medicaid and Medicare funds, said inaccuracies at the
lab were unacceptable. Of 331 tests reviewed by the agency,
64 were inaccurate or misleading, he said. Mr. Barba said the
lab at one time performed 100,000 pap smears a year, although
Mr. Gregory said the number fell to 7,200 last year and that
most were not paid for with federal funds.
   While blocking federal funding for labs remains rare, Mr.
Barba said his agency last year decertified Central Pathology
Services Medical Group Inc. in Tarzana, Calif., which he said
performed 700,000 pap smears annually.
