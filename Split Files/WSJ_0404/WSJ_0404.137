   Shareholders of DPL Inc., a utility holding company based
in Dayton, Ohio, approved doubling the number of authorized
common shares to 120 million, paving the way for a 3-for-2
stock split, payable May 4 to stock of record next Wednesday.
   The company has about 45 million shares outstanding.

   Authority to issue additional shares will provide the
company with flexibility in financing the completion of the
Zimmer generating station. The plant, which was initially
built for nuclear power but is being converted to coal, is
scheduled to begin operation in 1991, the company said.
   Separately, holders of DPL preferred shares voted to
reduce the par value of common stock to one cent a share from
$7 a share. The action increases the funds legally available
for payment of dividends, DPL said.
