   Advest Group Inc., hurt by the slump in the securities
industry, said it expects to post a loss of $5 million, or 50
cents a share, for its second quarter ended last Saturday.
   The regional brokerage firm, based in Hartford, Conn., had
year-earlier profit of $2 million, or 20 cents a share, on
revenue of $54.6 million.

   Advest said the results for the latest period include a $5
million pretax charge for a contingency reserve for assets
held by Advest Credit Corp., which is in liquidation, and for
possible losses on other investments and loans in oil and gas
partnerships and in real estate partnerships acquired by
Advest Group in the past five years. Advest said its
quarterly dividend of four cents a share won't be affected.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Advest shares closed at $5.375, unchanged.
