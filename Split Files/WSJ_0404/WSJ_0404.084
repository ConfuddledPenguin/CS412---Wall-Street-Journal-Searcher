   ANGELES CORP. set its initial cash distribution on its 1.7
million newly issued units at 30.56 cents per unit, and said
the amount would be paid April 30 to unitholders of record
April 16. Issuance of the units was part of the company's
recent acquisition of the assets of several affiliated
entities for $36.6 million. Each unit consists of one-half
share of common stock, one-fiftieth of a new 12 1/2%
subordinated debenture due 2005, and a special cash payment
of $1 over the four-year life of the unit. Angeles, a Los
Angeles investment management concern, said that the initial
cash payment covers the period between March 3 and April 15.
