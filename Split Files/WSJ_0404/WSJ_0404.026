   WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court panel gave the
regional Bell companies strong encouragement and a second
crack at persuading U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene
to let them enter the lucrative information services
business.
   At the same time, the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld Judge
Greene's decisions to maintain restrictions on the Bells'
entry into long-distance and telecommunications equipment
manufacturing.

   Judge Greene, who oversees the 1982 consent decree that
broke up the Bell System, ruled in 1987 that the Bell
companies could transmit computer-based information services,
such as electronic yellow pages, but couldn't generate or own
the content.
   The appeals court panel said in an unsigned opinion that
because the parties to the decree -- the seven regional
Bells, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and the Justice
Department -- didn't oppose lifting the information services
restriction, the lower court applied the wrong legal
standard. The lower court erred in requiring a Bell company
to show "no substantial possibility that it could use its
monopoly power to impede competition" in a market it wants to
enter, the judges said.
   They sent the matter back to the lower court, with
instructions to decide whether removing the restriction
"would be anti-competitive under present market conditions."
The appeals court also said the lower court must keep in mind
whether Bell entry is "within the reaches of the public
interest."
   "The court made it very clear that the relevant standard
is one that is very favorable to entry into information
services," said Laurence Tribe, a prominent constitutional
specialist at Harvard Law School, who represented the Bell
companies.
   "We read this as a strong signal to the district court
that there is no basis for keeping this ban in place," Mr.
Tribe said. The lower court was instructed that it "should
not ask whether Bell entry into information services would
best serve society" but whether it meets the flexible public
interest test, he said.
   In a footnote, the appeals court said it was troubled with
the "practical difficulty of enforcing" the lower court's
partial relaxation of the information services ban. It told
the court on remand to "consider whether the residual
anti-competitive risks associated with lifting the
restriction" on the Bells' generating the content of
information services outweighs the court's extra
administrative work to police the partial ban.
   The Bell companies generally were pleased with the
decision, but expressed some dismay that the manufacturing
and long-distance bans weren't overturned. Chicago-based
Ameritech, for example, called the decision "a welcome step
forward," but said it is "disappointed all restrictions on
Ameritech's business activities have not been removed." New
York-based Nynex Corp. said it was "greatly encouraged."
   Ronald Stowe, head of Pacific Telesis Group's Washington
office, said that the decision didn't go "as far as we
thought it would go," but that the company is encouraged,
anyway. San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis has been
considering several types of information services, should it
win permission, including electronic yellow pages and
services that could be tailored to each customer's needs. For
example, he said, a customer could request a call every
morning at 8 o'clock with sports scores for specific teams,
prices on several stocks, the weather report and a synopsis
of major news stories in the morning papers. "We can't do it
now, without running into the brick wall of the {consent
decree} restrictions," Mr. Stowe said.
   The American Newspaper Publishers Association, a
vociferous opponent of any Bell entry into information
services, said the decision "does not undermine the policy
basis for the current restriction" on electronic publishing.
"We continue to believe that a prohibition on {Bell} entry
into electronic publishing over their own lines is good
public policy. It is the best assurance of the development of
a maximum number of diverse electronic information services
for the American consumer." The publishers have voiced
concern that future electronic yellow-pages offerings and
other shopping services offered by the Bells could eat away
at newspapers' advertising revenues.
   James Casserly, who represents Independent Data
Communications Manufacturers Association Inc., counted "a
number of ticking time bombs for people who are happy with
the immediate result of {yesterday's} decision." The appeals
court, he said, might be "making it easier for the Bells to
come back and ask for further relief." He cited, for example,
the appeals courts' instruction that the lower court
shouldn't be concerned about effects on local customers.
   The huge case combined appeals stemming from the 1987
triennial review of the consent decree, and one of the many
parties is likely seek a rehearing before the full appeals
court.
   Meanwhile, the Bells are trying to persuade Congress to
lift the restrictions and separately allow the telephone
companies to enter the cable television business. Congress,
however, isn't expected to act on those matters this year,
and the appeals court decision might slow the legislative
process further, particularly if Judge Greene grants the
Bells freedom to provide information services.
   Just how fast the companies could introduce computerized
voice and data services is uncertain. The information
services market, particularly for residential customers, is
in its infancy, and few companies have made strong inroads.
The Bells, which two years ago won the right to offer
electronic gateways that use computer terminals to link
consumers with a variety of information services, have had
little success in penetrating the residential market.
