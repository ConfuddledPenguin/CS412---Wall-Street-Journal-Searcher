   ATLANTA -- In light of its proposed recapitalization plan,
Georgia Gulf Corp. said its board will omit its quarterly
dividend of 25 cents a share.
   Under the recapitalization, which shareholders are
scheduled to vote on April 19, holders would receive for each
share held $30 in cash, $8.50 principal amount of notes and
one share of a new issue of common. The plan was hatched as
an attempt to fend off Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons who,
through Houston-based NL Industries Inc., began seeking
control of Georgia Gulf last August.

   On Monday, Mr. Simmons let his $45-a-share, or $1 billion,
tender offer for Georgia Gulf expire, saying he would support
the company's recapitalization plan.
   Georgia Gulf, a chemical company, also said it completed
the sale of its Freeman Chemical Corp. subsidiary for about
$65 million to Cook Composites &amp; Polymers Co., a closely held
company based in North Kansas City, Mo. Georgia Gulf plans to
use proceeds to help pay for the recapitalization.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Georgia Gulf closed at $44, down 50 cents.
