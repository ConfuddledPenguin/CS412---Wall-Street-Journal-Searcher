   ZEELAND, Mich. -- Herman Miller Inc. said it agreed to
acquire Meridian Inc. of Spring Lake, Mich., in a stock swap
valued at about $28.6 million.
   Herman Miller said it will acquire the closely held maker
of metal-case goods by exchanging 1,380,000 of its common
shares for all of Meridian's shares outstanding. The shares
to be issued will represent 5.4% of Herman Miller's common
stock after the acquisition, Herman Miller said.

   James H. Bloem, Herman Miller vice president and chief
financial officer, said the transaction will neither enhance
nor dilute the company's per-share earnings for the fiscal
year ending June 2. The Michigan office-furniture maker said
it expects to complete the transaction before May 23.
Completion is subject to regulatory approval.
