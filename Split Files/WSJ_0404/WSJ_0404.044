   Landmark Graphics Corp., Houston, said revenue for the
third quarter ended March 31 was about 20% below analysts'
estimates. The company said it expects to report revenue of
$12.5 million, compared with $12 million a year earlier.
   Gene Ennis, Landmark's president and chief executive
officer, cited changing buying patterns of the company's
large domestic customers. He said customers are moving away
from purchasing a single computer-aided exploration system to
contracts covering a large number of systems. "The sales
cycles on these contracts are longer," he said.

   A company spokesman declined to estimate the revenue
shortage's impact on earnings. In the first six months, net
income was $3.1 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenue of
$25.4 million.
