   Piper Jaffray Inc., citing swelling expenses and a
downturn in some operations, said earnings fell 19% in its
second quarter ended March 30, despite a 4.9% increase in
revenue.
   The Minneapolis parent company of the investment firm of
Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. said it earned $2.1 million, or
52 cents a share, compared to the year-earlier $2.6 million,
or 65 cents a share. Revenue rose to $49.5 million, from
$47.2 million.

   Second-quarter earnings "were less than we had expected,"
said Charles N. Hayssen, chief financial officer. "We simply
let certain expenses get slightly ahead of revenues." He said
the company intends "to correct that in the next six months."
   The investment firm said commission revenue climbed about
40% from last year, and trading profits are up about 15%.
Asset management fees also are up about 40%, reflecting the
growth of the company's Piper Capital Management unit. The
company's investment banking business is down about 20%,
"which is true industrywide," Mr. Hayssen said.
