   Dresdner Bank Group of West Germany said it acquired a
7.5% stake in Grand Cathay Securities Corp. of Taipei, an
integrated securities house that is the investment arm of the
ruling Kuomintang Party. This marks the first time a European
bank has penetrated Taiwan's securities business.
   A Dresdner official cited the liberalization of Taiwan's
financial market in choosing to make the investment. Grand
Cathay was established in December 1988, capitalized at 1.5
billion New Taiwan dollars (US$57.3 million). Dresdner Bank
set up a representative office in Taiwan in 1985.

Securities Investment Consulting Co. in Taipei to provide
local investors with Deutscher InvestmentTrust mutual funds
and Thornton Group funds in Asia and Europe. It will be a
joint venture by Dresdner Bank Group and one of its members,
the Thornton Group.
