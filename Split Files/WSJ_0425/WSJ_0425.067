   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said first-quarter profit
plunged 59% because of an "unsatisfactory" performance by its
core retail business and hefty claims at its Allstate
insurance unit.
   The retailing and financial services giant said net income
fell to $106.3 million, or 31 cents a share, from $257.7
million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
3.7% to $12.61 billion from $12.16 billion.

   The results, worse than Wall Street expected, sent Sears
stock down $1.125 to close at a new 52-week low of $35.375 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock
had been sliding in recent weeks as Sears indicated to
analysts that their estimates were too high.
   Edward A. Brennan, the company's chairman and chief
executive officer, said results for the slow first quarter
aren't an "accurate barometer of the year's performance" for
retailers. But he took the unusual step of branding the U.S.
merchandising unit's performance "unsatisfactory." Its loss
widened to $134.2 million from $42.7 million a year ago.
   Sears had anticipated a wider loss because year-earlier
results were helped by publicity surrounding its launch of
its "everyday low pricing" strategy, Mr. Brennan said. But he
blamed "pressure on gross {profit} margins as well as higher
selling costs" for the worse-than-expected showing. Profit
margins were squeezed, analysts said, because Sears's
year-round prices are now lower and the retailer still needs
to offer discounts to stay competitive. Sales of apparel --
an especially profitable business -- also fell in the period,
the analysts said.
   Mr. Brennan said Sears has "made adjustments in the
implementation of our merchandising strategy and we should
experience significantly improved results during the balance
of the year." A spokesman explained that the company is
focusing on managing its payroll more efficiently after
"experiencing unsatisfactory payroll management" in the first
quarter.
   But Edward Weller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in
San Francisco, said he now expects earnings by Sears this
year to be flat with last year's $1.51 billion. He had been
forecasting a slight increase in earnings.
   Sears is in the middle of a massive drive to broaden its
appeal to shoppers and improve its financial results, partly
by cutting costs. The retailer is adding name brands to its
mostly private-label lineup. It also has trimmed and
reorganized its bloated bureaucracy to create business units
that are now held responsible for buying and selling entire
categories of goods.
   The Sears merchandise group, which includes U.S. stores
and catalogs as well as international and Sears credit card
operations, posted a loss of $37.4 million compared with net
income a year ago of $33.8 million. Revenue rose 1.3% to
$6.84 billion from $6.76 billion.
   The company's other units turned in mixed performances:
   -- The Allstate insurance group, hurt by additional claims
stemming from the fourth quarter's severe cold snap and the
San Francisco earthquake, reported a 21% drop in profit to
$193.2 million from $243.9 million. Earnings in the latest
quarter include a gain of $10.5 million from the company's
discontinued group life and health operation.
   -- Profit from Dean Witter Financial Services rose 62% to
$60.7 million from $37.4 million, but most of the improvement
came from the Discover credit card operation. The Discover
card's earnings jumped 76% to $35.4 million from $20.1
million a year ago. Profit from the unit's core securities
business rose a more modest 18% to $24.7 million from $21
million.
   -- The Coldwell Banker Real Estate unit's loss widened to
$33.5 million from $16.2 million a year ago, when the company
had a gain on the sale of property.
