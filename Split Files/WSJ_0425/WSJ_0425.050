   The same congressional leaders who in the name of open
government demand more and more access to executive-branch
documents -- even including Ronald Reagan's personal diaries
-- are the protectors of a secret list that prevents the
American people from knowing where their representatives
really stand. A lone Member has now decided to risk the anger
of the House leadership by ripping away the veil of secrecy.
   In the 1950s and 1960s, autocratic House committee
chairmen routinely bottled up civil-rights bills and refused
to let them come to a floor vote. Today, popular bills
ranging from amendments to balance the budget and ban flag
desecration are routinely buried in committee because the
liberal House leadership opposes them and wants to avoid
votes that could be used against incumbents.

   There is only one real way a majority of Members can bring
legislation to the House floor if it is blocked in committee:
They must produce a discharge petition. If 218 Members -- a
House majority -- sign a discharge petition, the relevant
committee must either vote out the bill or agree to a floor
vote. However, only 19 of 347 discharge petitions have
succeeded.
   This is because the list of Members who have signed a
petition is kept secret -- until the required 218 sign. Only
Members can view the list, and then only briefly to make
certain their name is on it.
   They must first go to the Clerk's desk in the House
chamber. They are handed a statement signed by the Clerk and
Speaker informing them that disclosing the names of signers,
or the number of names, is "strictly prohibited under the
precedents of the House." The sole precedent is an arbitrary
1931 prohibition by Speaker John Nance Garner that was never
made part of official House rules.
   This restriction has made it easy for Speakers to squash
discharge petitions. Whenever the list comes close to 218
names, the Speaker routinely pressures Members to drop off.
The list's secrecy allows them to conceal their timidity from
the voters.
   Rep. Chuck Douglas, a former New Hampshire Supreme Court
Justice, says the petition's secrecy is in direct conflict
with honest and open government. "This covert list allows
Members the best of two political worlds," he told us. "They
can publicly support a measure, like protecting the flag,
while quietly withholding their names from the petition that
would accomplish that."
   He notes that during last year's popular effort to repeal
Section 89 of the tax code, 309 of the 435 House Members
signed on to a repeal bill, but less than half that number
signed the discharge petition, largely to avoid angering
House leaders.
   Mr. Douglas has decided to break up this cozy protection
for hypocrites. He has just filed a discharge petition to
force a vote on his amendment to ban flag desecration. While
he is obliged to not reveal the names of signers, he has
announced he will disclose the names of any Members who claim
to have signed the petition but do not actually do so.
   He plans to do the same with a second discharge petition
to force a vote on a balanced-budget amendment. It has 246
co-sponsors, but Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks
refuses to release it. Rep. Douglas expects a lot of pressure
from his colleagues to back down, but he has no intention of
budging.
   The secret discharge petition is only the latest example
of how House Rules -- or in this case merely a precedent --
are used to shield Members from accountability. We tried to
request documents on the history of the discharge petition's
secrecy by using the Freedom of Information Act, but were
informed that Congress has exempted itself from that law as
well.
