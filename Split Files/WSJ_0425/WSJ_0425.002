   NEW YORK -- Two of Wall Street's biggest securities firms
reported stronger results for the first quarter, largely
reflecting big bond-trading windfalls.
   But Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. didn't
totally escape the securities industry's recent Achilles
heel: a soft investment banking climate.

   Salomon, fueled by a big gain in its Salomon Brothers Inc.
securities unit, reported net income of $119 million, or 88
cents a share, rebounding from a loss of $28 million, or 35
cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Earnings were
helped by a big gain in revenue from trading for the firm's
own account, offset by flat investment banking revenue and a
loss in its commodities unit.
   At Morgan Stanley, net income edged higher, to $82.1
million, or $2.07 a share, from $81.1 million, or $2.02 a
share, a year earlier. A 41% jump in trading revenue more
than made up for a 29% slump in investment banking.
   The two earnings reports cap a tumultuous period for
securities-industry profits. Although some firms managed
modest gains, many didn't, and an industry-record quarterly
loss was posted by American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman
Hutton Holdings Inc. unit. The firms that fared best in the
quarter generally benefited from savvy trading that made up
for a slump in traditional securities businesses. Many
securities firms reported declines of 20% or more in
investment-banking revenue.
   Salomon's trading gains were expected. Morgan Stanley is
known chiefly for its investment banking business. But "in
this quarter, as happened in the crash quarter of 1987,
Morgan has proven that trading can be important as well,"
says Alison Deans, a securities-industry analyst at Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. "It drives home how well they manage overall
business to maintain profitability."
   Separately, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. reported an 18% increase in income from its securities
operations for the quarter; profit dropped 19% at Piper
Jaffray Inc. and 65% at Jefferies Group Inc.
   Both Salomon and Morgan Stanley benefited from their
strong presence overseas. Each got a boost from international
trading profits, analysts said.
   Salomon's securities unit earned $218 million before taxes
for the quarter, compared with a pretax loss of $106 million
a year earlier. But its Phibro Energy segment, a big driver
in Salomon's earnings last year, reported
"uncharacteristically weak earnings" of $4 million in the
quarter, down 96% from the year-earlier $94 million, Salomon
said. Salomon cited weak demand for oil products and losses
in refining and refined-product trading.
   Salomon's Philipp Brothers commodities unit had a pretax
loss of $21 million in the period, narrower than the
year-earlier pretax loss of $60 million. About $11 million of
the most recent loss stemmed from nonferrous-metals trading,
Salomon said, although it declined to identify the specific
metals.
   "I don't think anyone should be proud of" the commodities
unit earnings, said Robert Salomon Jr., a managing director.
"But there is some hope that things will improve."
   Salomon said total revenue for the quarter jumped 53%, to
$2.35 billion, from $1.54 billion.
   At Morgan Stanley, revenue rose 13% to $1.4 billion from
$1.24 billion in the year-earlier period. Besides strong
trading results, the firm was helped by a 7% rise in
commission revenue and a 20% jump in asset-management
proceeds.
   In a statement, Morgan Stanley said its quarterly
performance "benefited from results of improved sales and
trading activities, particularly in fixed income and foreign
exchange. Investment banking revenues declined as a result of
significanly reduced merger and acquisition advice fees,
reflecting a world-wide slowdown" in takeover activity.
   Look for tougher earnings comparisons in the coming two
quarters for many securities firms, some analysts say. That's
partly because it will be more difficult to match
year-earlier results bolstered by increased stock-market
activity in the comparable 1989 periods.
   "Earnings momentum will be very, very weak for the next
few quarters," says Dean Eberling, a financial services
analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton. As for the stocks of many
securities firms, Mr. Eberling says: "Effectively they're
dead money near term."
