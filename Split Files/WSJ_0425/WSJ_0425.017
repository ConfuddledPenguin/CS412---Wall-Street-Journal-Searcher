   SEOUL, South Korea -- Despite sluggish exports, South
Korea's gross national product grew an estimated 7.1% in the
first quarter, compared with 6.2% a year earlier, the Bank of
Korea, the central bank, said.
   The recovery in growth was attributed mainly to brisk
investment in production facilities. The central bank
predicted 7% growth in the GNP, the value of the nation's
output of goods and services, for all of 1990, on the
strength of expected brisk investment in production
facilities and active production activities in the
manufacturing sector.

   The bank also said the country's current account showed a
deficit of US$1.1 billion for the first quarter, compared
with a year-earlier surplus of US$1.3 billion. But it said
the current account is expected to post a surplus of US$1.2
billion for 1990, though this would be significantly narrowed
from a 1989 surplus of US$5.1 billion.
