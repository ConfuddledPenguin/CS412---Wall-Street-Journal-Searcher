   NEW YORK -- The dollar ended nearly 1 1/2 yen higher but
fell slightly against the Deutsche mark against a background
of heavy sales of yen for marks.
   A sense that the market overdid the Japanese currency's
recent runup against the German mark added impetus to yen
sales and highlighted the weakness of the yen in the absence
of fundamental changes in Japanese monetary policy, traders
said.

   The yen was further weakened by news that Moody's Investor
Service Inc. may downgrade credit ratings of two large
Japanese banks, Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Ltd.,
participants said.
   The U.S. currency remained trapped in a tight band against
its West German counterpart on disappointment that the dollar
once again failed to break 1.70 marks after a strong report
on U.S. durable goods orders for March, said Michael Guarino,
vice president and chief dealer at Algemene Bank N.V. in New
York.
   March durable goods orders were up 6.7%, a much sharper
gain than the generally expected 2.3% increase.
   The rise was largely attributed to a 21% surge in
transportation sector orders, and this diluted the
announcement's impact, said Kevin Weir, a vice president of
corporate foreign exchange at Lloyd's Bank in New York.
Excluding transportation, March orders were up 2.0%.
   In addition, reports of poor March sales by major U.S.
auto makers contributed to the perception of a mixed economic
performance last month, Mr. Weir said, putting a damper on
dollar interest.
   Meanwhile, the mark also was helped by purchases of the
German currency for yen, Mr. Guarino said. The mark ended the
New York day at 93.598 yen, up from 92.96 yen at the close of
Tokyo trading and 92.70 yen in New York late Monday.
   One potential source of dollar strength against the mark
was negated by President Bush's decision not to slap the
Soviet Union with sanctions for its economic embargo of
Lithuania, several traders said.
   The market had been anticipating a move to the U.S. unit
as a safe-haven currency in the event of sanctions, said Mark
Morris, a corporate foreign-exchange dealer at National
Westminster Bank in New York.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6980 marks, down from 1.6995 marks late Monday, and at
158.93 yen, sharply higher than 157.60 yen late Monday.
Sterling was quoted $1.6343, slightly below $1.6356 Monday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 158.92 yen, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 158.15 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6940 marks.
   "People are happy with their 50 or 60 point (trading)
bands" and are unwilling to stake large positions either way,
said George de Luna, a vice president at Creditanstalt
Bankverein in New York.
   In the case of the yen, participants said the market is
still waiting for the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of
Finance to construct a cohesive plan to support the currency.
The centerpiece of that plan would have to be a rise in the
Japanese discount rate from the current 5.25%.
   But the market isn't banking on that happening soon, said
Algemene's Mr. Guarino, who called statements earlier
yesterday by Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno expressing
confidence in the Group of Seven's intervention policy as
"more jaw-boning."
   Similarly, more news about the effects of monetary union
between the Germanys is needed before the dollar breaks new
territory against the mark, participants said.
   "We know about what bad news there is about the mark, and
now we need to know what good news there will be," Mr.
Guarino said. He and Lloyd's Mr. Weir said the market is
still confident the Bundesbank can control any inflation that
results from monetary union, chiefly by raising West German
interest rates.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery dropped $3 to $375.90 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a moderate three million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $375.65 an
ounce.
