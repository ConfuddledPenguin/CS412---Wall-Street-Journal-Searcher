   The most important economic decision facing Congress this
year is whether to continue the accumulation of a Social
Security trust fund. Under current law, the Social Security
program is projected to have a surplus of $70 billion this
year and nearly $500 billion over the next five years. Sen.
Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.) and others have recently
criticized these surpluses, claiming that they are just an
accounting sham that disguises the deficit in the federal
budget and calling for a cut in the payroll tax to eliminate
them. The administration has defended the Social Security
surpluses and has proposed steps to strengthen the process of
trust fund accumulation.
   The resulting debate reopens an issue that Congress
thought it settled in 1983. At that time, in response to the
prospect of a large increase in Social Security benefits when
the baby boom generation begins retiring after 2012, Congress
voted to raise payroll tax rates immediately in order to
accumulate a substantial Social Security trust fund.

   If everything goes according to plan, no further increase
in Social Security tax rates will be needed despite the sharp
rise in the ratio of retirees to workers that will take place
after 2012. Instead, the interest earned on the accumulated
fund will supplement future Social Security tax receipts to
finance the increased benefits. And when the interest and tax
receipts aren't enough, the Social Security system will start
selling the bonds in the fund to meet benefit obligations.
   Is this really possible? Will the Social Security trust
fund really permit the benefits of the baby boom generation
of retirees to be met without raising future taxes and
therefore without cutting the consumption of those who are
then working? The answer is "yes" -- if the Social Security
surplus actually increases national saving and thus adds to
the nation's stock of plant and equipment and other forms of
capital.
   An increased capital stock can substitute for future tax
hikes (and therefore for reduced consumption of those who are
working in the future) because a larger capital stock will
mean a higher level of gross national product when the baby
boomers retire. That extra national income, much of which
will accrue directly to the Social Security system in the
form of interest on the bonds in the trust fund, can be used
to finance the consumption of the increased numbers of
retirees. And, when that extra GNP isn't enough to meet the
increased benefit obligations, selling the bonds in the trust
fund will shift resources from private investment to retiree
consumption while leaving the consumption of the working
population unchanged. Even with a reduced level of investment
in those years, the total capital stock will remain higher
and GNP greater than they would have been without the initial
accumulation of a trust fund.
   The key question is therefore whether the Social Security
surpluses and the accumulation of the trust fund actually do
increase national saving and capital formation.
   Those who attack the current surpluses claim that they do
not increase capital accumulation because they "just finance
the existing budget deficit." That argument is simply wrong.
Although it is true that the Social Security trust fund is
invested in government bonds that are issued to finance the
existing budget deficit, the impact of the Social Security
surplus on capital accumulation depends on whether those
bonds would otherwise have been bought by private investors.
If so, the purchase of those bonds by the Social Security
trust fund leaves private investors with the resources to
invest in new corporate stocks and bonds and to make loans
that finance private investment. In short, if the trust fund
buys bonds that would have existed anyway and been sold to
the general public, the Social Security surplus indirectly
finances a greater rate of private capital accumulation.
   The same point can be made in another way. It is wrong to
argue that the Social Security surplus "masks" the existing
budget deficit. The budget deficit that matters for the
nation's economic performance is the total or "unified"
deficit that includes both the Social Security surplus and
the deficit in the rest of the budget. It is the unified
deficit that the government must finance by borrowing from
the private sector and the rest of the world. An extra dollar
of Social Security surplus reduces the government's borrowing
needs by a dollar and thus adds a dollar to national saving.
   Assessing the extent to which the Social Security surplus
adds to national saving ultimately depends on a political
judgement: How large would the deficit in the rest of the
budget be if there were no Social Security surplus? If there
were no Social Security surplus now, there might well be
greater political pressure on Congress and the administration
for additional spending cuts or tax increases. If that
political pressure caused spending cuts and tax increases
equal to the current $70 billion Social Security surplus, the
Social Security surplus has no net effect on the budget
deficit or national saving.
   Although that is theoretically possible, my judgment is
that it is very unlikely that Congress and the administration
would have found $70 billion in other deficit reductions --
more than all of the deficit cuts combined over the past five
years. As a practical fact, without the Social Security
surplus, the budget deficit would be larger than it is today
and the rate of national saving would therefore be lower.
   The same logic applies to future changes in the Social
Security program. The direct impact of the Moynihan proposal
to reduce the Social Security tax rate and eliminate the
surplus would be to increase the annual budget deficit by
nearly $100 billion in 1993 and by larger amounts after that.
The government would therefore have to sell $100 billion of
additional bonds to the public that year and $100 billion of
private investment would be crowded out.
   If such a cut in the Social Security tax induced Congress
to raise other taxes and to cut spending by a total of $100
billion a year in 1993, the fall in Social Security revenue
would be neutralized. Everyone can make his own judgement
about whether that would be likely. But after watching the
difficulty with which Congress has achieved annual deficit
reductions of less than $10 billion a year for the past five
years, I doubt very much that it would suddenly find $100
billion a year of new taxes or spending cuts. The Moynihan
proposal to cut the Social Security tax would make the budget
deficit larger and the national saving rate smaller.
   To make certain that the Social Security surplus keeps
adding to national saving, President Bush has proposed a
sequel to the Gramm-Rudman legislation. The current
Gramm-Rudman law calls for a balanced budget by 1993, with
the expected 1993 Social Security surplus of $98 billion
offsetting an equal deficit in the rest of the budget. The
administration plan calls for a second phase of Gramm-Rudman
after 1993 in which the budget -- excluding Social Security
-- would be required to be balanced by 1997. Since the Social
Security portion of the budget would then have an annual
surplus equal to about 2% of GNP, the total budget would then
also show a surplus equal to about 2% of GNP. That surplus
would reduce the national debt and be a net addition to our
nation's saving and capital formation.
   Such a budget surplus could in principle be achieved
without a Social Security trust fund by other tax increases
and spending cuts. But I cannot imagine the political support
for such large tax hikes or spending cuts just for the sake
of running a budget surplus and paying down some of the
national debt. Accumulating a fund to meet future Social
Security benefit obligations without the need for future tax
increases is a politically feasible way -- probably the only
politically feasible way -- to create a desirable and
sustained surplus in the government budget.
   The currently projected Social Security surpluses are the
best hope for a major rise in America's national saving rate
in the coming decade. That could reverse the public-debt
accumulation of the 1980s and offset the adverse effect of
Social Security on private saving. Proposals to shrink the
Social Security surpluses would take us in just the wrong
direction. What is needed instead is a tougher overall budget
framework to make certain that those Social Security
surpluses become overall budget surpluses.
