   General Motors Corp., Detroit, and Fiat S.p.A. of Italy
have dissolved their six-year partnership in an automated
factory tooling venture, and settled a dispute that arose out
of the venture's work tooling up two of GM's U.S. car plants.
   As part of the transaction, GM has sold back to Fiat its
20% stake in the venture, Comau Productivity Systems Inc. of
Troy, Mich. The companies wouldn't disclose the amount Fiat
paid to GM for its Comau Productivity Systems shares. Comau
Productivity Systems will now operate as a unit of Fiat's
U.S. arm, the companies said.

   In addition, GM and the Fiat unit said they settled a
dispute that arose over the cost of tooling installed by
Comau at GM's Linden, N.J., and Wilmington, Del., car
factories. The terms of the settlement weren't disclosed.
