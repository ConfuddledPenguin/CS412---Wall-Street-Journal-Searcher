   The habit of trying to characterize the mood of a decade
in a couple of words results in a good deal of distortion.
The swinging '60s, the selfish '70s or the egomaniacal '80s
may be suggestive tags but they obviously also leave a lot
out.
   Such generalizations are especially problematical with
regard to the art of a decade, as is evident in two current
museum shows that attempt to give overviews of art created
during the past 25 years. "The New Sculpture, 1965-1975:
Between Geometry and Gesture," on view at New York's Whitney
Museum of American Art until June 3, features 10 artists who
curators Richard Armstrong and Richard Marshall think were
crucial to the redefinition of sculpture. In "Culture and
Commentary: An Eighties Perspective," which will be at
Washington's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden until May
6, guest curator Kathy Halbreich has chosen 15 artists who
came to maturity during the past decade and who she thinks
helped to shape the main cultural forces active during that
time.

   The Whitney show centers on the movement usually known as
process art or post-minimalism, which was a reaction against
the extreme understatement and stripped-down geometrical
purism of the minimalist movement. As is readily seen at the
Whitney, this was a kind of art that was purposely made not
to look like art. The materials the artists chose were often
radically unconventional, and many of the works were
purposely impermanent.
   Robert Smithson, for example, worked largely with mounds
of earth and rocks, and Barry Le Va liked to scatter pieces
of felt mixed with shiny ball bearings across hardwood
floors. In 1967 Richard Serra, now known for his aggressively
austere steel slabs, was making calligraphic wall pieces,
such as the untitled piece shown in this show, composed of
rubber strips and neon tubes.
   The exhibition is chronologically arranged. It covers the
years 1965 to 1969 on the second floor of the museum and the
early '70s on the fourth floor. Yet everything within these
divisions is so jumbled together that it is hard to get a
sense of how the individual artists developed during the
period in question. But in a show like this, the confusion
and crowding actually enhance our sense of the art by
emphasizing the sense of energy, iconoclasm and risk that the
works embody. And these are works that quite literally
redefined the nature of sculpture and the space that it
occupies, and that gave sculpture an unprecedented freedom
from both painterly conventions and the constraints of
traditional figuration. Seeing this show reminds one of the
passion and solemnity with which so many people at the time
said, "Painting is dead."
   It also was the time of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and
the art shown here originally had strong political overtones,
which no longer are readily apparent. In fact, although the
scrubby materials and the flirtation with chaos recall the
rampant iconoclasm of those years, much of the social content
of this art has become nearly invisible. At the time, many of
these works were meant not only to be anti-formal but also to
be anti-collectible, in protest against what was perceived as
the rampant materialism of the period. Now, as a result of
changed times, a number of the works in the show are
reconstructions of originals that self-destructed according
to plan but whose absence has now become a cause for regret.
To say that the anti-market stance of that period now seems
somewhat quaint is to put this phenomenon in the kindest of
lights.
   In its somewhat ambivalent critique of the market, as well
as in its emphasis on found objects, post-minimalist
sculpture descends quite clearly from the radical works of
Marcel Duchamp. Around the time of the first World War,
Duchamp acquired a number of "ready-made" objects, such as a
bottle rack, a snow shovel and a urinal, and exhibited them
as art. In doing so, he literally changed the definition of
art. A work of art no longer had to be an image that
conformed to preconceived notions of beauty, but could
instead be defined simply as an object to which meaning
accrued.
   In the '80s, by contrast, works of art frequently came to
be described primarily as objects to which money accrued. The
centrality of the marketplace is duly noted in "Culture and
Commentary," in which some of the hot tickets of the '80s are
brought together under the general heading of "art as a
reflection of culture." Or is it actually culture as a
reflection of art? No matter, for the underlying thesis of
this show seems to be that in our day and age just about
everything is interchangeable with just about everything
else. By carefully avoiding any ideological or aesthetic
commitment, this show becomes a museological equivalent of a
"Greatest Hits of the Eighties" album.
   The anthology starts with what can be read as an
unintentional metaphor, in that the very first room you walk
into seems at first to be empty. But eventually you realize
that what you took for a large box is actually German artist
Reinhard Mucha's minimalist "Gruiten" of 1985-89. A little
further on, there is a sudden but refreshing change of pace
in the form of Laurie Anderson's 1982 video, "Superman." This
is to my mind the best single work in the show. It is full of
the zany but artful intensity of Ms. Anderson's work before
she began to work in the cutesy/hip manner that made her a
pop star.
   Julian Schnabel's offering -- one wonders why David Salle
wasn't included too, just to be safe -- is, in a word,
pathetic. When I first saw the large portraits here painted
over cracked plates, I thought they were ripoffs (or, if you
must, appropriations) by someone else. But no, this and the
even more dismal black velvet "Portrait of Andy Warhol," of
1982, turn out to be by the aging "Wunderkind" himself.
   It is with enormous relief that you make your way into the
room full of English sculptor Tony Cragg's fanciful and
poetic objects. This probably is the most satisfying
installation in the show, though Mr. Cragg's "Real Plastic
Love" of 1984, a wall relief of an embracing couple composed
of brightly colored plastic objects, seems overly cute. But
then again, compared to such pure market phenomena as Jeff
Koons's garish three-dimensional cartoon of a bear talking to
a policeman, even this relatively weak piece by Cragg comes
across like a Michelangelo.
