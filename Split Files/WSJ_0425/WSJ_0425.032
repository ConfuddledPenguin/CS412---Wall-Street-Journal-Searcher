   GF Corp. (Youngstown, Ohio) -- Ronald W. Myers, previously
vice president of finance, was named president and chief
executive officer of the maker of office furniture. Mr. Myers
succeeds Ronald R. Anderson, who remains chairman. Last week,
GF and its GF Furniture Systems Inc. unit filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. The company said the appointment of Mr.
Myers was necessary to obtain $5 million in new borrowing to
resume full production of office furniture in several
manufacturing facilities.
