   San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. said first-quarter net income
jumped 56%, in part because year-earlier earnings were
depressed by a special charge.
   The utility holding company reported net before the
payment of preferred dividends of $56.1 million, or 95 cents
a share, compared with $35.9 million, or 59 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 8% to $539.5 million from $499.4
million.

   In the 1989 first quarter, California's Public Utilities
Commission disallowed the company $25 million of costs to
import power over the Southwest Powerlink.
   Thomas A. Page, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, also attributed the earnings improvement to "reduced
utility operating and maintenance costs and improved earnings
of our subsidiaries."
