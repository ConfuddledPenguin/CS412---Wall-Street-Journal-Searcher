   If Utahans have their way, Philo T. Farnsworth will become
a household name.
   Each state can place statues of two local heroes in the
U.S. Capitol. When a class of Utah fifth-graders learned
their state had only one -- of Mormon leader Brigham Young --
they sought a candidate for the other place of honor. Locals
overwhelmingly chose Mr. Farnsworth, an inventor who died in
1971 (one of Brigham Young's wives was runner-up).

   Utahans consider Mr. Farnsworth the "father of
television," the governor's spokeswoman says. "He's finally
getting his just recognition. In his lifetime, he wasn't
really recognized." A statue of Mr. Farnsworth, holding the
image-dissector tube he invented, will be unveiled May 2 in
Washington.
   Utahans claim RCA Corp., which helped make TV a success,
stole much of the glory for inventing it. Vladimir Zworykin,
an RCA employee, "was working on the concept at the same
time," says Bruce Barnson, chairman of the Farnsworth statue
committee. "He went to Philo's lab, and Philo told him the
whole thing."
   Legal battles ensued until the 1930s, when RCA (now a unit
of General Electric Co.) paid to cross license Mr.
Farnsworth's patents, the first time the company had ever
licensed a patent. "The chief patent lawyer supposedly cried
when RCA had to purchase the license," says Elliot Sivowitch,
of the Smithsonian Institution's division of electricity and
physics.
   Unfortunately, Mr. Farnsworth's patents "were too early,"
says his 82-year-old widow, Elma (her husband's first
TV-picture transmission was of her in 1929). World War II
sidelined the infant industry, and "his patents started to
expire a few years after commercial television took off."
Worse, she claims, "historians went to RCA and got history
from their PR people. Phil was largely ignored."
   "Philo T. Farnsworth is a rather controversial issue,"
concedes William Boss, a retired RCA executive and consultant
to the Electronic Industries Association. "A lot of people
were working a long time" creating television.
   Though "Farnsworth did crucial experimental work," it's
tough to name one inventor of a complex technology, says Mr.
Sivowitch. "Generally speaking, when someone says they're
first, if you look hard enough, you'll find someone who's
more first." The British, for instance, cite John Logie Baird
as TV's inventor.
