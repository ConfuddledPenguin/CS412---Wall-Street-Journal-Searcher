   DETROIT -- Sales of domestically built cars and trucks
plunged 17.7% in mid-April as auto makers posted another
disappointing performance during what should be the heart of
the spring selling season.
   "There's only one word to describe it: tough," said Clay
Lowenfield, general sales manager of a Ford and a Nissan
dealership in El Paso, Texas. Both dealerships saw sales drop
about 25% from year-earlier levels, he said.

   Overall, the 10 companies that build vehicles in the U.S.
sold 306,637 cars, trucks and vans in the April 11-20 period,
down from 372,419 a year earlier. Sales of domestically made
cars fell 19.1% from year-earlier levels, pulling the
seasonally adjusted annual selling pace for the mid-April
period down to 6.6 million cars from a robust 7.9 million
selling rate in mid-April of 1989.
   The Big Three U.S. auto makers all suffered sharp declines
in car and truck sales. The worst numbers came from Chrysler
Corp., which had a 38.8% drop in total vehicle sales. General
Motors Corp.'s total car and truck sales fell 15.5% during
the latest 10 days, while Ford Motor Co.'s car and light
truck sales skidded 19.3%.
   Among Japanese car makers, however, all but one boosted
sales of domestically built vehicles over year-earlier
levels, although that was in part because they are building
more cars in the U.S. than a year earlier. The exception was
Mazda Motor Corp., which saw sales of its two domestically
built vehicles slump 55.7% after consumer incentives expired
April 10.
   Chrysler has been struggling since the end of January,
when it halted a first-time $1,000 rebate offer on its
best-selling minivans. That offer sparked record January
sales for the auto maker. But Chrysler has suffered
double-digit sales declines in almost every 10-day sales
period since then. For mid-April, the No. 3 U.S. auto maker's
domestic truck and van sales fell 33.9% from a year earlier.
That compares with a 15.1% decline in overall domestic truck
sales during the mid-April period. Sales of domestically made
Chrysler cars tumbled 38.4% in the period.
   To stop the slide, Chrysler has reintroduced the sort of
cut-rate financing offers that helped to boost sales a year
ago. Chrysler announced Saturday that it will offer
interest-free loans for as much as two years on many of its
vehicles.
   "The last time that happened, we had people standing in
line to buy cars and trucks," said Donald Warnock, who owns a
Chrysler and a Dodge dealership in New Jersey.
   Chrysler stock was one of the most active in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, with almost 1.1
million shares changing hands. It closed at $15.875,
unchanged.
   At Ford Motor, sales of domestically built cars were down
22.7%, while sales of domestic trucks fell 13.1%. Ford
dealers said they expect the new Escort subcompact, which
goes on sale this week, to help the No. 2 auto maker bolster
its market share. "I'm looking for that to give us a real
shot in the arm," said Fred Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in
Columbus, Ohio.
   General Motors, meanwhile, outperformed Ford and the
overall market. The No. 1 auto maker's domestic car sales
dropped 18.9%, less than the overall drop in domestic car
sales. GM's domestic truck sales fell 9.6%, but that was
considerably better than the performance of the total
domestic truck market.
   The major Japanese car makers, however, did much better.
Toyota Motor Corp., which has been boosting its U.S. output,
posted a 55.3% increase in sales of its domestically produced
cars. Nissan Motor Corp. boosted sales of its U.S.-built cars
and compact trucks 31.5% in the period.
   Honda Motor Co. posted a 6.7% gain in sales of its
domestic car models. Sales of Mitsubishi Motor Corp.'s
U.S.-made cars rose 63.8%. A year earlier, Mitsubishi was
still boosting production at the Illinois factory it operates
in a joint venture with Chrysler.
