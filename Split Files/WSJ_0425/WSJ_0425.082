   NEW YORK -- He was almost at the end of a detailed
confession when his voice faltered. Michael Milken bent
forward, sobbing, as two of his lawyers rushed to support
him. Suddenly, under the vast ceiling of Manhattan's largest
federal courtroom, the world's once-most-powerful financier,
the bigger-than-life commander of the X-shaped trading desk,
seemed mortal, even frail.
   In contrast, the six felony counts to which Mr. Milken
pleaded guilty yesterday after an intense three-year
government investigation showed the financier at the height
of his power, as founder and head of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s high-yield junk-bond department. He was able to order
the country's largest arbitrager to take illegal stock
positions, to conceal the activities of corporate raiders, to
create tax losses and gains, and to create artificial prices
of junk bonds.

   The six felonies, ranging from conspiracy to securities
and mail fraud to a tax count, were far from the technical
violations of obscure securities laws that many people had
come to expect.
   Together, they portray a financier with such total power
over the junk-bond market Mr. Milken largely created that he
seemed to believe himself beyond the reach of law. And, were
it not for the unforeseen confession of a co-conspirator,
former arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, he probably would have
been.
   Four of the six counts directly involved Mr. Boesky,
establishing the accuracy of much of what Mr. Boesky told
prosecutors at the time of his own plea bargain in 1986. The
other two involve David Solomon, the head of a junk-bond
mutual fund and a former Drexel client who was granted
immunity from prosecution and has been cooperating in the
government's investigation of Mr. Milken.
   The six crimes show that Mr. Milken:
   -- Defrauded investors by unlawfully concealing the fact
that hostile suitor Golden Nugget Inc. had sold its position
in the stock of MCA Inc.;
   -- Cheated clients of Drexel and Mr. Solomon's investment
partnership by falsely reporting to them the prices at which
securities had been bought and sold, with Mr. Milken's
high-yield department pocketing the difference;
   -- Forced an unwilling Fischbach Corp. into the hands of
corporate raider Victor Posner by having Mr. Boesky take a
large and unlawfully secret position in the company's stock;
   -- Helped Mr. Solomon evade income taxes by creating
losses for him, and then manufactured gains for him the
following year;
   -- Entered into a criminal conspiracy with Mr. Boesky that
included secret record-keeping involving securities that Mr.
Boesky held in order to illegally conceal their true owners.
   -- Helped Mr. Boesky evade net-capital rules by secretly
agreeing to buy stock from him with the understanding it
would be bought back later at no loss to Drexel.
   While wide-ranging, the counts to which Mr. Milken
admitted guilt are a small fraction of the crimes alleged by
the government in its 98-count indictment or the even-larger
indictment the government said it was prepared to seek as
recently as last Friday, when Mr. Milken accepted the offer
of a plea agreement. The government said the full sweep of
Mr. Milken's allegedly unlawful behavior will be made public
in its pre-sentencing memorandum.
   Mr. Milken was warned by presiding federal district judge
Kimba Wood that the six crimes carry a maximum prison
sentence of 28 years. In addition, Mr. Milken agreed to pay a
fine of $200 million and $400 million into a fund for
restitution as part of his settlement of related Securities
and Exchange Commission charges. Judge Wood said Mr. Milken
would be sentenced on Oct. 1, after the court has had time to
consider sentencing reports from the government and Mr.
Milken's response.
   "I realize that by my acts I have hurt those who are
closest to me," Mr. Milken told the judge as his wife, Lori,
his mother, his brother, Lowell, and several former Drexel
officials looked on. "I am truly sorry. I thank the court for
permitting me to add this apology and for its fairness in
handling this complex case." Mrs. Milken wept as her husband
acknowledged guilt and apologized.
   Judge Wood asked Mr. Milken repeatedly to assure her that
he believed himself to be guilty of the crimes alleged, and
that he hadn't been pressured into pleading guilty and
relinquishing his constitutional right to a jury trial. In
each instance, Mr. Milken said that he was guilty and that he
hadn't been pressured into settlement. He also said he wasn't
taking any drugs, wasn't under the care of a psychiatrist,
and was "clear-headed."
   Both the chief government prosecutor in the case, John
Carroll, and Mr. Milken's principal lawyer, Arthur Liman,
emphasized that Mr. Milken would cooperate fully in the
government's continuing investigation of wrongdoing in the
financial industry. Mr. Carroll said the government would
retain considerable leverage over Mr. Milken even though his
cooperation will commence only after he is sentenced. The
written plea agreement provides that Mr. Milken will speak
with federal officials whenever he is asked and will "fully
and truthfully disclose all information with respect to
Drexel-related activities."
   Given his prominence in so many of the last decade's major
financial developments, from the rise of junk bonds and the
rapid growth of many now-troubled savings and loans to the
leveraged buy-out and hostile takeover booms, Mr. Milken
could be the most valuable guide to the inner workings of
Wall Street the government has ever obtained. If more
wrongdoing exists, he is in a good position to know about it.
Thus his testimony could trigger a wave of new investigations
and pleas.
   At the very least, Mr. Milken's agreement is ominous for
Mr. Posner, who was named with Mr. Milken as a defendant in
the SEC's September 1988 civil complaint. With both Mr.
Boesky and Mr. Milken cooperating, Mr. Posner's position
would seem greatly weakened.
   Robert Morvillo, an attorney for Mr. Posner, said, "The
U.S. Attorney's office has not been involved in any way with
us for a very long period of time, and we are not in the
least concerned about the Milken plea because we assume if he
tells the truth, Victor Posner will be exonerated."
   The government is also known to be investigating some
major junk-bond purchasers that were clients of Mr. Milken,
such as Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association and First
Executive Corp. Both companies have denied wrongdoing.
   As for Mr. Milken's brother Lowell, a defendant in the
indictment, the government said it would no longer seek
criminal charges against him. This was a crucial aspect of
Mr. Milken's decision to plead. In a statement distributed
after the proceeding in court, Lowell Milken said, "I can
take no satisfaction that the charges against me are being
dropped. They never should have been brought in the first
place, because I have done nothing wrong."
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, whose office approved
the settlement, characterized Mr. Milken's crimes as "some of
the most serious efforts undertaken to manipulate and subvert
Wall Street's securities markets." He added that the case
sends a strong message about "crime in the suites: Those
white-collar criminals are never so powerful or clever that
they cannot be caught by diligent and persistent law
enforcement efforts."
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, whose office also settled
its case against Mr. Milken, said he was "extremely pleased"
by the $600 million settlement, the largest in the SEC's
history. While he declined to speculate on where Mr. Milken's
cooperation might lead, Mr. Breeden said, "This case clearly
does involve some significant ramifications. We do expect the
testimony and cooperation we will receive will be valuable."
He also noted that by settling the case now, the government
will obtain Mr. Milken's cooperation before so much time
passes that the statute of limitations might bar additional
prosecutions.
   The settlement of the SEC case was filed in the same
courthouse shortly after Mr. Milken's criminal plea. In
addition to the $600 million payment, the SEC settlement bars
Mr. Milken and his brother from the securities industry for
life. Both Milkens signed consent decrees in which they
neither admitted nor denied the sweeping allegations in the
SEC's suit.
   Of the $600 million payment Mr. Milken agreed to, the $200
million that is a fine will go directly to the U.S. Treasury,
a sum that comfortably exceeds the amount the government
spent pursuing the Milken investigation, the prosecutor, Mr.
Carroll, assured Judge Wood. The $400 million portion, to be
administered by the SEC, will be available to satisfy claims
by investors and others who assert that they have been
defrauded by Mr. Milken. Although civil suits have already
been filed against Mr. Milken alleging damages far in excess
of that amount, his attorney, Mr. Liman, told Judge Wood that
he was confident $400 million would be more than adequate,
and that anything left over would go to the government.
   If nothing else, the hundreds of people packed into the
federal courtroom for the criminal plea and many hundreds
more surrounding the courthouse in Foley Square were a
testament to Mr. Milken's continuing celebrity. Entering the
courthouse through the main staircase, Mr. Milken eyed the
crowds and television crews gathered for his sentencing, and
told U.S. marshals escorting him, "It never ceases to amaze
me."
   At first, the courtroom had the almost-festive air of a
reunion. The courtroom crowd included many longtime
supporters of Mr. Milken; scores of lawyers who have worked
on aspects of the Milken and Drexel cases; a large contingent
from the U.S. Attorney's office and the SEC, and dozens of
reporters. There were titters when Mr. Milken, whom Drexel
paid $550 million in one year alone, was told the court would
appoint a lawyer for him if he couldn't afford one. But the
mood suddenly turned somber as Mr. Milken acknowledged guilt
and began describing his crimes.
   During his statement, Mr. Milken defended what will
probably be his most enduring legacy, the junk-bond market.
Although that market has been in turmoil since last fall, Mr.
Milken argued that his admission of guilt is "not a
reflection on the underlying soundness and integrity of the
segment of the capital markets in which we {Drexel}
specialized and which provided capital that enabled hundreds
of companies to survive, expand and flourish."
   Mr. Liman, commenting after the courtroom proceeding,
added that "it is Michael's hope that in the long run,
history will see his violations in context and judge him not
just on the basis of his lapses, but on the basis of the
contributions he made to the economy and to the American
people."
