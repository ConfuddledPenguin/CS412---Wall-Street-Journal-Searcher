   CINCINNATI -- Daniel J. Meyer faces a difficult, dual
task: re-establishing Cincinnati Milacron Inc. as a
world-class competitor in the cutthroat machine tool business
while restoring its traditional level of profitability.
   Mr. Meyer, Milacron's president and chief operating
officer since 1987, yesterday was named to the additional
post of chief executive officer of the maker of machine
tools, plastics machinery and robots. The 53-year-old Mr.
Meyer succeeds James A.D. Geier, 64, who will continue as
chairman until year end, when he retires.

   Mr. Meyer becomes the first chief executive who isn't a
member of the Geier family since Frederick A. Geier,
grandfather of the current chairman, bought control of the
concern nearly a century ago. All of the company's operations
will continue to report to Mr. Meyer, who was widely expected
to get the post. Directors didn't name anyone to fill Mr.
Meyer's old title of chief operating officer.
   Both competitors and analysts respect the depth of
manufacturing technology Milacron's developed under the
leadership of the retiring Mr. Geier, who headed the company
since 1970. He is credited with moving Milacron, the nation's
largest machine tool concern, into plastics machinery, robots
and electronic controls.
   But in the early 1980s Milacron got ahead of the market.
Milacron's big beige machine tools attended only by its
canary yellow robots, all controlled by computers, were the
hit of many a trade show. Few companies, however, were
willing to lay out $10 million or $20 million for the
flexible manufacturing systems in a bet that the new
technology would work.
   Meanwhile, aggressive Japanese producers -- aided by a low
value on the yen -- stole away sales. Foreign producers, led
by the Japanese, seized half of the U.S. market for machine
tools, and beat out Milacron in many foreign countries as
well. Profits plummeted.
   Mr. Meyer, a home handyman, has been putting together an
organization to fix Milacron's problems. Analysts say his
financial background already is creating a more
profit-oriented company, though results still are
unsatisfactory. He served as chief financial officer from
1977 to 1987, and was elected to the board in 1985.
   "He has to create a fine balance between the bottom line
and a commitment to advanced technology," says Eli
Lustgarten, machinery analyst with PaineWebber Inc. At the
same time, he's changing the corporate culture from "a very
paternalistic company" into a focus on profits, which takes
time, says Mr. Lustgarten.
   Milacron's sales in each of the past two years were just
over $850 million, 9% below the nearly $935 million in 1981.
And the company hasn't earned a satisfactory profit since the
1982 recession. Net income last year was $17.4 million, or 70
cents a share, and a third of that came from an extraordinary
tax credit.
   Yesterday the company reported first-quarter net income of
$2.5 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with year-earlier
profit from continuing operations of $6.2 million, or 26
cents a share. Net for the 1989 quarter, including
discontinued operations and a tax credit, was $10 million, or
41 cents a share.
   Sales rose slightly to $190.6 million from $188.3 million
a year earlier. The company had lower shipments of plastic
injection molding machines and other higher-margin products,
officials said, but they expect improved profits in the
second half.
   Milacron is moving to a focus factory approach, where each
factory specializes in one type of machine, such as lathes or
machining centers. The change from a bureaucratic, highly
centralized organization responsible for all types of machine
tools and robots is intended to increase efficiency and to
bring the people who design and manufacture the machines into
closer contact with the buyer.
   "Dan Meyer is the architect of Milacron's restructuring,
and his promotion is a vote of confidence," says
PaineWebber's Mr. Lustgarten.
   One of Mr. Meyer's reforms was pushing much of the R&amp;D
work, including that for computerized advanced manufacturing
systems, out into the focus factories. Each factory is a
profit center, which exerts discipline on product development
spending.
   The next phase for Milacron is a redesign of many machines
to make them more efficient to manufacture, Mr. Meyer says.
He cites an $80,000 vertical machining center produced by
Milacron's British unit as an illustration of the new
generation of "world competitive machines" that will
recapture market share.
