   Hallmark Cards Inc. said it completed an offer to buy back
at a discount junk bonds issued by its Univision Inc. unit.
   Hallmark, a closely held Kansas City, Mo., greeting-card
concern, said it accepted for payment $161.8 million, or 98%,
of the unit's senior subordinated discount notes due 1998.
Also, it accepted for payment $89.9 million, or 86%, of the
unit's subordinated debentures due 1999. The purchase totaled
$251.7 million of junk bonds.

   As reported earlier this month, holders of a majority of
$270 million of Univision junk bonds had voted to accept a
sweetened tender offer from Hallmark.
   Hallmark launched the tender offer in February after
Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language broadcast
concern, missed interest payments.
