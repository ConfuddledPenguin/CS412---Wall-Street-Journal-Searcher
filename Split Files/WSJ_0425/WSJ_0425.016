   Yale University and Barnard College dropped out of a
college group whose financial-aid setting practices are being
investigated by the U.S. Justice Department.
   The two schools' exit from the "overlap" group came after
government antitrust attorneys declined to give explicit
legal clearance to a meeting of the group last month. At the
meeting, the group compared financial-aid awards to students
admitted to more than one of the group's schools. Before Yale
and Barnard dropped out, overlap included 23 private
Northeastern colleges, including all eight Ivy League
schools.

   The overlap practice is under government scrutiny as a
possible form of illegal price-fixing. In past years'
meetings, common admittees' aid awards were adjusted so that
students' tuition, net of financial aid, would be about the
same no matter which school the student chose. The practice
originally was started to keep schools from "bidding" for the
best academic talent among students who needed aid.
   Just why Yale and Barnard dropped out remains unclear, but
their exit is the first tangible sign that colleges under
scrutiny have legal doubts about overlap, which they have
heretofore defended as a way to best serve students. The
government inquiry includes about 55 private schools, and
also focuses on tuition and salary-setting practices.
   Yale, of New Haven, Conn., confirmed its decision to pull
out of overlap and said it remained committed to meeting the
full financial needs of students, irrespective of means. It
declined to comment further.
   Barnard showed up at the overlap meeting at Wellesley
College in suburban Boston, according to officials at other
schools represented there, but left before substantial
discussions about aid took place. Barnard, located in New
York city, declined to comment.
   Robert Durkee, a spokesman for Princeton University, said
Barnard left after a letter from the Justice Department
arrived in Wellesley on March 26 while the meeting was in
progress. The letter emphasized that the department hadn't
given legal clearance for the meeting to take place, although
19 of the schools had asked for such a comfort letter ahead
of time.
   Mr. Durkee said attorneys from the Justice Department met
with several of the schools prior to the meeting, and were
noncommittal on the permissibility of the meeting. In his
opinion, Mr. Durkee said, neither Yale nor Barnard believes
that it has violated any laws but worried they could further
complicate their position by participating in the meeting.
   Recently, the government's investigators have asked
several of the schools, including Princeton, to supply more
data on tuition-setting practices. Mr. Durkee said that the
new request for information, which arrived this month, gives
the schools until May 1 to produce documents and other data
on how tuition was set between 1979 and 1985. The
government's prior requests covered 1985 to the present.
