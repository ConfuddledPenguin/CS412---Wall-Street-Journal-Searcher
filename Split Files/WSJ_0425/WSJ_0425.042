   As USX shareholders prepare to vote on the company's
future, they would do well to keep in mind what investor Carl
Icahn has said about his grand plan.
   "It's not magic," Mr. Icahn said in a recent newspaper
advertisement.

   The plan, of course, is for USX to spin off at least 80%
of its steel assets into a new and separate corporate entity.
The rest -- essentially USX's Marathon Oil subsidiary --
would trade in the market at $39 a share, Mr. Icahn says,
while the newly minted steel company would trade at $9.
   Voila] By this reasoning, without the company producing a
single additional barrel of oil or ton of steel, shareholders
would reap more than a 45% gain from yesterday's closing
price of 32 3/4.
   Mr. Icahn's premise -- that his plan isn't magic but is
"simple and workable" -- will be the central issue in the May
7 nonbinding shareholder vote on whether or not to recommend
a spinoff.
   Although Mr. Icahn's 13.3% stake makes him the biggest
holder of the Pittsburgh company, analysts say he faces an
uphill battle to win a majority of votes. Mr. Icahn's
calculations are being challenged by analysts, as well as by
USX management. And in taking on USX, he is battling a
company that has presided over a massive, painful
restructuring which has begun to pay off with improving
financial results.
   "I don't think Icahn has been clear enough about how the
company is worth $48 a share," says a portfolio manager for a
big institutional investor in USX. He says he plans to stick
by Charles Corry, chairman of USX, who opposes a spinoff at
least for now.
   Mr. Icahn, who once launched an abortive bid for USX and
since then has continued to loom large as a potential raider,
has yet to answer one other question.
   "If he thinks it's worth so much, why doesn't he bid to
buy the company?" says Bryan Jacoboski, a PaineWebber
analyst. "I think Icahn has another agenda." It is, Mr.
Jacoboski says, to pressure USX into repurchasing Mr. Icahn's
shares at the market price.
   Mr. Icahn, who has owned USX stock since 1986, says this
view is "absolutely incorrect," adding that he continues to
believe USX is "greatly undervalued." With respect to Mr.
Jacoboski's pointed question, Mr. Icahn says: "I would be
happy to pay $48 a share for the whole company, but on an
unfriendly basis today, I couldn't get $10 billion in
financing, and on a friendly basis, while I believe I could
get financing, it's my understanding the company wouldn't
accept a bid."
   Mr. Icahn's basic premise is that securities analysts who
specialize in either oil or steel tend to be ignorant of each
other's areas of expertise. The result, he says, is a poorly
understood company, which is shunned by Wall Street and thus
by investors generally.
   Part of Mr. Icahn's evidence is contained in a letter to
shareholders, dated April 18. The letter depicts the stock
performance since Dec. 1, 1987, of six oil companies, two
steel companies and USX. USX finishes last. "Clearly," the
letter states, "USX has failed to keep pace with the market
price increases recorded by either pure oil or steel
companies."
   But is this math or magic? Suppose, for instance, one
studies the same nine stocks from Aug. 1, 1986 -- just before
it was reported that Mr. Icahn was buying USX stock -- to the
present. Over that period, USX has finished fifth out of
nine. In other words, USX is average -- just what one might
expect from a company that is part oil, part steel.
   Mr. Icahn replies: "The real issue is that we
unquestionably believe that the company is worth more,
split." He adds: "If the company had extra money that it
didn't wish to invest in steel, why couldn't that money have
been given to shareholders? Why should the company make a
decision to go into another business without consulting
shareholders?"
   In 1982, U.S. Steel, as it was then called, bought
Marathon to smooth out the flow of cash from steel, which it
recognized as a capital-draining and labor intensive
business, vulnerable to slumps.
   In fact, in the years following the $5.9 billion
acquisition, the steel industry suffered one of its worst
recessions. But USX fared better than its rivals, largely
because Marathon sustained it as the steel side closed down
plants and suffered a strike. Similarly, Marathon benefited
from steel: Its own earnings were sheltered from taxes by the
tax-loss carry-forwards accumulated in the steel business.
   Since March 12, 1982 -- the day after Marathon agreed to
be acquired -- USX stock has risen 40%, while most steel
stocks have fallen. Bethlehem, for instance, has fallen to 17
5/8 from 20. USX has also done better than most steel
companies at maintaining and ultimately increasing dividends.
   "Our shareholders don't have to look that far back to see
some benefits of having two businesses," Mr. Corry says. He
notes that steel operations made more money in 1988 but
slowed in 1989 when oil picked up momentum.
   Mr. Corry has said he's willing to sell anything that
doesn't provide a good return -- perhaps including steel --
but not now, when the industry is again grappling with
weakness in pricing and demand, and steel assets are unlikely
to command a good price. Yesterday, USX reported lower
first-quarter net income but higher pre-tax operating income
when special items were excluded.
   Mr. Icahn, of course, is not so patient. He contends that
Marathon, if it traded alone, would be worth $39 a share --
almost 20% more than the entire company trades for today.
   In other words, if USX were to vaporize from its books the
assets of the nation's largest steelmaker, its stock would
immediately go up. Is this plausible?
   Salomon Brothers and PaineWebber say no, both arguing that
Mr. Icahn has grossly overvalued Marathon and USX's steel
assets. The two securities firms say that if a spinoff
occurred, the resulting pair of shares would trade for about
$30.
   "The enormous gap between the two goes far beyond
reasonable people sometimes disagreeing," PaineWebber's Mr.
Jacoboski says.
   Mr. Icahn's numbers are based on estimates by Kurt Wulff,
a longtime oil industry analyst that Mr. Icahn hired. Both
Mr. Jacoboski and Salomon analyst Michelle Galanter Applebaum
say Mr. Wulff errs in relying primarily on USX asset values
rather than on its cash flow.
   "The market for assets changes all the time," Ms. Galanter
Applebaum says. "Cash flow is what people actually pay for."
   Mr. Wulff doesn't dispute that he relies, primarily, on
estimating what a buyer would pay for reserves in the ground.
But he says he also takes cash flow into account, and he
defends his methods.
   Another big, unresolved issue is whether the spinoff would
be tax-free. If it weren't, shareholders might find
themselves paying unanticipated taxes. Robert Willens, a
Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst, says a spinoff must be for a
specific corporate purpose in order to be tax-free. "Merely
increasing the value of the stock isn't in and of itself a
corporate business purpose," he says. Mr. Icahn, however,
says a spinoff could be done on a tax-free basis.
   No one can say for sure what share prices would result if
a spinoff occurred. But whoever is right, if USX spins off
steel it is only the perception of value that will change,
not the intrinsic value, as defined by the cash flow from
operations.
   Mr. Icahn says the two companies, if separate, would both
be better able to raise capital. That contention is open to
question. The real point is that Mr. Icahn continues to force
the company -- as he has for four years -- to think about
spinning off shares instead of about the bottom line.
