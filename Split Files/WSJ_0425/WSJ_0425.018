   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. is considering a
plan to reduce prices of real estate the government has
repossessed and is having trouble selling.
   In a signal that it's having a tough time selling the
property, the thrift bailout agency said in a meeting
yesterday that it may slash prices below appraised values
more than originally planned. Its real-estate portfolio may
eventually total as much as $100 billion.

   RTC Chairman William Seidman compared the proposed policy
to a department store markdown, calling it the "Filene's
basement plan." Under the plan, if a property doesn't sell
after six months, the RTC could reduce the price to 15% below
the price set by private appraisers. After three more months
without a sale, the price could be reduced 5% more. After
that time, the property would be reappraised. For residential
property, the first markdown could occur after four months.
   "It's costing us every day because we are not making the
sales that we could be making," said Mr. Seidman. The RTC has
taken control of about $16.4 billion in foreclosed real
estate, but it has sold only about $2 billion of that since
the agency was created in August.
   The board delayed for two weeks any decision after Robert
Clarke, comptroller of the currency, said he was concerned
that the policy could hurt other real-estate prices. The
agency will re-examine the proposal during that time.
   The RTC said the proposed policy wouldn't violate a
provision in the savings-and-loan restructuring law that
restricts the RTC from selling real estate below 95% of the
market value in depressed areas. The agency argues that
market value shouldn't be set exclusively by appraisers, but
by what price attracts buyers.
   The RTC may also consider how to guarantee loans for some
private borrowers to finance purchases of RTC real estate,
said David Cooke, executive director of the agency.
   Separately, the RTC tapped Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.,
a Greenwich, Conn., investment banking specialist that deals
in asset-backed securities and mortgages, to act as its
adviser in setting policies for securitizing mortgages and
loans held by the RTC thrifts. In addition to the $250,000
policy contract, Greenwich will launch a pilot project to
bundle some RTC assets to be sold in blocks. The amount of
that contract will depend on the extent of the assets in the
securitization program.
