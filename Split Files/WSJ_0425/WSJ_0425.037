   TOKYO -- The leading indicator of Japan's economy
increased to 50, the so-called boom-or-bust line, in
February, the latest reporting month, and government
officials predicted that the economy will continue to expand.
   The Economic Planning Agency, which announced the
indicator, considers a reading above the line of 50 as a sign
of future economic expansion, and a reading below that level
as an indication of possible contraction ahead.

   The February reading represented a pick-up from a revised
40.9 in January.
   Earlier in the day, EPA Director-General Hideyuki Aizawa
reported to the cabinet that Japan's economy continues to
expand.
   Mr. Aizawa's April report meant that the country's economy
has continued to expand for 41 months in a row, almost
matching the second-longest, post-war expansion of 42 months,
which was set between June 1958 and December 1961.
