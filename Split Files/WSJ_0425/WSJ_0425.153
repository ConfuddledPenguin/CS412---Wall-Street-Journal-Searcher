   Equitable Resources Inc. said it expects to report that
earnings for the first quarter fell 10%, but it anticipates
full-year earnings to grow.
   In a speech to New York security analysts, Donald I.
Moritz, president of the Pittsburgh utility-holding company,
attributed the decline to unusually warm weather. The company
earned $1.14 a share a year earlier.

   Earnings for 1990 are expected to exceed year-ago net of
$2.24 a share. The company didn't elaborate.
   Mr. Moritz said he expects improvements for the year
because of increased production of natural gas, oil and
liquids; continued gains in sales of gas and services by the
company's interstate pipeline unit; and the strengthening
economy of its retail distribution area.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Equitable shares fell 50 cents to close at $35.125.
