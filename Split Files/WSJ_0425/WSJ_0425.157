   Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. expects to report that net
income for the fiscal year ending Nov. 30 was lower than the
previous year's $81.4 million, or $2.44 a share.
   Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive officer of the
Los Angeles-based single-family home builder, said after a
meeting in New York that he agreed with analysts' predictions
that earnings this year would be lower than those of a year
ago, but he declined to be more specific.

   Mr. Karatz said there has been softening in the California
real estate market, which accounts for 60% of the firm's real
estate revenue. The remainder comes from France, where the
company also is involved in commercial real estate. Mr.
Karatz said the company is spending more on aggressive
marketing and on sales incentives.
