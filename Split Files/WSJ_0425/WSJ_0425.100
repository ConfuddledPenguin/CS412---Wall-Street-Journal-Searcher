   NEW YORK -- Precious metals futures prices declined, with
silver temporarily dropping below the critical $5-an-ounce
level before recovering.
   May delivery silver settled at $5 an ounce, down 10 cents,
after trading as low as $4.99. June delivery gold ended with
a loss of $3.10 an ounce at $379.00. July platinum gave up
almost all of Monday's gains as it slipped $6.50 an ounce to
$487.80.

   Peter Cardillo, trading adviser for Josephthal &amp; Co., New
York, said one reason for the weakness in silver was traders
switching out of the May contract into more deferred months.
The first day for the issuance of notices to deliver silver
against May contracts is next Monday. The last trading day
for May silver is May 29.
   "The continued buildup of silver supplies in Commodity
Exchange warehouses and elsewhere is creating a great weight
on the market," Mr. Cardillo said.
   As of the close of trading Monday, silver inventories in
Comex warehouses amounted to a record 255.4 million troy
ounces, an increase of 3.4 million ounces from Friday.
   Mr. Cardillo noted that precious metals traders also
appeared to be less concerned about inflation than people in
other commodity markets.
   "A good example is the way precious metals traders ignored
the unexpectedly large rise in durable goods orders in
March," he said. "They seem to feel that it's a temporary
blip that will correct itself later on."
   Durable goods orders for March rose 6.7% in contrast to a
rise of 2.3% in February and an expected increase of only
2.1%.
   Silver these days is selling about 55 cents to 60 cents
below production costs, Mr. Cardillo said. "Eventually, this
is going to cause some of the smaller and less strongly
financed producers to close down. In time, this will create a
support for prices. However, over the near term, I don't see
prices declining much more," he said.
   The dollar wasn't much of a factor either, according to
another analyst who noted, "It was up against the yen, but
down against the German mark and Swiss franc and even with
sterling."
   Another analyst, Gregory Klochkoff, vice president of Bank
of Boston in Providence, R.I., said there was some demand for
gold early in the session, but "traders later in the day sold
out when they became disappointed with the market's
lackluster performance."
   However, he noted, light Middle Eastern demand developed
for gold bullion in the latter part of the day. These
purchases created some underlying support in the futures
market and helped prices level off, he said.
   Ian MacDonald, vice president at Credit Suisse in New
York, noted that "the market lacked news and like most
markets these days, it's news-driven."
   Mr. MacDonald also noted that producers tend to sell
precious metals more actively in the early part of the year
and that these sales tend to taper off later. "Jewelry demand
for precious metals has slowed and the observance of
religious holidays in the Middle East also has contributed to
a decline in demand," he said.
   The modest buying that appeared in futures early in the
day apparently was prompted by the belief that the market may
have been oversold and might respond to some demand.
"However, the market failed to rally, producing the later
sell-off," he said.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn, soybean and wheat
futures contracts dropped amid profit-taking and forecasts
for good planting weather. Corn prices eased as some traders
began cashing in on a modest rally that lasted several weeks.
"It was just a technical correction from the recent price
gains," said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean
Witter Reynolds, Chicago. Soybean prices, which rose for the
past few weeks, also dropped. According to published reports
in Brazil, the soybean harvest there is nearing the halfway
point. Last year at this time the Brazilian harvest was 58%
complete. The slow harvest has been widely reported and had
little impact on prices yesterday. Brazil and the U.S. are
the two largest soybean exporting nations. In the U.S., soil
moisture appears adequate as the planting season begins in
the Midwest in earnest. Corn farmers have planted about 6% of
their fields so far. The biggest problem is the spring wheat
growing region of the Northern Plains, where the weather has
been extremely dry. Some forecasters expect showers over much
of the area later this week, which would increase the chances
of normal germination.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum futures were mixed. June crude oil
settled slightly lower after an early run-up failed to reach
certain technical targets. West Texas Intermediate for June
delivery rose to $19.47 a barrel but then sold off sharply.
It settled at $19, down seven cents for the day. "The market
is finding a niche for the spot-month crude at around $19,"
said one trader, "until it's clear whether OPEC will cut
crude supplies at the meeting next week." Contributing to the
sell-off, some other traders suggested, was a worry that the
latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute
would show another increase in crude oil inventories.
Released after trading had closed, the API report did show
that crude oil inventories increased 1.2 million barrels last
week. Still, one trader called it a "non-event" so far as
crude futures prices are concerned. Also, as expected, the
closely watched API report showed drawdowns in inventories of
gasoline and distillate fuels, including heating oil.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rebounded from the weakness of the
previous two sessions. The May contract rose 3.40 cents a
pound to $1.1550. Demand for contracts was helped by a report
that durable goods purchases in March had risen 6.7%, up from
a 2.3% increase in February and compared with expectations of
only about a 2.1% gain, one analyst said. Also, the analyst
noted, production problems being experienced by Codelco, the
Chilean state-owned copper mining company, was a
price-supporting factor. Chile is the world's largest copper
producer. At one mine, the motor of a mill concentrator
hasn't been working at full capacity and "rock bursts," or
collapses, in some mines have been a continuing problem, the
analyst said. Codelco late yesterday lowered its estimate for
1990 production to 1.2 million to 1,250,000 tons of refined
copper from its previous estimate of 1,290,000 tons,
according to the analyst. He said output would most likely be
closer to 1.2 million tons. Dealer premiums for cash market
copper in the U.S. and abroad remain strong, according to the
analyst, who also said that computer-based commodity funds,
which have been sellers in futures markets recently, became
buyers yesterday and helped boost prices.
