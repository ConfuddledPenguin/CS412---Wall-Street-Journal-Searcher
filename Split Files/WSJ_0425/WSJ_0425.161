   Tambrands Inc., Lake Success, N.Y., reported that net
income rose 22% for the first quarter, fueled by strong
shipments of tampons in the U.S.
   The company earned $22.1 million, or $1.02 a share,
compared with $18 million, or 81 cents a share, in the
year-earlier quarter. Revenue increased 23% to $159.3 million
from $129.9 million.

   Analysts said the unexpected steep increase in revenue was
magnified by weak revenue last year. A 9% decline in research
and development expenditures, coupled with a 13% drop in
general and administrative costs, helped fuel earnings
growth.
   The percentage increase in per-share earnings exceeded the
percentage increase in net income because Tambrands has
repurchased its own shares since the first quarter of last
year.
   In New York Stock exchange composite trading, Tambrands
closed at $76.125 a share, down 12.5 cents.
