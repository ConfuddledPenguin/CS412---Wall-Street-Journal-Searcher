   DALLAS -- Blaming "disappointing" production results, the
Hunt brothers' Placid Oil Co. said it was abandoning the
risky Green Canyon drilling project that the fallen oil
tycoons gambled would be their return ticket to prosperity.
   Located in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the
controversial $340 million project involved using an
experimental floating rig to drill to unprecedented depths in
search of what brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert
Hunt and Lamar Hunt contended was a 70-million barrel oil
reserve.

   According to a report in the Oil and Gas Journal, one of
Placid's wells at Green Canyon -- drilled in 2,243 feet of
water -- set a world water depth record for production. But
equipment problems plagued the project from the start and the
gusher anticipated by the high-rolling Hunts never appeared.
   While a major blow to the Hunts' efforts to rebuild at
least part of their oil empire, Placid officials said Green
Canyon's failure did not mark the end of the company's
exploration efforts. "We're involved in looking for oil in a
lot of other places," said P.G. Clark, Placid's vice
president of operations. "We're just not going in deep
water."
   Mr. Clark declined to discuss details regarding the Green
Canyon project's production problems. But last November
Dallas-based Enserch Corp., which owned a 25% working
interest in the project, reported that the only two producing
wells at the site were yielding a meager 200 barrels of oil
and eight million cubic feet of gas per day.
   "It apparently didn't get any better," said
Prudential-Bache analyst Tom Driscoll.
   "I think you could reuse a whole lot of the equipment at
another location so long as you actually did find
commercially producable quantities," said Tom Marsh, drilling
editor for Houston-based Offshore Data Services Inc.
   Mr. Marsh noted, however, that the hugely expensive Green
Canyon project was conceived in the days when oil was selling
for $30 a barrel.
   Green Canyon's failure marks the end of another
controversial chapter in the brothers' decade-long financial
decline and comes just one month after the Hunts lost their
remaining interest in Penrod Drilling Co. and its prized
fleet of off-shore drilling rigs.
   Like Placid, the family's exploration arm, Penrod had been
owned by the trust estates of Hunt brothers.
   Despite widespread industry skepticism about its
prospects, the Hunts wagered that the Green Canyon project
would help them dig out from under the $2 billion mountain of
debt resulting from their disasterous speculation in the
1979-80 silver market.
