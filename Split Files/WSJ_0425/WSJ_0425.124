   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency is
considering a range of recycling proposals designed to reduce
emissions of air conditioning coolants and other chemicals
that damage the stratospheric ozone layer.
   These chemicals -- chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs -- are
frequently released when auto and commercial air conditioning
and refrigeration units are serviced. The EPA proposals,
which include mandatory and voluntary recycling programs, are
designed to ensure that the chemicals are reused, rather than
released into the atmosphere.

   The ozone layer helps shield the Earth from harmful
ultraviolet radiation, which causes skin cancer.
   President Bush has committed the U.S. to phase out the
production and importation of CFCs by the year 2000, under an
international treaty process. An EPA official explained that
recycling could cut $2 billion from industry's estimated $4.7
billion cost of phasing out CFCs and halons, another
ozone-depleting chemical, by 2000.
   A notice inviting public comment on the proposals will
appear in the Federal Register soon.
   Initially, the program would focus on the motor-vehicle
air conditioning industry, which accounts for 21% of CFC use
in the U.S. The agency estimates that 63% of CFC use in the
U.S. occurs in industries where recycling is feasible.
