   NEW YORK -- Short interest among the over-the-counter
market's largest stocks slipped 1.3% as of mid-April, but
short interest in smaller OTC stocks climbed 28.3%.
   Among individual issues, shares of Los Angeles-based First
Executive, once a large holder of junk bonds, again led the
list of stocks with the largest short positions, reclaiming
the spot it held in February. The short interest in the
holding company edged up 0.8%.

   Short interest in Intel surged 64.8%, putting the Santa
Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker second among the list of
companies with largest short interest.
   On the other hand, the American depositary receipts of
Reuters Holdings PLC, the information service company, gave
back nearly all the short interest gained last month, when
that company catapulted to the top of the volume list. The
short interest in Reuters fell 10,703,497 shares, to
1,784,218, or 85.7%, compared with last month's rise of
10,710,267 shares.
   Robert Cooke, director of media relations for Reuters
America, the U.S. affiliate of London-based Reuters, said it
appears that eight million of last month's 10,710,267 share
increase involved a block sold short by a U.S. brokerage firm
to a large institutional holder to capture the company's
higher dividend. Another 1.5 to two million shares involved
arbitrage with Eurobonds held by one large holder that were
convertible into Reuters ADRs.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency for the OTC markets, reported that
short interest in 2,366 National Market System issues, the
largest OTC stocks, slid to 253,333,653 shares at mid-April
from 256,738,458 in mid-March among 2,343 issues.
   However, short interest in 1,286 smaller stocks traded on
the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations system rose to 43,909,145 shares as of April 12,
from 34,230,850 as of mid-March in 1,294 issues.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture, as in the case of Reuters.
   The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-April fell to 2.69 from 2.83 a month earlier, while the
short-interest ratio for other OTC issues climbed to 1.27
from .88 in mid-March.
   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily volume that would be required to cover the
total short interest position -- is a measure of negative
trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however, that the
ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options
and other products can be used to hedge short positions.
   Nasdaq stocks that showed the largest percentage increases
in short interest involved Cobe Laboratories, a Lakewood,
Colo., concern that recently agreed to merge with Gambro AB,
a Swedish medical equipment maker. Coda Energy, a
Dallas-based oil and gas concern, showed the largest
percentage drop in short interest. Last month the company
adopted anti-takeover measures.
   The adjacent tables show the National Market System issues
in which a short position of at least 50,000 shares existed
at April 12 or in which the short position had changed by at
least 25,000 shares from mid-March (see accompanying tables
-- WSJ April 25, 1990).
