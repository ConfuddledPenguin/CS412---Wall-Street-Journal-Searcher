   You may be unnecessarily alarmist ("Tiananmen in Vilnius?"
editorial, March 27), as Mikhail Gorbachev has backed down on
other issues where he formerly vowed he would never retreat.
Still, the Lithuanians might be better off to try for a
face-saving compromise, such as a one-year postponement of
independence.
   Offering to keep Soviet military bases, and join the
Warsaw Pact, would make sense. Also, the Russian province of
Kaliningrad (Konigsberg), formerly the north half of German
East Prussia, would need guarantees of free transit.

   Lithuania, although 80% Lithuanian, has some minorities of
Byelorussians, Poles, Russians, etc. who deserve guarantees
of fair treatment. It would be reasonable to conduct
plebiscites in the far south and east, to readjust boundaries
in contiguous areas containing majorities of Byelorussians or
Poles, in the slice of territory, formerly Polish, that was
added to Lithuania by Stalin after World War II.
   Other Soviet republics have similar, but worse, problems
of minorities within minorities, due to misdrawing of
boundaries, internal migration (forced and voluntary), and
Stalin's divide-and-rule policies. Moldavia, for instance
(formerly part of Romania) contains a large Ukrainian
minority, while there are Moldavians in some adjacent
Ukrainian provinces. Georgia contains Abkhazians and
Ossetians in "autonomous provinces." Kazakhstan has only 50%
Kazakhs, due to large-scale resettlement of Russians into its
western part. Within the Russian republic, there are
"autonomous" republics, provinces and districts of many
nationalities, such as Tatars, Karelians (near Finland) and
Eskimo-related groups in the far north.
   Unscrambling this situation and redrawing boundaries would
test the wisdom of Solomon, and many Russians rightly fear
that they would have to flee as refugees if the situation got
nasty.
   A postponement by Lithuania would save face but still give
many options. The reformers in the Soviet Parliament could
propose orderly secession procedures. Secessionists in
Central Asia or Ukraine could escalate their demands, making
it easy for the Baltic republics to slip quietly away. The
Soviet army could collapse, like the Austro-Hungarian army in
1918 at the end of World War I, with soldiers of different
nationalities straggling back to their home provinces.
   As in the ancient story of the prisoner who escaped
execution by convincing the king that he could teach the
king's horse to talk -- "The king could die, I could die, the
horse could die -- or the horse could learn to talk."
