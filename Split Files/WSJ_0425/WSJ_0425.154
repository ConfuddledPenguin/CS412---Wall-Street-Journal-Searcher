   McKesson Corp., blaming a decline in profit at a unit and
a $20 million pretax provision for customer accounts, said
fourth-quarter net dropped 28%, to $18.3 million, or 40 cents
a share, from $25.4 million, or 61 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the March 31 quarter rose 11% to $2.1 billion,
from $1.9 billion.

   The San Francisco-based drug distribution company said the
decision to increase reserves for customer accounts reflected
concern over the weakened financial condition of some of its
retail customers.
   The rise in reserves is reflected principally in the
results of McKesson's drug distribution business, with lesser
amounts charged against the service merchandising segment and
Armor All Products. Profit at the 83%-owned Armor car-care
products unit was disappointing, the company said, in part
because the company curtailed special year-end promotions.
   For the year, net slipped nearly 2%, to $98.7 million, or
$2.23 a share, from $100.6 million, or $2.38 a share, in
fiscal 1989. Revenue rose almost 11% to $7.8 billion from $7
billion.
