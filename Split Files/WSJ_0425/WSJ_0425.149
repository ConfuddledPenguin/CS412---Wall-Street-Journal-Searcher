   BUSH DEFERRED any sanctions against the Soviet Union over
Lithuania.
   Reflecting both continued hope for negotiations and U.S.
allies' unwillingness to support such curbs, the president
said that he currently won't take any steps that might
provoke a Kremlin backlash and scuttle chances for a
settlement of the standoff over Lithuania's independence bid.
The decision, which was announced after Bush met with
congressional leaders, followed days of debate within the
administration about whether to cancel talks with Moscow on
economic issues.

   THE SHUTTLE BLASTED into orbit, carrying the Hubble Space
Telescope.
   Preparing to open a long-delayed era in the exploration of
the universe, Discovery streaked through a bank of clouds at
Cape Canaveral, Fla., and soared to a record-high 380-mile
orbit. The five astronauts tested the $2.5 billion telescope,
which is to be released today. The 12-ton device is expected
to enable astronomers to peer into space almost to the
beginning of time. The first pictures from the telescope are
expected to be relayed to Earth in about seven days.
   The launch of the Hubble telescope has been delayed since
1983 because of technical problems and the 1986 explosion of
the space shuttle Challenger.

Simmons, who killed 16 people in a 1987 rampage.
