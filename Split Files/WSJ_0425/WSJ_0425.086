   "We are the biggest auto insurer in New Jersey," said the
visitor to the Journal a few months ago. "We had a market
share of 22%, it's now 15% and now we'd like it to be much,
much smaller." What? Hoping to lose market share? Indeed,
what might have made the morose official happiest would have
been to change the name of his employer to
Allstates-but-New-Jersey Insurance Co.
   Allstate has done the next best thing. On March 12, New
Jersey Gov. Jim Florio made good on his campaign pledge to
sign an auto-insurance "reform" bill. On April 9, Allstate
sued, with no constitutional holds barred. The case styled
Allstate v. James F. Florio, in his official capacity as
Governor of the State of New Jersey and in his individual
capacity is a refreshing chest-beat by an American company
against destructive government regulation. Win, lose or draw,
this case could be a model for the angry business plaintiff.

   New Jersey has brutal insurance rates (an average of
$1,000 a year) and the lowest profits of any state for
insurers. Drivers have every reason to be livid, but the
Florio plan to sock the insurers is no solution. The real
target must be the state's notorious pocket-picking courts.
The tort crisis has now given way to a constitutional crisis,
featuring legislation mandating an average 20% cut in
premiums.
   Gov. Florio is a Democrat, but both parties are to blame
for the New Jersey mess. The end of anything approaching an
actual insurance market began in the early 1970s with a
no-fault system that quickly became a no-way-defendant-wins
system; huge lawsuits became commonplace on top of the
no-fault liability. Pay-outs soared yet regulators forced
rate cuts. Soon many high-risk drivers couldn't find
insurance.
   Over the objection of insurers, the state created pools
for these drivers with names such as Assigned Risk Plan and
Joint Underwriting Association. These schemes forced insurers
to cover high-risk drivers but didn't allow them to charge
premiums to match their risks. Half the state's drivers have
been in the pool, subsidized by the other half of the drivers
and by the losses sustained by insurers.
   Gov. Florio's bill abolishes the Joint Underwriting
Association, but by forcing insurers to pony up $1.4 billion
of the current $3.1 billion deficit. Drivers will stop paying
more than $200 extra as their contribution to the pool. Also,
insurers won't be able to use factors such as gender and age
in setting rates. A 50-year-old housewife in the suburbs with
a perfect driving record will pay the same as an 18-year-old
man in Newark. Three insurers now plan to stop writing
policies in the state.
   "This lawsuit was not a very easy thing for a regulated
business like ours to do," Michael Duncan says. He's the
Journal visitor above and the assistant general counsel for
Allstate responsible for this lawsuit. "A regulated business
for the most part works awfully hard even at some costs to
itself to get along with the awesome power the state has over
it. But it's like when a bully on your block has you down on
the ground and you're afraid to hit him back because he'll
hit you again. Sometimes you just have no choice."
   Mr. Duncan spent several weeks looking for just the right
lawyers to litigate the case. He says, "We knew we wanted to
treat this case a little differently, to attack this problem
as the creation of a regulatory system based in politics. The
history is that this state through mismanagement and
irresponsible and incompetent regulation created the crisis."
   He picked Floyd Abrams of Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, at
first an odd choice since Mr. Abrams is best known for First
Amendment law and liberal politics. But despite the
plaintiff, this is a civil-rights case. University of Chicago
Law Professor Richard Epstein, a top scholar on property
rights, is also advising Allstate.
   The lawsuit against Gov. Florio cites several possible
constitutional infringements of economic liberties, including
some so rarely invoked these days they may be unfamiliar:
   Taking without just compensation: The New Jersey
Department of Insurance issued a report in 1989 that auto
insurers made profits nationwide but over the previous 13
years had an operating loss of more than $500 million in New
Jersey. Allstate expects $40 million a year in added losses
just to pay its share of the Joint Underwriting Association
bailout.
   The firm says in its complaint that the "confiscatory
nature" of the law means it won't get a "fair, adequate or
reasonable rate of return." It cites the Fifth Amendment
prohibition against taking for a public purpose without
compensation.
   Violation of due process: "The overall statutory scheme,"
the complaint says, "is so arbitrary and capricious as to
constitute a denial of the due process guaranteed by the 14th
Amendment."
   Impairment of the obligation of contract: Allstate is one
of several insurers that had a contract with the state Joint
Underwriting Association. The suit notes that the contract
"expressly provided that servicing carriers could not be held
liable for JUA losses or claims." Mr. Abrams says one reason
he was interested in handling this case is its "clear breach
of faith and governmental misbehavior" now to demand that
insurers bail out the fund. The contracts clause prohibits
states from "impairing the obligation of contracts,"
including their own.
   Bill of Attainder: The Constitution prohibits elected
officials from holding trials and establishing the guilt of
private parties, which is precisely what Allstate says New
Jersey has done. The complaint cites candidate Florio's
campaign promise to "send the JUA bill where it belongs: to
the insurance companies." In its findings for the new law,
the state Legislature asserted that "mismanagement by the
insurance companies" cost the JUA nearly $1 billion.
"Allstate and the other insurance companies have," the suit
says, "been tried, convicted and punished by the
legislature."
   It's impossible to predict who will win in court, but at
least Allstate is on the offensive. "They call themselves the
good-hands people," Gov. Florio demagogued at a news
conference. "The question is which part of our anatomy do
they have their good hands around?" He sent a letter to
Allstate President Wayne Hedien telling him to "be assured
that a lawsuit will provide the people of New Jersey the
opportunity to look at Allstate's books."
   Gov. Florio also sent a letter to his insurance
commissioner noting that Allstate "has hired attorneys from
New York and Chicago." He demanded quarterly reports from
Allstate of its litigation costs.
   This lawsuit may be Allstate's best chance to make its
case about who destroyed the insurance market. "We are
perceived by the public as being a big, strong industry.
Political cartoons in New Jersey have little Jimmy Florio
trying to box against the huge giant of insurers," he says.
"But we have a Constitution aimed at limiting governmental
power. Our case is not about economic regulation, but about a
state trying to punish us for what the government says we did
to hurt consumers, but that actually the government did."
   New Jersey taxpayers must now bear the costs of defending
the governor from this lawsuit. These costs will be a bargain
if everyone leaves court understanding that the state's
insurance problem is too much regulation, not too little.
