   New York -- Pierre Berge was over here earlier this month
hoping to raise some money for the Opera Bastille in Paris.
As it happens, I was in Paris at the Bastille at the very
same time, trying to give him some. I hope Mr. Berge had an
easier time of it.
   Mr. Berge is the director of all the opera theaters in
Paris, and thus chief of the Bastille, the new opera house
whose delayed opening kept so many of us entertained for so
long. I am confident that the Bastille's stage one day will
offer a spectacle even more satisfying than Mr. Berge's
firing of artistic director Daniel Barenboim, he of the
inflated conducting talent, huge salary and house-sized ego.
But that day still is in the future.

   I say this having finally caught up with "Les Troyens,"
the epic opera by Hector Berlioz that had opened the house
last month to a generally friendly reception from most papers
including our own. Perhaps I too would have belatedly joined
the chorus of praise meeting this rare presentation of a work
whose complexity and prodigious length is such an immense
challenge to performers and audience alike. But I already was
in a weakened state when the curtain rose.
   If the gate to Troy had been guarded by the same
"bouldogue" who sits in the Bastille box office, history
would be different. Anyone contemplating a visit to the
Bastille better be ready for a long siege.
   "If you don't give me my ticket, I'll kill you]" I thought
the American on line in front of me was out of control,
shouting like that into the ticket window. Then it was my
turn.
   I had done everything to assure a smooth entry into
architect Carlos Ott's opera house. Heaven knows you don't
want to linger outside this charmless melange of concrete,
stone and steel already showing the clammy hand of Parisian
pollution.
   From a sullen press office, our Paris bureau had extracted
the promise of a 540franc ($95) ticket to be picked up at the
box office. (The "people's opera," as the Bastille likes to
call itself, must be redefining class structure.)
   "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" the "vache" now mooed, staring at a
piece of paper with my reservation number as if I had just
handed her a small bomb. (Next time]) But it isn't every day
you actually get a question straight out of a beginner's
French manual. "C'est mon numero de dossier]" I responded
eagerly. Above me, a TV monitor -- just one of the many
modern gadgets accoutering this triumphantly high-tech house
-- was running rehearsal scenes showing Shirley Verrett as
broken-hearted Dido, flopping to the floor in deep despair.
   But what really did the Queen of Carthage know about the
deepest depths of despair? She never had to buy a ticket to
her own opera] Which is what I proceeded to do for the next
hour.
   4:50 p.m.: Much puzzled staring into the computer. "Maybe
it comes."
   "Where's it coming from? It's supposed to be here."
   (Shrug)
   5:10, back to the same window. Blank-faced reception. "No,
not here. Next window."
   The next window. "Yes, I see the number. But there is no
ticket. For the ticket you must go to the next window."
   Which is the original window. Back on line. Boy, can't
wait to see Verrett flop down in real life, now that I've
seen it on tape at least nine times. It was 5:20. There was
still no ticket.
   In between I tried information, which had no information
and sent me back to the box-office harpy.
   "What is your name? WHAT? WHAT?"
   This went on for the next five minutes while other
customers, nearly as desperate, broke into the line. Golly,
Shirley has certainly put on weight. Back to the window.
"WHAT? WHAT?"
   "Ache comme Hector, O comme Olympe, E comme Elpenor . . ."
Suddenly, at 5:40, "mirabile dictu", the ticket mysteriously
walked itself into the computer. Now all I had to do was pay
for it. I gave her my credit card and got another "Is this a
bomb?" look.
   Well, the Bastille is a high-tech kind of place, but as
Pier Luigi Pizzi, the show's designer, found out, they're
still working on the technology. He was told to design sets
that could be pushed on stage manually because the Bastille's
incredibly expensive turntables don't turn.
   It was now 10 minutes to curtain time, and I was turning.
I was turning my pockets inside out, shedding coat and
jacket, looking for 540 francs. The credit-card telephone
hookups weren't working either.
   I found 520 francs. Wait] Here's more. 535 francs] I
pushed the crumpled heap of bills through the grill and
begged. I told her how I'd come all the way from America and
how I loved Berlioz best among composers, even more than
Auber. EVEN MORE THAN ADOLPHE ADAM.
   Nothing doing. Only 540 francs would satisfy her and no,
she would not give me a cheaper seat, because the evening was
sold out.
   A small crowd gathered, attracted by my howls. Was I ever
grateful to the preux "chevalier" who stepped over the little
piles of clothing and torn-out hair to give me the missing
five francs, though I would have been even more grateful had
he also given me a food allowance.
   I was now flat broke and condemned to five hours of song
and a one-hour intermission without even enough cash to pay
for a benzene-laced Perrier. That the trio of clean-plate
clubbers onstage clearly hadn't missed a meal in years only
made my agony complete. Neither was this empty feeling
mitigated by Grace Bumbry's totally unmemorable performance
as Cassandra or Ms. Verrett, in slightly better shape,
mysteriously bewailing the departure of a thoroughly
dislikable, tin-voiced Aeneas. The best part was Mr. Pizzi's
sophisticated evocation of doomed civilizations, though the
boat taking Aeneas to Italy did make me wonder just how I was
going to get home.
   No wait, that wasn't the best part. The best part was
going to this paper's Paris office and finding a note from
the bureau chief. He was hoping I might reimburse him for the
540 francs he had prepaid with the Bastille press department.
