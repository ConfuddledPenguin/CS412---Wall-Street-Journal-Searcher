   ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands -- Back when Morris Tabaksblat
was supervising Unilever Group's drive into the U.S. perfume
business, his wife and daughter used to greet him expectantly
each night, hoping for a sample of the latest scent.
   Nowadays, Mr. Tabaksblat creates a little less excitement
when he comes home. As Unilever's top food executive, he is
more likely to be bearing a new kind of low-fat frozen dinner
than a vial of perfume.

   If frozen dinners are less glamorous than some of
Unilever's recent diversifications, the Anglo-Dutch company
still has a lot more money riding on food than on perfume or
cosmetics. Indeed, Unilever's decision to bring Mr.
Tabaksblat back from the U.S. last autumn was a sign the
company wants to push harder for growth in its traditional
businesses.
   With annual food sales of about $17 billion, Unilever is
the world's third-largest food company, after Nestle S.A. and
Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft General Foods unit. Because of its
world leadership in margarine and such brands as Lipton tea,
Unilever derives half of its profit from food, the rest
coming mostly from detergent, toiletries and specialty
chemicals.
   But many of Unilever's mainstay food businesses -- from
margarine and tea to soup -- offer little opportunity for
growth in Western Europe, which accounts for nearly
two-thirds of the company's food sales. Only 20% of its food
sales come from the vast U.S. market, and a meager 15% from
what Unilever describes as "the rest of the world." So
Unilever is trying to broaden both its geographical spread
and its menu of products.
   "They need to find markets with some growth in them," says
Richard Workman, an analyst at the London brokerage firm
Hoare Govett.
   Mr. Tabaksblat is chairman of a new, three-man team
charged with doing just that. The three men will scour the
world for food ideas that can be transplanted from one market
to another, and improve coordination of Unilever's highly
fragmented food operation, with more than 100 factories in
Europe alone.
   The new powers given to Mr. Tabaksblat and his colleagues,
Niall FitzGerald and Alexander Kemner, are "designed to shake
things up," says David Lang of Henderson Crosthwaite, another
London brokerage firm. "They really mean this. I think they
feel they've underperformed."
   Not that Unilever's food business has been going stale.
The company has wrung out higher profit margins in Europe by
stressing "quality convenience" foods, such as the Du darfst
low-fat range in West Germany and the hot-selling Healthy
Options frozen dinners in Britain. It has also boosted
profits in the stagnant European margarine market by offering
a variety of low-fat spreads.
   In the U.S., the company has used such brands as Country
Crock, Promise and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter to raise
its share of the margarine market to nearly 40% from 10% in
the early 1980s. Coupled with cost cutting, these marketing
efforts have raised Unilever's operating profit margins on
food to 9% in 1989 from 6% five years before.
   But such gains are becoming more difficult in Unilever's
strongholds, a problem that underlies the need to branch out.
In the past, says Floris Maljers, co-chairman of Unilever,
the company concentrated too much on foods popular in
Northwestern Europe and the U.S. Now it must learn how to
please palates in Latin America, Africa and Asia, he says.
   Because Unilever thinks that Italian food travels well, it
is betting heavily on its line of Ragu pasta sauces, acquired
in 1987 as part of the $3.1 billion purchase of
Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. Ragu is by far the biggest U.S. brand
in its category, and Unilever is trying to repeat that
success in Europe, Mexico and Australia.
   Unilever also hopes to find far-flung markets for Boursin,
a French brand acquired last year to bolster its $400 million
a year cheese business.
   Transplants of this sort would help Unilever improve its
geographical balance. An obvious target is the U.S. market,
where Unilever is represented primarily by its successful
Thomas J. Lipton Inc. unit, a maker of tea, soup, side dishes
and such so-called novelty items as Fun Fruits candy. Jay H.
Freedman, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York,
calls it a "hidden jewel" and says it "may be the best food
company in the U.S." But Unilever has barely touched big
parts of the U.S. market, including frozen foods, which are
the core of its European business. Because of such gaps, many
analysts expect Unilever's next big acquisition to be a U.S.
food company.
   Mr. Tabaksblat confirms that Unilever is shopping for U.S.
food makers, adding that he hopes the demise of
junk-bond-financed raiders means fewer bidders to drive up
the prices. Even so, he notes, Unilever is more likely to
continue building its U.S. food business through small and
midsize acquisitions rather than by making one big splash --
"unless something that fits us like a glove comes along."
   The "rest of the world" is another frontier for Unilever.
The company has long sold soap and detergent almost
everywhere, but it has barely scratched the food market
outside Europe and the U.S. Mr. Tabaksblat sees big
opportunities in Latin America and Asia. "The time now is
ripe for really giving a push there," he says.
   Thus, Unilever has been snapping up food companies in
Brazil, Chile and Mexico. It has a new ice cream plant in
Thailand, and it is building one in Turkey. In India,
Unilever is promoting a new brand of cookies, a product that
the company doesn't make elsewhere. A tea company, Unilever
is also experimenting with chicory-flavored instant coffee in
India.
   Unilever's sales in Japan remain tiny, but Mr. Tabaksblat
has high hopes there for a new frozen dish called Fish Oh]
Fingers. And with what some may consider audacity, Unilever
is even thinking about competing head-to-head with the
Japanese by making a new version of their traditional drink:
green tea.
