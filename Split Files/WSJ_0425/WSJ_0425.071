   When demand for cars is weak, Detroit rushes out rebates
and cut-rate financing plans in an effort to attract
customers.
   But that isn't the way it works on Wall Street.

   As low demand for stocks and other investments continues
to depress commission revenues, the big, full-service
brokerage firms are making individual investors pay more for
their accounts.
   "There's no question that firms are feeling the revenue
pinch and are taking steps to alleviate it," says Hardwick
Simmons, chairman of the private client group at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. "They're looking in places that should
have been looked at before but that, for one reason or
another, the better markets obscured."
   Among the places they're looking, Wall Street executives
concede, is the customer's pocketbook. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
and Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. have raised posted
commission rates by an average of 6% to 10% since early last
year.
   Fees are up 23% on Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Cash Management
Accounts, which combine a basic brokerage account with a
money-market fund, check-cashing privileges and other
services. PaineWebber Inc. is also considering price
increases on similar accounts.
   At the same time, more and more servicing costs that used
to be profitably covered by commission revenues are now being
"unbundled" and passed on directly to the customer.
Traditional "freebies" -- such as sending out monthly account
statements, handling dividend and interest payments and
back-office processing of trades -- are becoming separate
services the investor has to buy.
   Even investors who don't trade are feeling the bite. Every
major Wall Street broker except Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. now
imposes a so-called inactive account fee on investors who
don't generate enough commissions, either individually or per
household.
   The firms say the charges are relatively inexpensive for
the custodial services they offer -- well below what
comparable trust services would cost elsewhere. "The industry
is going through a process of `fairness' -- getting paid for
services rendered," says Joseph J. Grano, president of retail
sales and marketing at PaineWebber. "Where else are you going
to have your coupons clipped, and your dividends, quarterly
reports and statements sent out -- all for $50 a year? It's
the cheapest deal I ever heard of."
   But the commission increases and additional fees don't sit
well with investors. That's especially true at a time when
many individuals have been pulling in their horns, unloading
a net $104 billion of stocks they owned last year through
direct holdings in brokerage accounts.
   "There's hidden charges all over the place, and after a
while it makes you crazy," says David Traino, a 45-year-old
retired store owner. Mr. Traino protested a new charge for
tendering shares that was recently imposed by
Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. "What really
upset me was that the sheet I filled out for tendering the
shares said I would not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or
commissions."
   Janney Montgomery -- which has since softened its initial
policy of charging half the applicable commission on tenders,
and now charges a flat $40 fee instead -- says the move was
necessary because of the increasingly costly work involved in
such transactions. The firm also says that it has fewer fees
and lower commissions overall compared with its big Wall
Street rivals because, as a regional broker, its operating
costs are lower.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Traino, who has had an account at Janney
Montgomery for 20 years, is thinking of switching brokers. He
isn't alone.
   After one New York firm, which asks not to be identified,
imposed an inactive-account fee on a sizable fraction of its
client base, at least as many customers left as agreed to
pay. Of the customers subject to the levy, 25% got special
exemptions, 30% paid the fee, 30% left the firm and 15% were
spurred to do a trade or generate other revenue to avoid the
fee, a top executive says.
   Even some brokerage-industry executives don't like the
unbundled charges. "The people who are nickel and diming
their customers just because revenues are down are making a
big mistake," says Smith Barney's chief executive, Frank
Zarb.
   Like other big firms, Smith Barney imposes an
inactive-account fee and charges for postage and handling.
And it gets as much as $200 a year for its money-management
account. But Mr. Zarb says those charges are justified by the
level of service his firm's customers receive. "The notion
that you've got to jack up fees to cover costs is sometimes
valid -- but only if you're charging a fair return and
providing extra service or some other value-added," he says.
   Many brokers say they have little choice but look for ways
to bring in money. "Everyone's doing something now to enhance
revenues," says Charles Sheehan, chief financial officer at
Kidder Peabody. The reason is that "when volume is down, your
fixed costs are spread across fewer transactions -- so unit
costs come under a lot of pressure."
   Moreover, many Wall Street executives say, the drive to
make individual investors shoulder a greater share of the
costs goes beyond today's slow business climate. "To some
extent, the changes are evolutionary," says Mr. Sheehan.
"There's a growing feeling (on Wall Street) that we are
providing services for some customers who are not doing
anything to compensate the firm."
   Still, there is a bit of good news for some brokerage
customers. Prudential-Bache had considered boosting its $30
inactive-account fee, or "client service retainer," to a
hefty $175 a year. Now the firm says it will probably adopt
the $50 charge levied by most of its major competitors.
   Shearson -- which led the march toward higher customer
charges until early 1989 -- was alone among the major firms
in shunning new fees in the past year. Instead, the firm has
trimmed some services -- for instance, customer statements
that used to be sent out monthly are now going out only
quarterly.
