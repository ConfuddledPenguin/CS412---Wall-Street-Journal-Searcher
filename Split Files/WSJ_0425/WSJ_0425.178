   EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. said Thomas G. Wyman, a
recently elected company director, was named chairman,
succeeding William F. Farah, who will remain a board member.
   Mr. Wyman, 66 years old, formerly was chairman of L.G.
Balfour Inc. of Attleboro, Mass., and owns a 5% stake in
Farah, a clothing manufacturer.

   It wasn't clear immediately whether Mr. Wyman was named
over Mr. Farah's objections. Following Mr. Wyman's election,
Mr. Farah, 70, wrote letters to the company's board members,
urging them to either replace current management or resign.
Board members apparently have refused to follow that request.
Mr. Wyman said that Mr. Farah, who has a 17% stake in the
company, has been unhappy with the direction of the company.
   Mr. Wyman wouldn't elaborate, referring further questions
to Mr. Farah, who couldn't be reached for comment.
   Farah, which has been reporting declining sales and
losses, says it has been taking steps to improve its
inventories, deliveries and manufacturing process. In the
first quarter ended Jan. 26, the company reported a loss of
$589,000, narrower than its year-earlier first-quarter loss
of $1.4 million.
   Last year, the company discussed the sale of the company
and then agreed to sell its Generra sportswear unit to a
management-led group. In midyear, Mr. Farah resigned as
president and chief executive officer and was succeeded by
Richard C. Allender. Mr. Farah still has more than two years
remaining on a three-year consulting agreement that pays him
$365,000 a year and provides him with an office.
   Mr. Wyman said he plans to support Mr. Allender's current
strategy. "I think the company should follow the present
goals which have been in place for too short a period of
time," he said. "Mr. Allender is making every effort to
improve the company."
