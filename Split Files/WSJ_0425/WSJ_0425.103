   LOS ANGELES -- MGM Grand Air, the luxury airline unit of
MGM Grand Inc., said it plans to add three reconfigured DC8
Super 62 aircraft to its main New York-Los Angeles route in
August, replacing the 727-100s currently in use.
   The new aircraft will double MGM Grand's capacity on its
New York-Los Angeles route, Charles L. Demoney, the airline's
president and chief executive officer, said. Two of the
727-100s will be used for charter flights, and a third may be
put up for sale, he said.

   The luxury airline, which began service in September 1987,
said the DC-8s will be reconfigured from 190 seats to 81
seats each. The company will spend $55.5 million to buy and
refurbish the planes; that equals about $162,500 a seat. The
new planes' cargo capacity may enable the airline to boost
revenue 4% to 5% from cargo business, Mr. Demoney said.
   MGM Grand began turning a profit after five quarters of
operation, he said; it reported revenue of $30.2 million for
1989, a 36% increase from the prior year. The airline runs at
a load factor of about 75%, but Mr. Demoney said it may show
load factors in the high 50% range in the first months of the
larger planes' operation.
   The airline offers luxury transcontinental service at a
fare of $1,017 one way, roughly equal to other airlines'
first-class rate. Although the airline hopes to launch
international service to London, Tokyo and Paris, no such
move is likely anytime soon, the company said.
   MGM Grand, which is controlled by investor Kirk
Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp., also operates a Las Vegas casino
and plans to build another Las Vegas entertainment project.
