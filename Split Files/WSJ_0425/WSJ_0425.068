   Like many other small-business owners in Houston, Glenn M.
Crosby had to retrench in the wake of the Texas oil slump.
Having sold or closed three restaurants, he is left with only
one.
   But his Mr. C Sandwich Shop earns a profit, and is the
source of considerable pride. "I have survived, while a lot
of sighted people in the same business have not," says Mr.
Crosby, who is blind.

   Many blind people such as Mr. Crosby are becoming
entrepreneurs these days. Like other minorities before them,
they are finding that entrepreneurship can create
opportunities for people who otherwise might have found the
door shut.
   Of the estimated 180,000 working-age blind Americans, some
70% are unemployed or underemployed, says the National
Federation of the Blind, an advocacy group based in
Baltimore. Nobody knows exactly how many blind people are
running their own unsubsidized full-time or part-time
businesses. But Kenneth Jernigan, executive director of the
federation, estimates that the number has doubled during the
past decade, to at least 4,000. Many sighted people are more
inclined to believe in the abilities of the blind, he says,
and the blind also have more confidence in themselves.
   "It's harder to go into business if you can't get credit,
if nobody believes you can do it, and you don't really
believe it yourself," Mr. Jernigan says. But blind people
increasingly are finding the means to venture into the
private sector, he says. Others say there has been a logical
progression: After making gains in employment in the 1970s
and '80s, especially in the public sector, more of the blind
are ready to start their own businesses.
   Diane Starin of Orland, Calif., runs a business training
horses and giving riding lessons. "People have never
questioned how I go about doing it," says Ms. Starin, who has
been blind since infancy. She says she frequently asks
student riders questions like, "Are your heels down?" to
compensate for a lack of visual information.
   And in training young horses to move to a trot from a
walk, she sometimes ties bells to their legs, so she can hear
whether the gait changed precisely on command. (The bells are
unnecessary when Ms. Starin is actually riding the horse.)
   "After the first 15 minutes of being around Diane, I
forgot she was blind," says Joanne Van Meter, whose daughter,
Amy, then 11 years old, took riding lessons from Ms. Starin
for six months.
   Now Ms. Starin, who keeps three horses, is diversifying.
Having noticed that the Orland area has plenty of people
shearing sheep, she says she "just seized the opportunity"
and bought a machine to sharpen clipper blades for them.
"It's really wise for me to do this new thing," Ms. Starin
says. "Horse training is harder work for comparatively little
money."
   Growing numbers of blind people, such as Tallahassee,
Fla., lawyer S. Craig Kiser, are starting their own private
professional practices, too. Mr. Kiser, who had worked for
the state of Florida's controller, says he had no trouble
getting a $10,000 bank loan to set up his first private
practice, which was in Naples, Fla. "The banker said he
routinely took chances with young attorneys and wasn't going
to treat me any different," Mr. Kiser recalls.
   Though not all blind people have received such a fair
shake, more are venturing to seek loans. "The blind have come
to recognize their own abilities and right to independence,"
Mr. Kiser says. "That kind of self-confidence wasn't there as
little as 10 to 15 years ago."
   In working totally for themselves, the boldest blind
people are going a step further even than those in the
federally subsidized programs, often called enterprise
programs, that help many blind people earn a living through
newsstands, card shops and other retail businesses.
   But some owners of subsidized businesses also are
displaying more drive and entrepreneurship than in the past,
authorities on the blind say. Donald J. Morris enjoys a
rent-free lease for his O'Leary's Emporium, on federal
property near the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Md.
But the store, which pays a portion of pretax profit in lieu
of rent, is thriving mostly because Mr. Morris broadened its
scope. Instead of selling mostly food and personal-care
items, O'Leary's stresses sales of memorabilia for
firefighters.
   Mr. Morris became blind in 1967, when he was a
telephone-company salesman. "I was all set to live the life
of a blind person -- to get into a corner out of life's way,"
he says. But he persuaded himself to attempt more.
   As a store owner, he says, his success depends largely on
service. "People are greeted within 30 seconds of walking
in," he says. "Within a minute they're offered a cup of
coffee" -- made extra hot so that people will browse while it
cools. "None of these things involve eyesight," he says of
his formula for success. He says O'Leary's is profitable, on
annual sales of nearly $400,000.
   Blind business-owners say they may lose business because
some sighted people are uncomfortable around the blind or
doubt the blind can do their jobs. On the other hand, they
say, some sighted people want to help a blind person make a
living. In any case, dealing with the sighted can be
stressful. Mr. Morris, for one, says sighted salespeople for
suppliers sometimes tell him, "You're so good at this, I
don't think of you as being blind." He adds: "I'm sure they
intend it as a compliment, but it's really an offense."
   Some blind people say the hardest problems running a
business are psychological. "As a member of a minority group,
you tend to think you're not going to be able to do the job,"
says Peggy Pinder, a blind Yale graduate who has her own law
practice in Grinnell, Iowa, where she serves on the city
council. Having overcome her own doubts, Ms. Pinder says she
helps counsel others with similar feelings.
   Though she says she requires more secretarial help than
many other lawyers do, Ms. Pinder says there isn't any aspect
of her work that she can't handle. Her practice, she says, is
profitable and as big as she wants it. Moreover, it's her
own: "I can decide my own hours," she says. "I can set my own
rules."
   Not surprisingly, some blind entrepreneurs have made
businesses out of helping others who are blind. Charles E.
Hallenbeck, a blind University of Kansas psychology
professor, started up a sideline business, called Kansys Inc.
The business, housed in his garage in Lawrence, produces
computer software for the blind. Some of the software helps
computers simulate speech; some helps them generate Braille
documents.
   There have been setbacks, as when banks refused to lend
the company $15,000 to renovate the garage. "Banks have
regarded our business efforts as kind of a joke or a hobby,"
says Mr. Hallenbeck, who managed to get a $7,500 charitable
grant and a $7,500 personal bank loan. But Kansys had about
$25,000 in sales in 1989 and expects to be profitable by
1993, Mr. Hallenbeck says. "Our credibility is greatly
enhanced," he says, "because we're knowledgeable users of our
own products."
