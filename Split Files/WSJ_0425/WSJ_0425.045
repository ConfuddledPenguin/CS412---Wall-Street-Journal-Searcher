   CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said it plans to spin
off its real-estate and energy operations to shareholders by
year end, with a target for completion "sometime in the third
quarter."
   Yesterday's disclosure marks the first time the railroad,
natural-resources and real-estate concern has formally
declared it will spin off its energy operation, although such
a move has been widely expected.

   The news, announced at the company's annual meeting, also
represents a speedup in the timetable for divestiture of the
company's giant real-estate holdings.
   The planned spinoffs are contingent on the company's
refinancing of $780 million in payment-in-kind debentures
issued in a 1988 recapitalization; a spokesman said the
company doesn't expect "any major problems" in arranging the
refinancing. In addition, the transactions are subject to
receipt of regulators' rulings that they can be done on a
tax-free basis.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Santa Fe shares rose 5/8, to close at $21, on volume of about
821,000 shares.
   Santa Fe's continuing corporate makeover had until last
week been largely stalled by a lingering potential legal
problem: Under a court ruling in an antitrust case, the
company last year was ordered to pay a pipeline joint venture
$750 million. But last week it settled the case for $350
million, clearing the way for further progress in its
restructuring plans.
   In both its real-estate and energy holdings, Santa Fe's
strategy has been to sell minority stakes for cash to pay
down its recapitalization debt, while maintaining the bulk of
the "upside potential" for its shareholders. The company's
stock has for some time traded more on investors' perceptions
of its assets' value than on its operational earnings.
   In December, Santa Fe sold a 20% stake in its Santa Fe
Pacific Realty unit to a limited partnership made up of the
California Public Employees Retirement System and JMB Realty
Corp. The parent has since stressed that the $398 million it
received for that one-fifth stake represented a discounted
price, because the partnership brought needed cash and was an
early investor. The company says it values the realty
operation at $3 billion.
   Until yesterday, the deadline for completing the spinoff
of its remaining realty holdings had been the end of 1991.
The real-estate operation, based in San Francisco, has about
two million acres of developed and undeveloped land in 13
states, and its plans include -- if market conditions permit
-- construction of nearly 27 million square feet of buildings
over the next five years.
   In March, Santa Fe Pacific took its Houston-based Santa Fe
Energy Resources Inc. unit public, selling an 18.3% stake in
the exploration and production concern for $213 million. At
the end of 1989, the company said, the energy operation had
proved reserves of 251 million barrels of oil equivalent,
which includes natural-gas figures. Santa Fe Energy, which
went public at $18.25 a share, closed in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading yesterday at $16, up 1/8.
   After the spinoffs, Santa Fe will comprise the Santa Fe
Railway, with revenue last year of $2.2 billion; a mining
operation that the company has signaled may itself one day be
spun off; and a 44% stake in Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline
Partners, a publicly traded limited partnership. The mining
and pipeline holdings together contributed revenue of $159.8
million last year.
