   BORDEN Co. (New York) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.
lowered the ratings on Borden's long-term debt, citing the
likelihood that cash flow coverage of debt will be at lower
levels than Moody's previously expected for the intermediate
term. Ratings were lowered to single-A-1 from double-A-3 on
various categories of debt. Last fall the food company
announced a restructuring and established a $404 million
after-tax reserve for plant realignments and a shrinking of
its dairy business. Moody's said it believes that the actions
will improve the outlook for earnings and cash generation
ultimately, but in the meantime, "increased marketing
expenditures needed to support brands will consume a
substantial part of the restructuring gains." About $1.2
billion of debt is affected.
