   NEW YORK -- Max C. Chapman Jr., co-chairman of the U.S.
unit of Nomura Securities Co., will be nominated to the board
of the parent company in a vote Wednesday in Tokyo, according
to sources close to Nomura.
   Before joining the 40-member board of the world's largest
investment bank, Mr. Chapman must be approved at another
board meeting in mid-May and by shareholders at the annual
meeting June 29.

   If Mr. Chapman joins the board, as is expected, he will be
the first non-Japanese ever chosen to serve in that group.
The former president of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. joined the U.S.
unit Oct. 2, after being passed over for the chief
executive's job at the broker-dealer's holding company, a
unit of General Electric Co.
   P.J. Johnson, a Nomura spokesman in New York, said that
Mr. Chapman is one of several candidates for the board and
that election shouldn't be taken for granted. Nevertheless, a
ranking board member in Tokyo said that Mr. Chapman "clearly
deserves membership on the board, and his hiring indicates
our commitment to expanding Nomura's global presence."
