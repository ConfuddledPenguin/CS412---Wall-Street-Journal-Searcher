   Enserch Corp. said it will record a gain of $9 million, or
14 cents a share, on the public offering of the company's
discontinued oil-fields services unit.
   Enserch, a Dallas energy concern, said Pool Energy
Services completed its offering of 11.5 million common
shares, including one million from the underwriters
overallotment option, at $10.25 a share. Enserch bought an
additional two million shares in a private sale at the same
price. The company didn't specify when it would take the
gain.

   Enserch will distribute the two million Pool Energy shares
on a pro-rata basis to its shareholders as a special dividend
later this year. Enserch said net proceeds from the sale,
received in exchange for oil-field assets, are being used to
reduce certain obligations, primarily leases and commerical
paper.
   Separately, Enserch reported first-quarter net income rose
to $44.7 million, or 64 cents a share, from $35.8 million, or
55 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest period included
a $22 million gain from a stock sale. Revenue increased to
$771 million from a restated $752.1 million.
