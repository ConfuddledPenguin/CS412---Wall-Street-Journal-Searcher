   You say in the April 2 Washington Insight column that "the
U.S. administration has declined to recognize Lithuania's
declaration of independence, despite urgent requests from
Vilnius and a 40-year U.S. policy of refusing to recognize
the Soviet annexation of Lithuania and the other Baltic
republics."
   You should note, however, that the U.S. still extends
diplomatic recognition to the representatives of the old
independent republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. While
the White House may be hedging its bets on Lithuania,
officially it still considers the Soviet Baltic republics to
be illegally occupied territories that are entitled to full
independence.
