   LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Leslie Combs II always caused a stir.
His fondness for younger women was legendary. "A tough old
cat needs a tender young mouse," he told local reporters. His
mansion's sunroom windows were said to be made of bulletproof
glass.
   Now Mr. Combs lies under the fresh Kentucky bluegrass of
his grave -- still causing a stir. When he died at the age of
88 earlier this month, he left only furniture and jewelry to
his two children. The bulk of his estate, estimated at about
$13 million, went to the McDowell Cancer Foundation, a
fund-raising group for a cancer treatment center here.

   Sounds generous. But there is a big hitch.
   The foundation must first fire its director, 37-year-old
Linda Mauk. If she stays, the booty goes to Centre College, a
Danville, Ky., liberal-arts college where Mr. Combs spent two
years.
   That puts the cancer foundation, which may decide this
week whether to honor the old man's last wish, in a tight
spot. "It's a lot of money," says William Bagby, a tax
attorney and foundation president.
   Other foundation leaders and horse breeders are outraged.
They say they will drop their support for the center if Ms.
Mauk is fired. "How can they let some old nut run this from
the grave," steams Mary Jane Gallaher, a fellow Lexingtonian
who's known the Combs family for years.
   Says Marylou Whitney, fellow horse breeder and flamboyant
hostess of the Lexington and Saratoga party scenes: "No one
should be dismissed without cause." Mrs. Whitney is so
incensed that she has resigned as a fund-raiser for the
foundation. And she is taking her millions with her.
   Mr. Bagby, a former Treasury Department investigator,
hopes there is a loophole that will both satisfy the will and
allow Ms. Mauk to keep her job.
   The million-dollar question remains: Why did Mr. Combs
dislike Ms. Mauk?
   Everyone except Mr. Combs seems to think she has done a
good job. She has helped raise nearly $30 million to build
the Lucille Parker Markey Cancer Center. "It's a
fund-raiser's worst nightmare," says the petite and energetic
Ms. Mauk, who insists that she and Mr. Combs were once
friends.
   Other friends say they're not surprised that the willful
horse breeder wrote such a bizarre will. "Leslie had a mean
streak to him, especially after he got old and couldn't chase
girls anymore," says Mrs. Gallaher.
   The son of a farm manager, Mr. Combs rose from humble
beginnings to become a legend in the horse industry, helping
establish the first Keeneland horse sales during World War
II. He wooed potential horse buyers, such as Louis B. Mayer,
the movie mogul, at Bluegrass parties during horse auctions
and Kentucky Derbys.
   Mr. Combs and his Spendthrift Farm rose to stardom when he
and a group of investors bid $1.25 million in 1955 for
Nashua, sire of scores of stakes winners. The group was the
first million-dollar syndicate in racehorse breeding. Mr.
Combs gained further fame with Majestic Prince, winner of the
1969 Kentucky Derby.
   "He was a master," says Preston Madden, a breeder who as a
teen-ager learned to drink bourbon and play poker at
Spendthrift. "Leslie would always tell the butler to bring
out the good whiskey for me."
   Friends say Mr. Combs changed when Spendthrift hit hard
times. A public offering of the farm's stock turned sour when
the horse market weakened in the early 1980s. Angry
shareholders sued. Slowly the farm was sold off. A group of
private investors own the remaining real estate and horses.
   Virginia Anderson, a former reporter for the Lexington
Herald-Leader who chronicled Spendthrift's demise, says Mr.
Combs was a smart businessman, but he always wanted to do
more than talk business. "He thought he was Don Juan," she
says.
   Decorated in bright pinks and greens, the sunroom of his
house had some rather odd furnishings, visitors say. At first
glance, the silk flower arrangement in the center of a table
appeared normal, they note, but a closer inspection revealed
that the blossoms were actually tiny silk buttocks and
penises. "He had a lot of strange toys," says a confidante.
   Was Mr. Combs doing unto others as they had done unto him?
His wife, Dorothy Enslow Combs, died in 1968. Her will
bequeathed him not a dime of her real estate and railroad
fortune if he ever remarried. He never did. His wealthy
mother-in-law, Juliette Enslow, was strangled in 1936. (The
murder was never solved). She left her son-in-law a mere set
of books written by Honore de Balzac, who chronicled
money-grubbers and gold-diggers.
   Mr. Combs's will, read two weeks ago, has cast a cloud
over Bluegrass's most festive season. With the Derby a little
more than a week away, Mrs. Whitney and others are busy
planning Derby Eve parties, buying fancy gowns and preparing
for an onslaught of guests.
   But now the horse crowd is buzzing about the will. Most
expected Mr. Combs, who developed prostate cancer 11 years
ago, to leave his estate to the McDowell Foundation. Indeed,
that pledge persuaded the Markey Center several years ago to
name one of its research buildings after his wife.
   But Ms. Mauk says he changed his mind -- and last fall,
his will -- after she and his physician, Ben Roach,
discouraged him from going to Mexico for alternative cancer
treatments. Kay Timmons, Mr. Combs's companion and a believer
in holistic medicine, was angry that Ms. Mauk wouldn't
endorse the trip, according to friends. Ms. Timmons, who was
bequeathed $200,000 by Mr. Combs, couldn't be located for
comment.
   "He wasn't thinking clearly at that point," says Mrs.
Whitney. She visited Mr. Combs regularly during his final
stay at the cancer center in a room one floor above Ms.
Mauk's office.
   Mr. Combs's daughter, Juliette Trapp, contends that her
father changed his mind after Ms. Mauk threatened to take her
mother's name off the research building. "This was
understandably traumatic to him and was enough to cause him
to include the reference to Ms. Mauk in his will." Ms. Mauk
denies such a threat.
   Still another theory holds that Mr. Combs was trying to
get even with Ms. Mauk for rebuffing his advances. "It wasn't
like that at all," insists Ms. Mauk. Others say Mr. Combs was
trying to get back at both Ms. Mauk and Dr. Roach because he
didn't approve of their relationship. Dr. Roach, who has been
separated from his wife for seven years, is dating Ms. Mauk.
   Balderdash, say Dr. Roach and Ms. Mauk. Sure, they are
involved, but Mr. Combs never had a problem with that. "We go
to church and parties together," says Ms. Mauk. "We're an
accepted part of the community."
   Indeed, the couple often dined with Mr. Combs and Ms.
Timmons at the Coach House and other horsey hangouts. "He
invited us to spend a week with them in Florida," Ms. Mauk
says. "A year ago, he considered us his best friends."
   In death as in life, Mr. Combs has insisted on doing
things his way. In his will, he even outlines how his
children, Brownell Combs and Mrs. Trapp, should draw straws
if they disagree on how to divide up the china, silver and
other goodies. Brownell also got his father's membership in
Indian Creek Country Club in Florida. Friends say the two
children received plenty of money from their mother's estate
and Mr. Combs gave them money before he died.
   Mr. Combs's secretary, Bess Bell, received $50,000. Two
household servants got some cash. And grandson Leslie Combs
Trapp got $100,000 to pay for his daughter's education.
   The bulk of the estate is in two trusts, which will make
yearly payments to Centre College -- and to the cancer
foundation, if it abides by Mr. Combs's wishes. But the
foundation's trustees first must decide this: to give Ms.
Mauk the boot, or to forget the loot. Wayne Smith, president
of Central Bank &amp; Trust in Lexington and a trustee, says it's
quite a dilemma. "It's like someone saying they want to put
$100 million in Central Bank, but Smith has got to go," he
says.
   What would he do in that situation? "I'd probably take my
stock and run," he quips.
   An editorial in the Lexington Herald-Leader chastised the
foundation for even considering Mr. Combs's demand: "That
faint chuckling noise you hear is an old horseman enjoying a
last laugh at the expense of Mauk and the cancer foundation's
image," the editorial said. Letters to the editor suggest
that Centre College refuse the money. The school hasn't
decided what it will do.
   But once again, Mr. Combs could get the last laugh. His
will says if anyone takes legal action to upset his will, all
the money goes to the college.
