   Hoechst AG joined other major West German chemical
companies by boosting its annual cash dividend for 1989 to 13
Deutsche marks ($7.64) a share from the 12 marks a share paid
for the previous year.
   Earlier in the day, Bayer AG announced a similar dividend
boost to 13 marks a share, while the last of the big three
West German chemical groups, BASF AG, said last week it would
boost its regular cash payout by a mark to 13 marks and
distribute a special one-mark cash payout to holders to
celebrate the company's 125th anniversary.
