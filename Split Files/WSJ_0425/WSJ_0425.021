   NORTHBROOK, Ill. -- International Minerals &amp; Chemical
Corp. said it will ask shareholders at a special meeting June
14 to approve a change in the company's name to Imcera.
   The company said its current name "no longer describes
what we do. We've changed from a commodity chemical producer
to a builder of technology businesses in human and animal
health care and specialty chemicals."
