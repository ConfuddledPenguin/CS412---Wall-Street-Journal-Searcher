   NEW YORK -- For the second day in a row, interest rate
worries sank stock prices but left bonds about unchanged. The
dollar closed mixed against the major currencies.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.17 to 2654.50,
the average's fifth consecutive decline. Long-term Treasury
bonds, which zig-zagged higher and lower during the day,
closed nearly unchanged with the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond at 8.96%.

   A bigger-than-expected increase in durable goods orders in
March initially caused bonds to fall and stocks to rise. But
the reaction to the data subsided as analysts came to view
the orders gain as simply offsetting declines in January and
February.
   Bond yields will probably hit 9% before falling below
8.5%, analysts predict, and stock investors just can't get
those higher yields out of mind. Nothing seems like a "safe"
investment these days. For example, Compaq Computer, which
analysts expect to report slightly higher earnings tomorrow
saw nervous investors walk away from the stock yesterday,
pushing it down more than 3 at one point; it closed down 1
7/8 at 94 5/8.
   As a result of that kind of queasiness, declining issues
again stepped ahead of advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange by 833 to 652. "All trends are down; broader
averages are masking the declines in the broad market," said
Paul Lesutis, director of Provident Capital Management.
"There is no real evidence that stocks are bottoming."
   Mr. Lesutis and other investors think stocks are too
high-priced to compete with the yields on Treasury
securities. Indeed, small investors are finding Treasury bond
yields attractive, says Douglas McAllister, vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Last month,
Prudential-Bache's Treasury order desk for small investors
had the most business in its history, Mr. McAllister says,
and the pace hasn't slackened since. "Many small investors
are not content with consumer deposit" yields, Mr. McAllister
says.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks finished lower. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange totaled 137,360,000 shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bonds were unchanged. Prices on short-term Treasury notes
were down less than $1 for each $1,000 face amount.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar finished mixed. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.6980 marks and 158.93 yen compared
with 1.6995 marks and 157.60 yen late Monday.
