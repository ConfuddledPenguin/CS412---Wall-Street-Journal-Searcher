   LOS ANGELES -- William Dean Singleton said he will spin
off Houston Post Co. from his Consolidated Newspapers Inc. to
reduce a heavy burden of short-term debt.
   Unlike some media companies, such as Ingersoll
Publications Co., that are burdened with junk bond debt, Mr.
Singleton is restructuring about $95 million in short-term
bank debt into long-term debt with institutions. It was the
short-term debt that Mr. Singleton used in the 1980s to build
his closely held MediaNews Group, the newspaper company that
operates the Houston Post, Denver Post and dailies in
California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

   Mr. Singleton, who is here attending the annual meeting of
American Newspaper Publishers Association, said the Houston
Post will be spun off to shareholders, which include Mr.
Singleton and his longtime partner Richard B. Scudder,
chairman of MediaNews Group.
   "This is not a sign of distress," Mr. Singleton said of
the restructuring of the Houston Post. Since Mr. Singleton
bought the Houston Post two years ago, circulation has grown
40,000 and operating profit grew 31% last year, he said. "The
move reflects the change that what was acceptable debt in the
1980s won't be acceptable in the 1990s."
   Without the Houston Post, Consolidated Newspapers, which
will consist of the Gloucester County Times in Woodbury,
N.J., and Today's Sunbeam in Salem, N.J., will be merged with
Garden State Newspapers Inc. Garden State, which owns 15
dailies and 28 weekly newspapers, is 40%-owned by Media
General Inc. of Richmond, Va., and 30%-owned by both Messrs.
Singleton and Scudder.
   Essentially, the spinoff and merger leave Mr. Singleton
with a more manageable debt load, he said. When Consolidated
spins off the Houston Post, a "comfortable amount of debt,"
or about $55 million, will go with the Post. That debt has
been refinanced with institutions as long-term debt, Mr.
Singleton said. The remainder of the debt, about $40 million,
will stay with Consolidated Newspapers, which becomes part of
Garden State.
   Media General approved of the merger of the two New Jersey
papers into Garden State. Bob Pendergast, a spokesman, said,
"If there is any additional debt involved, it will not be
significant."
   While Mr. Singleton's properties are largely considered
healthy, his acquisition of the Houston Post had faced some
problems lately. The Toronto Sun Publishing Co. sold its
interest in Houston Post to MediaNews Group in 1987. But in
the Toronto Sun's annual report, it said Houston-based
MediaNews was in "technical default" on a $50 million note
held by Toronto Sun.
   Mr. Singleton said in an interview the default was a
result of having to wait for a tax ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service.
