   Most Americans have had it with coupons. With more than
265 billion of them distributed last year alone, it's no
wonder redemption rates among a coupon-weary population are
steadily sliding.
   That's why manufacturers are scrambling to find new
markets that aren't saturated with coupons, and they think
they've hit on a big one -- the U.S. Hispanic population.

   For years, most packaged-goods companies largely avoided
Hispanics, even though they account for as much as 10% of the
general population by some estimates. Hispanics didn't seem
to redeem as many as other population groups. Often, they
equated the coupons with food stamps as symbols of poverty.
   But recently, mass marketers have been learning how to
tailor coupons so that they're accepted in Spanish-speaking
barrios, where resistance has been greatest.
   Procter &amp; Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive are generally
considered pioneers, and are fast being joined by others,
including Philip Morris's Kraft General Foods and General
Mills.
   "The general market is saturated with coupons, and usage
is declining," says Sigfredo A. Hernandez, an assistant
professor of marketing at Ryder College, and co-author of a
study of Hispanic coupon usage. "That's why marketers should
pay attention to the Hispanic market. It's unsaturated -- and
it's up to marketers to take advantage of it."
   Certainly, the potential is there. In 1988, the average
U.S household received a staggering 2,500 coupons apiece. Yet
the average U.S. Hispanic household received just 20 coupons,
according to Kenneth Mitnick, president of Coupons Plus Inc.,
which distributes coupons to Spanish-speaking homes. Perhaps
the reason why Hispanic redemption rates are lower than
general rates, Mr. Mitnick suggests, is that "you cannot use
what you don't receive."
   Mass marketers, meanwhile, are faced with growing
disenchantment as they continue to throw billions of coupons
at the general market. Even as the total number of coupons
distributed nationwide has climbed steadily to 267.6 billion
last year, redemption has steadily dropped from more than 3%
to 2.7% in the past five years, according to Nielsen Clearing
House.
   While mass marketers readily agree that Hispanics are a
relatively untapped market, few have successfully tackled the
market, because so few have understood it. According to Mr.
Hernandez, 49% of Hispanics are partially assimilated into
U.S. culture, while 38% aren't assimilated at all. He says
neither group tends to read English-language Sunday
newspapers, where the vast majority of coupons are found.
   Some Hispanics aren't familiar with how to use coupons,
which aren't generally used in Latin America. That problem is
compounded by the fact that few marketers have printed
coupons in Spanish, the first language of many Hispanics. In
the Philadelphia barrio that Mr. Hernandez studied, many
corner bodegas didn't even accept coupons.
   Some savvier mass marketers are getting around those
problems by avoiding the print media, which is used to
distribute coupons to the general population. Instead, they
use direct mail, coupons in stores or even coupons delivered
door to door.
   Hispanic ad agency Font &amp; Vaamonde, for one, says it has
gotten redemption rates of 30% by delivering coupons door to
door, usually in combination with a promotion or sweepstakes.
It also hands out coupons in stores, often at the same time
as sampling or demonstration programs are going on in the
store. Among the agency's clients is Procter &amp; Gamble, for
which it handles Downy, Crisco and other brands.
   Mr. Mitnick's Coupons Plus, meanwhile, distributes
bilingual books of coupons by mail and in stores, and backs
up the booklets with advertising on Spanish-language
television. Among its clients is General Mills, which
advertises its cereals, Hamburger Helper and other brands. He
says that Hispanics have been "tremendously responsive" to
the promotions. The only reason they weren't more so in the
past, he contends, is because marketers didn't take the time
to try to reach them in Spanish and to explain how coupons
work.
   "The Hispanic consumer of 1990 is like the general market
consumer of the 1950s, when there wasn't the degree of
clutter there is today" he says. "They aren't jaded. They
appreciate advertisers who speak to them in their own
language. It shows a high level of respect for them, and they
respond by buying products directly advertised to them."

   Ayer Set to `Stretch' Itself
                                                                                                       

   At its annual shareholders meeting today, Ayer will
announce plans to launch an aggressive "brand strategy" for
the agency called "Stretch."
   Jerry J. Siano, Ayer chairman and chief executive officer,
said the strategy was developed as both an in-house measure
to challenge employees and as an effort to build the shop's
image on Madison Avenue. "These are goals to make us a much
more exciting, innovative organization," he said.
   As part of the "Stretch" plan, the agency developed a
symbol of an arrow pointing upward. It plans to put the arrow
on posters, new business literature and house ads that tout
the new strategy.

   MARLBORO BOYCOTT: The Washington, D.C., chapter of Act-Up,
a coalition of gay and lesbian activists that lobbies for
AIDS legislation, will launch a boycott of Marlboro
cigarettes on Thursday in a bid to unseat Sen. Jesse Helms
(R., N.C.). A spokesman for Act-Up said it chose Marlboro
because it is made by Philip Morris, a large corporate
contributor to Sen. Helms's political campaigns. Act-Up said
it's unhappy with Sen. Helms's voting record on issues
involving acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A Philip
Morris spokeswoman confirmed it contributes to Sen. Helms's
political action committees, but said it donates "three
times" as much money to AIDS research.
