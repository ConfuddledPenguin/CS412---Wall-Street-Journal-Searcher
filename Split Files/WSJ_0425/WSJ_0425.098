   MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- Allied-Signal Inc. said its
aircraft-engine joint venture with General Electric Co. will
produce engines for a new business jet built by Dassault, the
French airplane maker.
   Deliveries of engines, spare parts and service for the
plane are expected to generate $1 billion in revenue for the
50-50 joint venture over the life of the program, an
Allied-Signal spokesman said.

   Allied-Signal said the turbofan engine that will power the
plane is under development by the partnership, CFE Co.,
formed by Allied-Signal's Garrett Engine division and GE's
Aircraft Engines division.
   A Dassault spokesman said deliveries of the new
twin-engine eight-passenger plane, the Falcon 2000, will
begin in 1994. Dassault expects to sell "several hundred" of
the aircraft over the following 15 to 20 years.
   Allied-Signal also makes automotive and other aerospace
products and engineered materials. GE, Fairfield, Conn., has
interests in aerospace, defense and industrial products,
broadcasting and financial services.
