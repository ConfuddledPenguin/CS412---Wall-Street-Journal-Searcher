   TOKYO -- Imagine a stock market where investors ignore
basic fundamentals such as earnings and corporate growth
prospects. A market driven by floods of money. A market
trading at mind-boggling price levels.
   If that sounds like the Tokyo stock market of yore, think
again. For some investors in Japan, it's the Tokyo stock
market of today.

   Although a price collapse has dulled the speculative
luster of the once-mighty Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japanese
investors have been quietly transferring some of their old
buying habits to a new market: the over-the-counter market.
   Home to nearly 300 issues, the upstart market has managed
to turn in spectacular gains at a time when the world's
attention has been riveted on the main market's stunning
rout. The Nikkei average of 279 over-the-counter shares is up
52% since the start of the year; the Nikkei average of 225
large-capitalization stock-exchange issues is off nearly 27%.
The OTC market has dropped slightly this week, but investment
professionals expect it to continue attracting interest as
long as the main market is in the doldrums.
   Analysts ascribe the over-the-counter market's booming
success to several factors. Over-the-counter stocks were just
creeping into the spotlight when the Tokyo Stock Exchange
peaked at the end of last year. Nomura Securities Co., the
country's biggest firm, had just launched a $100 million OTC
fund in the U.S. Then, as the major market tumbled, investors
began looking for alternative places to invest.
   Compounding those elements, over-the-counter shares are
scarce. There are only about one-third as many
over-the-counter issues as there are first-section stocks on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. And the total capitalization of the
over-the-counter market is around 9 trillion yen ($57
billion), compared to the first-section's capitalization of
around 450 trillion yen.
   But, most important, prices were cheap. "There were a lot
of very undervalued stocks there," says Philip Whalley, an
institutional salesman at James Capel &amp; Co.
   No longer. Shoved higher by the weight of money coming
into the market, the average over-the-counter stock trades at
a price of more than 68 times earnings per share. That
compares with price-earnings ratios of less than 42 on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange and about 12 on Wall Street. Now
analysts argue that the over-the-counter market has assumed
many of the worst characteristics of the pre-crash Tokyo
market.
   "Regardless of price-earnings levels or growth rates, the
supply-demand situation is pushing up prices," says Yutaka
Nakai, a strategist for Daiwa Securities Co.
   Some stock-market mavens accuse the major Japanese houses
of intentionally pushing up prices on the over-the-counter
market to try to spark broader investor interest in the
sagging Tokyo market. They point to transactions in which
transaction records show one firm buying a large block of an
over-the-counter stock from another, related firm. But the
brokerage firms deny it. "The market is too small," says a
salesman at Nomura.
   Nonetheless, investors in the market aren't complaining
about their returns. Among over-the-counter stocks, some have
scored stupendous gains this year. And volume has been
soaring as interest in the market spreads.
   NMB Semiconductor Co., a chip maker, is one of the
priciest stocks in Japan at 5.7 million yen, nearly double
its price of around 3 million yen at the start of the year
and representing a price-earnings multiple of 55. Nikkodo
Co., a company that makes audio machines for recording and
amplifying singing, has shot up eightfold since it was listed
last September and now trades at a price-earnings ratio of
150.
   Tesco Co., a small wallpaper maker, is up 83% since the
start of the year and trades at a price-earnings ratio of 58.
   Perhaps the most extreme example of the over-the-counter
market's strength is Japan Associated Finance Co., a Nomura
affiliate that acted as a venture-capital backer for many of
the over-the-counter companies that are now soaring. Its
share price has risen by two-thirds since the start of the
year and its price-earnings multiple now stands at more than
300.
   "That shows how weird price movements in the OTC market
have become," says a foreign investment manager.
