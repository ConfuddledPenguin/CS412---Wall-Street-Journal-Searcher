   Hudson Foods Inc., Rogers, Ark., said net income for its
second quarter ended March 31 fell 47% to $2.1 million, or 15
cents a share, from $4 million, or 31 cents a share, a year
earlier, largely because of losses on turkey sales.
   Sales increased 2.7% to $146 million from $142.2 million.

   But Hudson's latest earnings represent a significant
improvement from its first-quarter results, largely because
of improvements in broiler prices.
   Other poultry producers, including Tyson Foods Inc. and
Pilgrim's Pride Corp., have posted sharply higher earnings
for the March 31 quarter, because profit margins on chickens
improved from a year earlier. But those companies aren't in
the turkey business, where retail prices haven't covered
costs of growing and processing the birds. Of Hudson's 740
million pounds of poultry production, about 100 million
pounds is from turkeys.
   Hudson's first-half profit fell 59% to $2.3 million, or 16
cents a share, from $5.6 million, or 43 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales increased 6.2% to $295.4 million from $278.2
million.
