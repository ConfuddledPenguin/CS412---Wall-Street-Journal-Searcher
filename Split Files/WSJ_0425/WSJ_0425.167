   MOORPARK, Calif. -- Tandon Corp., which hired Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. six months ago to explore financial
alternatives for the company, said it didn't renew its
contract with Bear, Stearns because the computer maker's
position has strengthened.
   Tandon's agreement with Bear Stearns, entered into last
September, expired on March 31. The decision not to renew,
the company said, was based primarily upon improved operating
results and a corresponding strengthened balance sheet,
following a company-wide organizational restructuring during
the past year.

   "While we anticipate continuing discussions with the
investment banking community, our position today is
significantly different than it was last September when we
engaged Bear Stearns to identify alternatives," the company
said.
   At that time, the company had lost $44.9 million in four
successive quarters and expressed concern about its liquidity
position.
   For the first quarter, the company had net income of $7
million, or 11 cents a share, against a loss of $9.9 million,
or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased about
13% to $105.1 million from $92.7 million.
   Tandon said its working capital increased by $23.8 million
from June 30, 1989, to March 31, 1990, while at the same time
the company reduced its inventories to $94.4 million, from
$120.5 million. During the same nine-month period, the
company said its combined accounts and notes payable were
reduced to $45.6 million, from $75.8 million, and that its
cash position increased to $32.1 million, from $9.7 million.
