   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Appropriations Committee narrowly
approved $720 million in new assistance for Panama and
Nicaragua as part of a spending bill that would add an
estimated $2.5 billion to domestic accounts in the fiscal
year ending Sept. 30.
   By a 15-14 margin, the Bush administration blocked efforts
by committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) to cut Panama's
portion of the funding by $120 million. But the fight was a
harbinger of the increased difficulties the White House faces
in meeting demands for assistance to emerging democracies in
Central America and Europe.

   Allies of the administration were put in the awkward
position of rejecting an alternative package that included
$10 million to help the new Chilean government address
health-care problems and $150 million in Export-Import Bank
loan funds for U.S. businesses seeking trade with Eastern
Europe.
   Though important symbolically after the U.S. invasion last
December, the Panamanian funds include money for such items
as tourism and repayment on loans to multilateral banks.
Republicans were forced to swallow these costs by agreeing to
deeper cuts from defense than previously proposed by
Democrats.
   Though the Central America package was the heart of the
administration's initial request, the underlying bill, which
passed easily, has grown to include a laundry list of
domestic appropriations offset largely by reductions from the
Pentagon.
   Commerce Department funding would be increased by $125
million, including $110 million for the census now under way.
A total of $190 million is added for the Justice Department,
largely to meet increased salaries at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
   Food-stamp appropriations would be increased by $705
million, or 38% more than the House-passed version of the
same bill. The Senate committee also provides $94 million, or
almost double the House level, for veterans' medical care and
would fully fund the Head Start program for low-income
pre-school children with an additional $165.7 million.
   Reductions or transfers from defense accounts are expected
to exceed $2.8 billion, or over $1 billion more than the
House. While protecting politically favored projects, such as
the RDX munitions plant in Louisiana, the bill rescinds $171
million from the SR-71 reconnaissance program and assumes the
termination of research and development of a successor to the
Lance short-range nuclear missile in Europe.
   "This proposal reflects changes in requirements in view of
promising developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe," the committee report reads. "The likely
reunification of Germany makes ultimate deployment" of a new
generation of missiles "a virtual impossibility, according to
leading West German officials."
   The optimism here contrasted with the maneuvering by
Chairman Byrd elsewhere to seemingly goad Moscow and the
administration on Lithuania. The West Virginian produced a
hastily drafted amendment setting aside $10 million for a
U.S. embassy to the newly proclaimed republic of Lithuania,
but was forced to concede that he hadn't read the text
himself when challenged by Republicans. A more revised, and
more subdued, version was subsequently produced by anxious
staff as part of the final bill, but the language puts the
Senate in the position of appropriating funds for an embassy
without an ambassador yet appointed.
   Not included in the foreign aid totals is $400 million in
housing-loan guarantees to assist the resettlement of Soviet
Jewish refugees in Israel. The same credits are included in
the House-passed bill, but the Senate committee goes further
by spelling out the reduced fees that will be charged the
Jerusalem government for administration of the program.
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.), who has
questioned the cost and merit of the loan-guarantee program,
has indicated he won't oppose the measure on the floor.
   However, a separate fight may yet develop over a proposed
repeal of language that restricts the District of Columbia's
ability to use its funds to finance abortions.
Abortion-rights advocates were forced to back down after
President Bush repeatedly vetoed a similar provision last
fall, but the supplemental-spending bill gives the
abortion-rights movement a higher-profile vehicle and one the
administration will be harder pressed to reject outright.
