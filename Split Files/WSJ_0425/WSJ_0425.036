   FRANKFURT -- The deficit in the West German service
balance is likely to shrink in the coming years, slowing down
the expected reduction in the country's current account
surplus, the Deutsche Bundesbank said in its April monthly
report.
   The service balance consists of income and expenses from
capital flow, tourism, and other payments.
