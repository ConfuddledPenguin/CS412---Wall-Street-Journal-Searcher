   CMS Energy Corp. said it has agreed to inject an
additional $17 million into four projects owned by its
partnership with Oxford Energy Co., which builds power plants
that burn waste tires.
   In return for its investment, CMS will receive 40% of
Oxford Energy's interest in the four energy projects. One of
the plants is completed, another is under construction, while
two others have not yet begun construction. CMS will make its
contribution over about 20 months.

   CMS already owns 49% of Oxford's stock. A CMS spokesman
said the investment will not affect the level of CMS's Oxford
stock holdings.
   CMS, based in Dearborn, Mich., also said it will provide
as much as $7.5 million as an equity contribution to one of
the tires-to-energy projects in 1991, when that project is
scheduled to be completed. Oxford stock closed at $4.25 a
share, unchanged, in American Stock Exchange composite
trading. CMS stock closed yesterday at $29, down 12.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
