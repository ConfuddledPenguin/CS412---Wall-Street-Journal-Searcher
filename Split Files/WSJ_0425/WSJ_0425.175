   Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks and
brokerage firms rose across the board -- pushing past the 9%
level for a five-year CD at one major bank.
   The increases in the week ended yesterday coincided with a
sharp rise in market interest rates that has pushed yields on
longer-term Treasury securities up to nearly 9%.

   The biggest increases in CD yields were among
small-denomination CDs sold by leading brokerage firms. The
average yield on one-year broker-sold CDs rose to 8.50% from
8.19%, while the five-year-CD average rose to 8.85% from
8.57%, according to figures compiled by Banxquote Money
Markets, a New York information service.
   Average yields for most large-denomination CDs, which
typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were also up
significantly. The greatest gains were in the longer-term
maturities. Average yields on two-year jumbo CDs were 8.43%,
while five-year maturities were 8.54%. In New York, Chase
Manhattan Bank raised the yield on its five-year CD to 9.17%,
one of the highest in the country.
   "Nine percent is a psychological resistance level," said
Banxquote Chairman Norberto Mehl. "Once one of the leading
banks has crossed this level, other banks are expected to
follow."
   Mr. Mehl said that some of the leading brokers, such as
Shearson Lehman Hutton and Dean Witter Reynolds, are also
offering CDs that are approaching the 9% level.
   Meanwhile, average yields on small-denomination CDs at 18
banks surveyed by Banxquote rose only slightly. The average
yield on a one-year consumer CD rose to 8.02% from 7.96%,
while five-year consumer CDs offered 8.20%, up from 8.16%.
