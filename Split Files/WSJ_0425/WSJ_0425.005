   On Monday, two Third World leaders made speeches at the UN
that would have seemed unthinkable in the recent past.
Bolivia's planning minister, Enrique Garcia, argued for a
move from "societies that overemphasize centralism and state
paternalism to those where individual initiative becomes the
driving force." Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Budimir
Loncar, dismissed Third World demands for a New International
Economic Order.
   The multiple failures of Marxism-Leninism are filling
everyone with euphoria about the advance of freedom and
democracy these days. But the tightened belts of the Third
World countries are turning into nooses that threaten to
strangle all but the most repressive governments. It will
take a resurgence of growth to save the situation. And growth
requires an inflow of capital, not merely debt reduction.

   Fortunately, this scenario points to a well-balanced
solution. Begin with the fact that the industrialized nations
face static horizons and a darkening unemployment picture
unless entirely new markets are found. The tendency of the
free enterprise system to produce up to and often beyond the
limits of effective demand cannot be corrected by perpetually
calling on the sated economies to boost their growth rates by
another 0.5%.
   On the Third World side, there are rapidly growing
populations that will turn into engines of violence and
instability unless they become gainfully employed using the
capital, technological know-how and management of the West.
   But wasn't that the great experiment and the great failure
of two decades ago? Not really, because the earlier
investments in and loans to the Third World were done
half-heartedly or imprudently by all parties. Third World
countries foolishly confused independence with surliness in
those days. They thought the world owed them everything for
its earlier misdeeds; and they saw each business overture as
a warning of neo-colonialism.
   The advanced countries were so caught up in their guilt
complexes that they dared not tell Third World countries of
their glaring management errors. So the corrective advice
that every business partner gets from his investors was
denied to the new leaders who needed it most.
   Those mental lapses are evaporating. No longer fearful of
being dominated, Third World countries are recognizing that
equity participants are a far better source of capital and
growth than lenders who want their payments promptly and
often. And they have learned in a remarkably short time that
investors expect hospitality and equal treatment from a host
country.
   The spectacular successes of such Third World countries as
Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea have quieted fears that
emerging nations could never make good use of capital. Costa
Rica, Colombia, Chile, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, the
Philippines, Indonesia and at least a dozen other Third World
countries could very well surge into similar growth patterns.
   What is needed is an invitation to the most promising
Third World countries to join in a partnership for growth.
The 24 advanced countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, working together to launch the
necessary infrastructure projects, could -- with trifling
sums of capital from each one -- start a move in the
high-growth direction. This is the program that HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp, former U.S. Agriculture Secretary John Block,
Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans and 13 other developed
country political leaders and experts have recently proposed
in Charles Cerami's "An International Roundtable on World
Economic Development," (Praeger, 1990). The selected
developing nations would accept stringent responsibilities --
hospitality to investors, free trade and an acceptance of
outside advice in deciding the projects to be undertaken.
   North-South partnership must come. When it does, let us
hope that there is no minimalism about it. For, as Israeli
diplomat Abba Eban has said, "The world's leaders are too
often occupied in marking time so vigorously that they give
the illusion of moving forward." Small moves would be utterly
wasteful in this area. Governments must show enough vitality
and consistency to tell private business that this time is
for real.
