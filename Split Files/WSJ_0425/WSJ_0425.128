   WASHINGTON -- The Interior Department, fighting for
congressional support for new offshore oil drilling, is
promising to pay more attention to environmental
considerations in offering leases.
   The department said it wants to allow drilling only in
areas where doing so wouldn't harm marine life and where
there is a good chance of finding oil. The policy would mark
a departure from the Reagan administration's approach of
making vast offshore areas available, only to have Congress
deny money to carry out the leasing program in many of them.

   The proposal is to be included in a new five-year plan for
the Outer Continental Shelf that would take effect when the
current plan expires in 1992. A draft plan is expected to be
available for public comment in the next couple of months.
   President Bush is expected soon to announce a long-awaited
decision on whether he will allow certain lease sales to
proceed off Florida and California. An Interior Department
spokesman said the agency would incorporate the president's
decision and other guidance from the White House into its
draft plan.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan is also considering
proposing that local governments be allowed to share in the
revenue from oil lease sales. Currently, some revenue is
shared with the states. A report on the Interior Department's
proposals appeared in yesterday's New York Times.
