   WASHINGTON -- President Bush said that for now he won't
impose sanctions against the Soviet Union for its crackdown
on Lithuania, a decision reflecting both his continued hopes
for negotiations and allies' unwillingness to support
sanctions.
   After days of debate within the administration about
whether to cancel talks with the Soviets on economic issues,
Mr. Bush said he still wants to avoid steps that might
provoke a Kremlin backlash and scuttle chances for a
negotiated end to the Lithuanian standoff. Mr. Bush noted
that a Lithuanian delegation is visiting Moscow, and he said
he didn't want to do anything that might reduce its chances
of persuading the Kremlin to open talks.

   He also indicated his worry that imposing sanctions now
might imperil progress already made in pulling Eastern Europe
out of the Soviet grip. "I'm concerned that we not
inadvertently do something that compels the Soviet Union to
take action that would set back the whole case of freedom
around the world," Mr. Bush told reporters.
   The president's decision means negotiations with the
Soviets in Paris on a broad new trade treaty, as well as
talks on a civil aviation agreement, will proceed as
scheduled this week, the White House said.
   Though the overriding reason for Mr. Bush's decision
appears to be his fear of undermining negotiations over
Lithuania, a widespread distaste for sanctions among U.S.
allies was a factor as well. Mr. Bush himself has been hoping
all along to avoid imposing sanctions for fear that might
spoil the climate for closing big arms-reduction deals with
the Soviets. European allies apparently have reinforced that
feeling by voicing similar concerns in consultations with the
White House over the last few days.
   "Our allies aren't prepared to join in on any sanctions,
and under those circumstances I am not sure that I would
recommend unilateral sanctions," said Rep. Dante Fascell (D.,
Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, after
a meeting with Mr. Bush yesterday.
   Some allies are worried that the problems facing Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev at the moment are so acute that
U.S. sanctions might be a serious blow to his regime, a
senior administration aide said. U.S. analysts don't think
Mr. Gorbachev is in such dire straits, the official said, but
agree that sanctions might have an especially substantial
impact on him right now.
   Mr. Bush and his aides insist that the administration
could reverse its position at any time and choose to impose
sanctions. In particular, the senior official said, they
would reconsider sanctions if the Kremlin continues to refuse
to open negotiations or further tightens an economic blockade
under which the Soviets already have cut oil, gas and other
supplies to Lithuania.
   Mr. Bush's inclination to avoid acting immediately was
reinforced by a meeting he held yesterday with a delegation
of leading congressional Democrats and Republicans, officials
said. Though some congressional conservatives have been
complaining about Mr. Bush's failure to lash out at the
Soviet Union, both administration aides and lawmakers said
after the meeting that the lawmakers offered general support
for Mr. Bush's cautious approach.
   Rep. Fascell, for instance, repeated a suggestion he's
made before that Mr. Bush cancel a summit meeting schedule
with Mr. Gorbachev for May 30 to June 4. And Sen. Jesse Helms
(R., N.C.) urged Mr. Bush to send a U.S. ambassador to
Lithuania in recognition of the breakaway republic's
declaration of independence.
   Overall, though, there was a "general feeling of support"
for Mr. Bush, said Sen. Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Still, some signs of brewing unrest in Congress are
emerging. Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), chairman of the
powerful Appropriations Committee, declared Sunday in a
Senate speech that he opposes "extending any new economic
benefits to the Soviets so long as they continue to frustrate
the legitimate status of Lithuania as an independent nation."
   In addition to the talks on trade and civil aviation
agreements, the U.S. also has pledged to support observer
status for the Soviet Union at the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the West's primary trade-regulation body.
Officials said withdrawing that support also could be a
possible sanction.
