   Yo] A book about the power of the financial press. This
must be a book that asks the big questions: why certain ideas
find a home with the mainstream press and others, equally
worthy, do not; how the press pushes and massages economic
ideas into political agendas; why dogmas go out of fashion.
This must be a book that asks -- and answers -- the question
of just how powerful the press is in determining everyday
economic life. In short, this must be one mighty interesting
book. Wrong.
   "The Power of the Financial Press" (Rutgers University
Press, 266 pages, $24.95), by Wayne Parsons, focuses instead
on a few economists and a few publications, asking, but not
always answering, why they did what they did. Though the
personalities are interesting, Mr. Parsons has not found an
engaging way to present them. And the publications might be
interesting, but again, those telling details that make for a
good yarn are absent.

   Mr. Parsons's hypothesis is a slippery thing to get hold
of. A reasonable guess is he's out to prove that economic
ideas can't have much influence beyond the influence they
exert in the imagination of the press. And that the easiest
way to exert influence is to get down and dirty and be an
economist-journalist-propagandist. But at the same time, he
seems to argue that such power-mongering is fading, because
of the growth of electronic networks and data bases.
   "The Power of the Financial Press" offers too much of some
things and not enough of others. For starters, there's much
too much history, and for another there's way too much on
Britain. Whatever parallels exist between Britain and the
U.S. to warrant such attention, they eluded Mr. Parsons.
   Too much is written about John Maynard Keynes. Well, too
much of the same thing, anyhow. Over and over again we are
told that Keynes set out to influence the times and thus the
press. Perhaps those who know nothing of Keynes will be
astonished at this piece of insight or a description of his
tactics -- he wrote often and broadly -- but those who have
been awake and breathing for the past several decades will be
bored by the endless reminders.
   Too much is written about John Kenneth Galbraith. Mr.
Galbraith is one of a handful of economist-personalities
highlighted by Mr. Parsons. But Mr. Galbraith, whose work is
unoriginal and decidedly unrigorous (polite phrase for
sloppy), hardly deserves the same billing as Keynes, Paul
Samuelson and Milton Friedman.
   At the same time, Mr. Parsons takes too little notice of
contradictions in his own thesis. For example, supply-side
economics didn't succeed because it captured the press. With
the exception of this paper's editorial page, the press first
ignored, then ridiculed, supply-siders. Supply-side economics
succeeded because it captured the enthusiasm of the
president. And the president succeeded because his ideas were
shared by most Americans. Indeed, the interesting thing is
how little power the press had to stop supply-side economics;
Mr. Parsons ignores this rough spot.
   Too little attention is given to other major personalities
who shaped the economic debate. Surely a book about the power
of the financial press ought to have had more to say on
columnist Leonard Silk, who defined American economics
reporting in Business Week and the New York Times. Ditto for
"academic scribblers" such as Martin Feldstein and Herbert
Stein.
   There also is too little about what was going on in the
economy. The interaction between the personalities and the
publications takes place center stage while the conditions
that encouraged or discouraged fashions in economic thought
are added, here and there, as an afterthought.
   Too little time is spent, for example, describing just
what was going on in the U.S. after a decade or two of
Keynesianism. Thus, the uninitiated might wonder why that
house of cards collapsed so swiftly and why the weary world
built another one out of the monetarist deck.
   Keynesianism took hold not because Keynes was an
indefatigable propagandist but because conditions were ripe
for a spell of big government. The economy was a disaster and
the country was willing to believe -- after two World Wars --
that in times of dramatic stress, the government could
organize and direct the economy.
   Monetarism took hold not because Milton Friedman was a
formidable propagandist, but because big government -- big
spending created another disaster: stagflation. And
supply-side economics caught on not because Arthur Laffer was
a clever propagandist but because the U.S. economy was bent
under high marginal tax rates, stagflation and
overregulation.
   Finally, there is too little of the last chapter. Here,
Mr. Parsons suddenly comes to life and offers a sweeping look
at the revolution in financial communications and the
commoditization of information. He laments the passing of the
era of economic gurus and worries that the press might not be
up to making sense of the current info glut. And although he
may have misplaced his emotions, this chapter is interesting.
