   ADAC LABORATORIES said it suspended its quarterly common
stock dividend because of a slowdown in orders from
customers. The Milpitas, Calif., medical imaging equipment
company last paid a four cent dividend in its fiscal second
quarter ended April 1. A spokesman for the company said Adac
has been affected by slower orders from hospitals, which the
company said are "taking a harder look at their capital
budgets." In addition, the company said it has been hurt by
increased competition. For the second quarter, the company
had net income of $1.2 million, or three cents a share, down
nearly 71% from the $4.1 million, or nine cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue declined nearly 17% to $20 million from
$24 million.
