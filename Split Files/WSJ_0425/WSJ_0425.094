   INSIDER TRADING IN JAPAN

   Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Office is investigating the
former president of a financial firm for alleged insider
stock trading, Japanese press reports said, in what would be
the first case handled under stronger regulations for the
offense.
   The case surfaced last June, when the stock of Nisshin
Kisen Kaisha surged in heavy trading on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in the days ahead of the company's official
announcement it would allocate new shares to third parties.
   The financial firm's former president, who wasn't
identified in the press reports, is believed to have obtained
information about the allocation before the announcement and
to have purchased 7,000 shares of Nisshin Kisen using the
name and bank account of an acquaintance, the reports said.
His company was one that received shares under the plan.
   If the case were filed with the Tokyo prosecutor's office,
it would be the first to be prosecuted under the stiffened
provisions of the Securities and Exchange Law enacted in
January 1989. The new regulations make insider trading a
criminal rather than a civil offense.
                                                                                                       

   A CHANGE FOR TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan has approved direct investment in the Soviet Union
and Albania, the government Board of Foreign Trade reported.
The cabinet decided to allow Taiwan citizens to set up
factories and offices in both communist nations and to open
banking and transportation links, said Lin Jui-long, a deputy
section chief at the board. Last month, the Nationalist
government lifted a ban on direct trade with the Soviet Union
and Albania in response to calls from local businessmen.
                                                                                                       

   HARD TIMES IN SWEDEN
                                                                                                       

   Swedish business insolvencies in the first three months of
1990 rose a record 39%, to 2,091 from 1,500 in the
corresponding period a year earlier, Statistics Sweden said.
The national statistics agency said insolvencies rose 78% in
the engineering sector and 89% in the real-estate-management
sector. But the total number of insolvency-related job losses
fell to 2,873 from 2,970 in the same period of 1989, as small
companies were hardest hit, the agency said.
                                                                                                       

   PRIVATIZING THAILAND'S AIRLINES
                                                                                                       

   A plan to partially privatize state-owned Thai Airways
International was approved by the Thai cabinet. The Ministry
of Transport and Communication will study three approaches,
according to a government spokesman. One entails listing
shares on the Securities Exchange of Thailand. A second
involves divestiture of some airline assets to private
investors through jointventure companies in which Thai
International would retain a 49% share. The third involves
raising funds through long-term overseas borrowings.
                                                                                                       

   NEEDY SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITAL
                                                                                                       

   South Africa's Groote Schuur Hospital, which pioneered
heart transplants, threw away a good human heart last week
because it lacked money and equipment to do anything with it,
said one of its surgeons, John Odell. "We could have used it.
We had a recipient in mind . . . but we didn't have the
equipment," Dr. Odell said. He said the hospital's heart unit
needs a new $80,000 heart-lung machine, monitors and other
equipment.
                                                                                                       

   OGILVY'S LONDON MOVE
                                                                                                       

   London's sprawling Docklands project has lured advertising
giant Ogilvy &amp; Mather, an agency in the WPP Group, as a
tenant in a much-needed boost. Ogilvy said it plans to move
its offices, with a staff of about 450, from Central London
to the Docklands' Canary Wharf office complex in early 1992.
Docklands, begun in the 1980s amid expectations that London
would become the main business center for all Europe, has
been bedeviled by Britain's current economic problems and
other factors, including what many view as a hard-to-get-to
location.
                                                                                                       

   U.S.-MADE HONDAS FOR EUROPEANS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Honda Motor Co. will produce Accord station wagons
in the U.S. for export to West Germany and other European
Community nations, a Honda spokesman said. The company plans
to begin production this fall at its assembly plant in
Marysville, Ohio.
   Full-scale shipment of the model to West Germany is
expected to start in 1991. Sample shipments will begin in
1990. The company expects to export 3,000 to 4,000 of the
station wagons to Europe annually but didn't specify how many
units will be allocated for West Germany.
   Honda is studying markets in the 12 EC nations, with a
focus on those with relatively moderate barriers to car
imports, the spokesman said. Italy and France are pushing for
EC-wide quotas to restrict sales of Japanese cars regardless
of where the vehicles are built.
   Honda's U.S. production is expected to reach 510,000 units
in calendar 1991, up from the 425,000 units forecast for
1990, the spokesman said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   By a margin of more than 3-1, residents of East Germany's
Karl Marx-Stadt voted to restore the city's pre-1953 name,
Chemnitz, the East German news agency ADN said. . . . New
Zealand's one- and two-cent coins won't be legal tender after
April 30 and are being melted for scrap metal. The small
copper coins "have lost their purchasing power over the
years," said a Reserve Bank official. One New Zealand cent is
worth a little more than half a U.S. cent.
