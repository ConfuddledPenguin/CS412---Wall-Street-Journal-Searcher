   Schering-Plough Corp. directors declared a 2-for-1 stock
split and lifted the quarterly dividend 24%, while Warner
Lambert Co. holders approved an increase in authorized shares
to effect a previously announced 2-for-1 split.
   At Schering, the moves reflect "several consecutive years
of outstanding earnings growth and good business
performance," said Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Madison, N.J., pharmaceuticals
concern.

   The split is payable May 30 to stock of record May 4. The
dividend increase, to 56 cents a share from 45 cents, is
payable May 21 to stock of record May 4. At March 31,
Schering had 113.3 million shares outstanding.
   Shareholders at Schering's annual meeting also rejected
two shareholder proposals: that the company stop doing
business in South Africa, and that it report annually to
holders on the scope of its use of animals in testing
products and on its efforts to stop using animals for
testing.
   Warner-Lambert reiterated a projection that earnings per
share will rise at least 16% in 1990, adjusted for the split.
In 1989, Warner-Lambert earned $6.10 a share.
   Shareholders at the annual meeting of the Morris Plains,
N.J., health-care and consumer products company approved a
doubling of authorized common, to 300 million shares.
Warner-Lambert will pay the split on or about May 16 to stock
of record May 2. Warner-Lambert has about 67 million shares
outstanding.
   Warner-Lambert holders also defeated shareholder proposals
that the company quit operating in South Africa and implement
cumulative voting for directors. Under cumulative voting,
each shareholder has a number of votes equal to the number of
shares he or she owns times the number of directors up for
election. A shareholder may allot the votes among the
director candidates in any way he or she wishes.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Schering shares rose 25 cents to $80.125, while
Warner-Lambert's fell $1 to $105.75.
