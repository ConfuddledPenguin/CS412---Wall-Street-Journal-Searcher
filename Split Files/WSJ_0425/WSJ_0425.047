   HOUSTON -- Five major oil companies reported mixed
earnings for the first quarter, with results skewed by
one-time items and higher crude prices.
   An increase in oil prices of $3 to $4 a barrel strongly
boosted exploration and production profits for all five
companies. Higher natural gas prices early in the quarter
also contributed to earnings gains.

   Petrochemical profits were down, often sharply, largely
because crude is the main feedstock in chemical processing.
And for the same reason, gasoline refining and marketing
results were generally flat to lower.
   Mobil Corp. reported a 7% drop in net income, while
Chevron Corp.'s profit surged 51%. Texaco Inc. net plunged,
but excluding a year-earlier restructuring gain the company
posted a strong increase. Shell Oil Co., the U.S. subsidiary
of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said profit sank 44%, though the
decline was less steep excluding a year-earlier gain.
Phillips Petroleum Co. said net climbed 36%, but without
one-time items profit would have dropped sharply.
   Mobil, based in New York, said net income fell to $400
million, or 94 cents a share, from $429 million, or $1.04 a
share. Revenue rose 6.3% to $14.91 billion from $14.02
billion.
   The company said crude oil prices were 25% higher than the
1989 first quarter and natural gas prices were 8% stronger.
As a result, Mobil's exploration and production profit soared
28% to $369 million.
   Chemical earnings plunged to $83 million from $180
million. Aside from higher crude prices, results were also
hurt by weaker chemical prices, which have been sliding since
the 1989 first quarter, Mobil said. The company said,
however, that some chemical prices are starting to firm.
   Chevron posted the strongest quarterly gain and far
exceeded analysts' expectations. The San Francisco company
said net jumped to $473 million, or $1.33 a share, from $313
million, or 91 cents a share. Revenue rose 21% to $9.3
billion from $7.7 billion.
   Like other companies' exploration and production
operations, Chevron's benefited from the higher crude and
natural gas prices. But the company also sold 13% more
natural gas than a year earlier to meet demand from the cold
spell early in the winter.
   Unlike the other major companies reporting yesterday,
Chevron's U.S. gasoline refining and marketing business
posted an earnings increase, to $59 million from $7 million.
And its chemical profit fell just 6%, well below most of its
competitors.
   Texaco said net fell to $328 million, or $1.15 a share,
from the year-earlier $1.46 billion, or $5.91 a share, which
included a gain of $1.19 billion primarily from the sale of
Texaco Canada Inc. Revenue fell 4.7% to $9.16 billion from
$9.61 billion.
   The White Plains, N.Y., company said exploration and
production profit rose 59% to $317 million, reflecting higher
crude and natural gas prices. But Texaco said prices have
weakened substantially this quarter. The company's overall
refining and marketing results were flat at $136 million,
while chemical earnings plunged to $16 million from $96
million.
   Texaco said it boosted its capital spending in the quarter
65% to $592 million, part of a large projected increase for
the full year, the company said.
   Shell, the Houston-based subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group, said net decreased to $203 million from $362 million,
which included a $70 million gain from an insurance
settlement. Exploration and production earnings rose 75% to
$173 million while chemical earnings decreased 56% to $98
million.
   The company, which reports its results before its parent
companies, had a $21 million loss from its gasoline refining
and marketing operations compared with profit of $113
million. Shell said higher crude prices reduced its gasoline
margins and freeze-related damage to its refineries hurt
profitability early in the quarter.
   Phillips, Bartlesville, Okla., said net rose to $259
million, or $1.06 a share, from $190 million, or 78 cents a
share. Revenue rose slightly to $3.13 billion from $3.1
billion. Without special items, the latest quarter's earnings
would have been $111 million.
   In the quarter, Phillips had gains totaling $238 million
from an accounting change and a settlement with Iran. It had
a $90 million loss from the sale of an insurance company.
   Phillips also said its earnings include $49 million for
business-interruption insurance related to lost earnings from
the explosion at its Pasadena, Texas, chemical complex.
Phillips's exploration and production profits showed strong
gains, but gasoline refining earnings declined.
