   Conventional wisdom errs in concluding Mikhail Gorbachev
would not use Red military power to "save the union" because
of "fear of destroying his international reputation as a man
of peace" ("Tense War of Nerves in Lithuania May Be
Backfiring for Gorbachev," March 26).
   Mr. Gorbachev's political base is the Russian nationality.
The percentage of Russians living in the 14 republics
excluding the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic
ranges from 2% in Armenia to 41% in Kazakhstan, where
Russians outnumber native Kazakhs. Latvia is one-third
inhabited by Russians, and 28% of the Estonian population is
Russian. On average, 17% of the 14 non-Russian republics is
Russian.

   The percentage of Russians living as inhabitants rather
than occupiers in what once was called Eastern Europe is
nearly zero. Predicting Mr. Gorbachev's behavior in
Lithuania, Latvia or Moldavia on his past behavior in Eastern
Europe is a false analogy. He had no nationalistic political
commitment to the Poles, Czechs, etc., but he has a deep,
back-to-the-czars political commitment to the Russian
nationals living outside the Russian S.F.S.R. These were sent
as colonizers to the other republics, first by the czars and
then by the Communists. If Mr. Gorbachev betrays them, is it
possible to believe he could retain the political support of
his power base, the Russians living in Russian S.F.S.R.?
   Conversations with Russians in Tallinn, Tbilisi, Alma-Ata,
Tashkent, Leningrad and Moscow convey the same message: "We
Russians made great sacrifices to industrialize and raise the
standard of living of the other republics. Now they are out
to ditch us. No way."
   Instead of mouthing pieties, the West and especially the
Bush administration should prepare for bloodshed rather than
being caught with their britches at half-mast as happened at
Tiananmen Square.
