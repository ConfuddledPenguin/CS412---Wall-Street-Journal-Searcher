   PARIS -- A day after the failure of its effort to acquire
Farmers Group Inc., France's Axa-Midi Assurances says it
already is beginning to look at six other possible U.S.
insurance acquisitions.
   Officials at Axa-Midi, one of France's largest insurance
companies, say that by selling real estate and unneeded
subsidiaries they could raise as much as $8 billion for
future acquisitions.

   They had anticipated paying $4.5 billion for Farmers, part
of a broader effort by Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake
Investments Ltd. to acquire B.A.T Industries Inc., Farmers'
parent. Axa-Midi officials say they could pay more than $4.5
billion for another concern, although they currently don't
plan to use the entire $8 billion on a single purchase. They
say they have acquisition hopes in Europe and Southeast Asia
as well.
   Axa-Midi Chairman Claude Bebear said he currently is
looking at four property and casualty insurance companies and
two life insurance companies in the U.S. They were presented
to him while he was touring the U.S. trying to convince
regulators to approve the Farmers acquisition. Unlike
Farmers, all would be friendly purchases.
   "In one case, a company chairman came to me and said his
capital was broadly dispersed," Mr. Bebear said. "He said he
fears a raid and prefers to choose his acquirer for himself.
In another case, a company chairman told me his current
parent intends to sell his company, and he asked whether I
would be interested."
   An acquisition the size of Farmers would make Axa-Midi the
largest French insurance group, and the first one with such a
strong U.S. presence.
