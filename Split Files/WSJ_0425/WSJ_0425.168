   Harsco Corp. rejected a proposal from an investor group to
restructure the company, but left open the possibility for
consideration of other proposals.
   Earlier this month, HC Partners of Washington, D.C., an
investor group led by former Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci and the Mellon family, proposed that Harsco sell off
its defense operations and pay a special cash dividend of $15
a share.

   The group offered to invest $100 million and possibly as
much as $200 million in the Camp Hill, Pa., construction,
defense and industrial concern as part of the proposed
restructing. The additional $100 million, if provided, would
have been used to accelerate Harsco's world-wide research,
development and marketing efforts, the group said.
   In a letter to Mr. Carlucci, M. W. Gambill, Harsco's chief
executive officer and president, said the proposal, which was
presented in a letter, was not in the best interest of the
company.
