   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel Corp. filed a lawsuit in
federal court in San Francisco against Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., claiming that Advanced infringed on an Intel copyright
on the company's microcode technology.
   Under a 1976 agreement between the two companies, Advanced
Micro is allowed to use and copy the technology for its own
use, but it isn't allowed to distribute it through sales of
its own products. The microcode technology, which is software
that tells a chip how to perform its function, is used in
Intel's 80287 math co-processor.

   The dispute began a month ago when Advanced Micro, a
Sunnyvale, Calif., chip maker, told Intel that it planned to
use the company's microcode techology in certain products for
distribution.
   "Obviously, we have a significantly different
understanding," said a spokesman for Advanced Micro. The
spokesman said it is the company's understanding, based on
the 1976 agreement, that Advanced can indeed use the Intel
technology in products beyond internal company use.
   Intel officials, however, maintain that the agreement
specifically bans the use of its technology for anything but
internal applications at Advanced. In its suit, the maker of
computer parts, boards and systems said it is seeking an
injunction.
