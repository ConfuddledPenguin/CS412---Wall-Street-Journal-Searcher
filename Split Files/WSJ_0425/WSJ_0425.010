   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Corp. said it will begin
converting its consumer film packaging this year to recycled
paperboard, which is produced from newspapers, corrugated
paperboard, carton stock and computer paper.
   The photographic, chemicals and pharmaceuticals concern
said improved technology enables it to reprint, with high
quality, its logo and other graphics on recycled stock. Kodak
said the new packaging wouldn't increase its costs or film
price.
