   Chips &amp; Technologies Inc., citing a sluggish market and a
shortage of chips, said net income for the fiscal third
quarter plunged 47% to $5 million, or 32 cents a share, from
$9.4 million, or 63 cents a share.
   Revenue in the quarter ended March 31 climbed 16% to $66.4
million from $57.4 million.

   The drop in earnings wasn't unexpected. The San Jose,
Calif., microchip manufacturer said several weeks ago that
its performance in the third quarter would be significantly
below that of its second quarter ended Dec. 31, when the
company reported revenue of $74.4 million and net income of
$8.9 million, or 57 cents ashare.
   The company's stock fell 62.5 cents yesterday in national
over-the-counter trading to close at $16.75 a share.
   The company said its more mature products continued to be
affected by pricing pressures in the sluggish computer
industry. The price declines on certain products were
exacerbated by a delay in the introduction of several
new-generation products, the company added.
