   LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co. said its first-quarter net
income fell 33% because of depressed advertising revenue and
higher costs stemming from circulation gains at the Los
Angeles Times.
   Net income for the quarter was $46 million, or 36 cents a
share. In the year-earlier quarter, Times Mirror reported net
of $68.8 million, or 53 cents a share. Revenue for the latest
quarter rose 3.3%, to $875.2 million from $846.9 million a
year ago.

   Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that, as expected, the company's first-quarter net was
hurt by "the weak performance of our advertising-supported
business lines," despite earnings growth in its professional
publishing and cable television operations.
   The newspaper publishing group's operating profit fell
38%, to $55.8 million, from $90.1 million. Increased revenue
at the Los Angeles Times was offset by higher operating costs
resulting from an increase in circulation, to a record 1.2
million daily and 1.5 million Sunday.
   Separately, Times Mirror said the newspaper publishing
group's ad revenue fell 0.2%, to $131.9 million, for the four
weeks ended April 1. For the first 13 weeks of 1990, ad
revenue fell 2%, to $413.9 million. The latest results
included 13 Sundays, one fewer than a year ago.
