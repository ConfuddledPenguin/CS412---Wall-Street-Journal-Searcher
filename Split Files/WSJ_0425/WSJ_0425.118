   BONN (AP) -- West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere named July 2 as the
date for economic and social union of the two Germanys, a
West German spokesman said.
   Union in those areas will bring the divided nation a long
way toward full unification after more than four decades of
separation following Germany's defeat in World War II. The
issue of political union, or holding an election to form a
single government, remains to be worked out.

   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, joined by their
colleagues from Britain, France and the two German states,
are scheduled to meet in Bonn May 5. They will try to resolve
difficult international aspects of unification, including
Germany's future military stance.
