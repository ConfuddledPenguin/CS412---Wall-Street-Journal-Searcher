   I was the founder and head of the High Yield and
Convertible Securities Department at Drexel. In pioneering
the creation of new instruments for the financing of
companies, most of which did not have access to the capital
markets because they did not have investment-grade ratings,
and in making markets in such securities, we operated under
unique, highly demanding, and intensely competitive
conditions. But I do not cite these conditions as excuses for
not conforming to all of the laws that governed our highly
regulated business. I am here today because in connection
with some transactions, I transgressed certain of the laws
and regulations that govern our industry. I was wrong in
doing so and knew that at the time and I am pleading guilty
to these offenses.
   One of the accounts we did business with was the Boesky
Organization, which also did business with many other firms.
Drexel did some financings for and trading with the Boesky
firm, but Drexel's business with the Boesky Organization
never approached one percent of the business of our
department. He traded in stocks; I traded primarily in bonds,
or their equivalent. But because he was a major factor in the
securities markets, he had the potential to become a more
significant account. We were not social friends, and had
little in common. His philosophy of business was different
from mine. The relationship started as an arms length and
correct one. Unfortunately, however, certain of our
transactions involved reciprocal accommodations, some of
which violated the law, including those that are referred to
in this allocution.

   In 1984, our department had purchased some securities of
Fischbach, a company in which Victor Posner had an interest.
Drexel had provided financing to several other companies
which Mr. Posner had an interest in. In early 1984, Mr.
Posner publicly announced that he intended to acquire
Fischbach. Boesky was familiar with the Fischbach situation
and wanted to purchase Fischbach securities. I encouraged him
to do so. I do not remember exactly what I told him almost
six years ago, but I indicated to him that he would not lose
money.
   The Boesky Organization began buying Fischbach securities
and eventually bought over 10% of Fischbach including
securities that had been owned by Drexel. Over the next
months, he called me incessantly to complain that the price
of the stock was dropping, that Drexel was responsible for
his losses, that my comments to him were guarantees against
loss and that he expected us to make good. I assured him that
Drexel would make good on his losses. These assurances were
not recorded on the books of Drexel and I did not expect that
they would be reflected in any Schedule 13d's filed by the
Boesky Organization, and, in fact they were not. Thus, I
assisted in the failure to file an accurate 13d. This was
wrong and I accept responsibility for it. This is the basis
for Count II and is one of the overt acts in Count One.
   As for Count III and the second overt act of the
Conspiracy Count, in the fall of 1984, a client of Drexel,
Golden Nugget, wanted to sell a substantial amount of MCA
stock. I wanted the shares to hit the market in a way that
would not identify our client as the seller and adversely
affect the price that it might receive. So I turned to
Boesky, whose business it was to buy and sell large amounts
of stock and who I knew had an interest in entertainment
company stocks, including MCA. I told a Drexel employee to
ask him to buy the blocks of MCA shares as they became
available from Drexel's client. I did not tell the client how
I was disposing of the stock. Drexel crossed the blocks
between its client and the Boesky Organization, which
subsequently resold most of these shares into the market.
When Boesky complained that he had lost money on his initial
purchases of MCA, I promised that we would make up any losses
the Boesky Organization suffered on its purchases and sales
and thereafter it bought more MCA stock from Drexel acting on
behalf of our client. This promise was not recorded on
Drexel's books nor made public and it was wrong not to do so.
It was my intent that the block sales would enable our client
to receive a better price than it might have obtained if I
had not agreed that Drexel would make up the Boesky
Organization's losses on the MCA stock.
   In July 1985, the Boesky Organization asked Drexel to
purchase approximately 1,000,000 shares of stock in Helmerich
&amp; Payne. The Boesky Organization agreed that it would
repurchase this stock in the future and promised that it
would make up any losses Drexel incurred while holding this
stock. Although I was not involved in the purchase of these
securities, I later learned of this understanding. I approved
this understanding. I also gave instructions to sell the
stock back. The understanding that the Boesky Organization
would make up any losses was an oral one and the stock while
held by Drexel was not, therefore, charged to the Boesky
Organization's net capital as required by the securities laws
and rules. This is the basis for Count IV and the third overt
act.
   As I stated earlier, there were other accommodations of a
similar nature between the Boesky Organization and Drexel,
some of which were wrong. After Boesky complained about his
losses and insisted that we make them up, I asked a Drexel
employee in early 1985 to check the amount of the losses that
the Boesky Organization had incurred. In order to make up
these losses, I caused Drexel to execute certain bond trades
which resulted in profits to the Boesky Organization.
Thereafter, a Drexel employee tried to keep track of how the
Boesky Organization stood, in terms of profits and losses, on
these and certain other transactions, though so far as I know
this score-keeping was never exact.
   Counts V and VI and the remaining overt acts relate to
transactions between Drexel and David Solomon. Mr. Solomon
was a portfolio manager who specialized in high-yield
securities. His company, Solomon Asset Management Company,
Inc., was a large customer of Drexel -- as well as of other
firms. Among the institutions for which Mr. Solomon managed a
high-yield portfolio was the Finsbury Fund, an offshore fund
that had been underwritten by a Drexel affiliate. Drexel paid
an annual 1% commission to its salesmen for selling this fund
abroad, and charged this commission to the High Yield
Department because the Finsbury Fund traded in high-yield
securities. Sometime in 1985, I agreed with Solomon and
officials of Drexel that the High Yield Department would
recoup the commission for Drexel. To attempt to do so, we
charged Solomon a fraction of a point more on certain
purchases he made for his clients or a fraction of a point
less on certain sales he made for his clients to help recoup
the 1% commission paid to Drexel salesmen. All adjustments
were to be within the bid/ask range for the particular
security at the time of the transaction. To the best of my
information, this was done on a number of trades and the
adjustments totaled several hundred thousand dollars.
   These adjustments were not disclosed by Drexel or me to
the shareholders of Finsbury or to Solomon's other clients.
The confirmations for Solomon's purchase of securities were
mailed by Drexel and did not disclose the adjustments or that
they were made to reimburse Drexel for the selling expenses
of the Finsbury Fund. This failure to disclose was wrong and
is the basis of Count V.
   In December 1985, Mr. Solomon asked whether Drexel could
engage in securities transactions with him on which he could
generate short-term losses for his personal income tax
purposes. In light of the customer relationship between Mr.
Solomon and Drexel, I assisted him in purchasing from Drexel
certain securities, set forth in the Information, which
traded at a significant spread between the bid and the ask
price. Drexel thereafter repurchased these securities at a
substantially lower price, thus generating a loss for him and
a profit for Drexel. I either told him that we would provide
him with an investment opportunity or opportunities in the
following year to make up his loss to him, or that was
implicit in the conversation. In fact, in the following year,
we did provide him an investment opportunity which turned out
to be profitable and ultimately more than made up the losses
he suffered. I thus assisted Mr. Solomon in taking a tax loss
to which he was not entitled, and this is the basis of Count
Six and the fifth overt act.
   Because of the tremendous amount of publicity that has
surrounded this case, I wish to make clear that my plea is an
acceptance of personal responsibility for my own failings and
actions, and not a reflection on the underlying soundness and
integrity of the segment of the capital markets in which we
specialized and which provided capital that enabled hundreds
of companies to survive, expand and flourish. Our business
was in no way dependent on these practices. Nor did they
comprise a fundamental part of our business and I regret them
very much.
   This investigation and proceeding are now in their fourth
year. This long period has been extremely painful and
difficult for my family and friends as well as myself. I
realize that by my acts I have hurt those who are closest to
me. I am truly sorry. I thank the Court for permitting me to
add this apology and for its fairness in handling this
complex case.
