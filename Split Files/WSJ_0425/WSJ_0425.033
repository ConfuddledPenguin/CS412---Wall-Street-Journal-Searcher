   NEW YORK -- Slattery Group Inc. said 865,064 common shares
had been tendered under its offer to purchase shares
outstanding at $30 each; the offer expired Monday.
   Getty Petroleum Corp., Jericho, N.Y., which prior to the
offer owned about 40% of the common shares of Slattery,
agreed not to tender any shares under the offer. Excluding
Getty's stake, about 99% of the shares outstanding have been
tendered.

   Slattery last year sold its construction subsidiary. Its
remaining assets consist of investments and contingent assets
and liabilities that mightn't be settled for several years.
