annual rate of 3.8% to 123.1 million barrels, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
   The imports also rose 1.5% from February.

   Oil-products sales in March fell 1% to 126.4 million
barrels, compared with a year earlier. Inventories rose 6.6%
to 71 million barrels, and production increased 7.9% to 101.6
million barrels.
   The effect of Japan's unusually warm winter could be seen
in kerosene sales, which fell 14% from March 1989 levels to
18.8 million barrels.
   Vehicle fuels showed the best sales increase in the month,
up 5.4% at 23.6 million barrels. Sales of naphtha and gasoil
each rose 4.9%. Sales of other products, including fuel oil
and jet fuel, declined.
   Product exports from Japan continued to climb in March, as
the government held to its refinery liberalization policy.
These exports more than tripled to 3.4 million barrels.
