   Shares of over-the-counter stocks slipped in the last hour
of trading, losing their grip on a morning rally as concerns
about rising interest rates and inflation fears continued to
haunt investors.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell .89, or 0.2%, to 419.19.
Trading remained light at 126.7 million shares, up slightly
from 125.9 million Monday. Advancing shares closed the gap
with declining stocks but still trailed, 870 to 1,040, while
191 stocks hit new lows and 57 struck new highs.

   Traders said technology issues were pressured by a late
afternoon news service report that Compaq's first-quarter
growth for domestic personal computer sales would be flat.
However, analysts at Goldman Sachs and Hambrecht &amp; Quist told
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report there was nothing new
in the report and they aren't changing their earnings
estimates for the computer maker.
   As shares of Compaq fell, Apple closed off 1 at 38 3/4,
Intel fell 1/2 to 39, Seagate Technology dropped 1 to 11 1/4
and Microsoft fell 1 to 58. The Nasdaq 100 index, which
tracks larger stocks and includes many technology shares,
fell 1.74 to 409.52.
   But most of the day was marked by cautious trading, much
of it among market dealers, traders said. E.E. "Buzzy"
Geduld, president of Herzog Heine Geduld, said market makers
trading among themselves accounted for more business than
institutional investors.
   In what trading institutions did conduct, "the stocks
moved sideways," said Robert O'Toole Sr., head of
institutional OTC trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. "These
stocks tried to bounce, but it was a standoff," he added.
   William Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
in Baltimore, suggested the market won't rally significantly
until fears about higher interest rates and inflation ease.
"You're going to have to see something positive happen on
that front to get a meaningful rally," Mr. Rothe said. He
added that investors continued to selectively buy "bargain
stocks."
   Finnigan was one of the day's biggest gainers, adding 4
1/2 to 18 3/4. The San Jose, Calif., maker of scientific
instruments signed a memorandum of understanding to be
acquired by Thermo Instrument Systems for $20 a share.
Finnigan also reported a first-quarter loss of 20 cents a
share yesterday, compared with year-earlier net income of six
cents a share.
   Weyenberg Shoe Manufacturing jumped 3 1/2 to 59 after
reporting first-quarter profit of $1.33 a share, up from
$1.23 a year before. The company, based in Milwaukee, also
declared a two-for-one stock split and increased the dividend
on a post-split basis to 15 cents a share from 12.5 cents.
Shareholders approved changing the company's name to Weyco
Group Inc.
   Peerless Manufacturing surged 3 to 35 on its fiscal
third-quarter earnings report. The Dallas maker of oil and
gas control equipment earned $1.51 a share in the quarter
ended March 31, up from six cents a year earlier.
   Image Bank fell 2 3/4 to 5 1/4 after restating its
first-quarter net income sharply downward. In February, the
photo agency said it had earned 12 cents a share in the
quarter ended Dec. 31, but yesterday restated that figure as
seven cents a share. The company said the earlier earnings
report failed to account for certain purchase invoices for
books that were included in the Dec. 31 inventory of its
recently acquired British unit, Book People Ltd.
   The American depositary receipts of AB Volvo closed
unchanged at 55 3/4. Pharmacia AB said its board unanimously
recommended that its shareholders accept tender offers by
Volvo and Procordia AB.
   Poughkeepsie Savings Bank was a loser among bank stocks.
It fell 1 to 5 1/8 after suspending its quarterly dividend
and reported a $2.21-a-share loss for the first quarter,
compared to net income of 53 cents a share a year earlier.
The bank made $8 million in loan-loss provisions in the
quarter.
