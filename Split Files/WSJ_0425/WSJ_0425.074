   Digital Equipment Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. will
announce long-awaited products next week that tie their
computers together.
   The expected products are the first fruits of a widely
heralded technology alliance disclosed two years ago. Kenneth
H. Olsen, Digital's president, and Apple's chief executive
officer, John Sculley, will show off the products next
Tuesday in New York.

   The software products permit Apple computers to operate
easily in Digital networks, sharing data files, printers and
other devices.
   The companies view the alliance as a strategic one, though
they concede it isn't likely to set off a flood of new sales.
Analysts say it should help Apple's prospects in commercial
and industrial accounts, where Apple has been slow to
penetrate, while shoring up Digital's appeal to desktop
computer users, where it historically has been weak. Digital,
based in Maynard, Mass., will market the products.
