   WASHINGTON -- Private industry's labor costs rose 1.6% in
the first quarter, the government said, accelerating from a
1.1% rise in the fourth period and a 1.2% increase in 1989's
first quarter.
   The increases were propelled by benefit increases,
including a rise in the Social Security taxes paid by
employers, the Labor Department said.

   "It's not an explosion but it's steady pressure," said
Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, a
business research organization. Many economists see the
labor-cost figure as an important indicator of inflation,
because salaries and benefits are a large share of business
costs and ultimately must be reflected in prices.
   In the 12 months ended in March, wages, salaries and
benefits for private sector employees increased 5.2%, the
biggest rise since they climbed 5.4% in the 12 months ended
June 1984. That figure was 4.8% for all 1989 and 4.6% in the
12 months ended in March of that year.
   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Labor Department said
major collective-bargaining agreements settled in the first
quarter provided wage increases averaging 3.8% in the first
year and 3.3% a year over the life of the pacts.
   Those figures were well above the ones in previous
contracts negotiated by the same parties. The previous
contracts, generally negotiated two or three years ago, paid
2.3% in the first year and 2.2% a year for the full term of
the contracts. The figures don't include benefits. Agreements
in the latest report covered 318,000 workers.
   Increases in benefits made up most of the 5.2% increase in
total compensation for workers over the 12 months ended in
March. Benefit costs to employers rose 7.2% in that period,
up from a 5.4% rise in the year-earlier period. Wages and
salaries rose only 4.2%, the same increase registered for the
12 months ended March 1989.
   White collar workers received wage and salary increases of
4.6% during the 12-month period, faring better than blue
collar workers, who posted gains of 3.7%. Labor costs
continued to increase more rapidly in services than in
goods-producing industries, though the difference was small
-- 4.2% versus 4%.
   Including employees of state and local governments, but
not federal employees, the department's employment cost index
rose 1.7% in the first quarter, compared with a 1.2% rise in
the first quarter of 1989. The index rose 1% in last year's
fourth quarter.
   In the 12 months ended in March, this index was up 5.5%.
It rose 5% for the full year 1989, and 4.8% in the 12 months
ended in March 1989.
   Unlike most of the government's economic statistics, none
of these figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.
