   Outside of a few redoubts such as North Korea and the
Chinese party headquarters, state-run industries are a
concept in retreat these days. But in retreat to where? To
the high councils of California] Air fares among major cities
in the state, including the capital of Sacramento, have risen
dramatically in recent months. Naturally, legislators are
upset. But instead of privatizing airports and piercing the
lock that existing carriers have on gates, State Senator Art
Torres has proposed formation of a state airline to --
believe it or not -- compete and hold prices down. In 1990,
some folks are still up in the clouds.
