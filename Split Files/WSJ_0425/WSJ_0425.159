   Michael Milken, who made the junk-bond market into a
behemoth that fueled the 1980s takeover boom, became a symbol
of the decade and of the central role of investment bankers
in U.S. business. Now that he's pleaded guilty to six felony
counts, The Wall Street Journal has sought comment from
interested and disinterested parties both on his plea-bargain
agreement and on how history will view him.

   Glenn A. Cox
   President, Phillips Petroleum Co.
                                                                                                       

   "We were caught up in what went on in the '80s and cast in
a negative light. Now as we focus sunlight on history, we see
that a lot of that activity occurred outside the law.
   There's some vindication of companies, including
ourselves, that were attempting to operate in a
straightforward manner when the people who were dealing with
us were dealing outside the law. It took a long time for all
that to come to light, but it helps recast the characters in
a different light. I'm not saying that everyone was operating
outside the law, but certainly a number of people identified
in the Phillips takeover activities have now been shown to
have operated outside the law.
   "The settlement, as I understand it, does probably shorten
the time frame that this thing could consume if allowed to
drag through the courts. Given the strong position the
government has, I'm glad to see the matter being resolved
today rather than dragged out another three, four, five
years." (Drexel provided financing for a run at Phillips
Petroleum by Carl Icahn.)
                                                                                                       

   Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Chairman, American Continental Corp.
                                                                                                       

   "You don't put Michelangelo or da Vinci in jail. To lose
that mind for even a day would be a tragedy."
   Instead, Mr. Keating suggests that the government could
thrust Mr. Milken into a central role in correcting the
savings-and-loan mess by making him chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. "A guy like Milken could bring
intelligence and common sense, and more important than that,
an ability to marshal talent."
   "Mike was a tremendous factor in the development of
America over the past eight years. The Reagan administration
was very fortunate to have Mike funding American enterprise
during the time Reagan was in office. It caused the economy
to be extremely stable and evolving.
   "I think that if Mike Milken's talents were applied to
government relationships -- in the economic field -- in South
America, that someone like Mike could design and implement
solutions that would cause the poor and starving to have
opportunities and to economically advance." (American
Continental had major junk-bond dealings with Drexel.)
                                                                                                       

   Rabbi Arnold Jacob Wolf
   KAM Isaiah Israel Congregation, Chicago
                                                                                                       

   The plea bargain doesn't provide harsh enough punishment
for Mr. Milken. "He should be hung by his thumbs for years
and years and years. He's a very terrible person. He's a
symptom of the worst in America at the end of the century.
Washington is full of corruption, and so is Wall Street and
everywhere. That's a symptom of yuppie values.
   "If you mention Milken {to kids at the synagogue}, they
would say, `He just got caught.' I think it's possible to be
more honest, but not a lot of kids here think it is.
White-collar crime is wrong. It just looks less malevolent
than it is."
                                                                                                       

   Joel Smilow
   Chief Executive, Playtex Apparel Inc.
   and Playtex Family Products Corp.
                                                                                                       

   "It's an American tragedy. He was such a clever guy who
was so brilliant and did contribute so much. It was a tragedy
that he had to be involved with activities that so tarnished
his reputation and removed him from the scene. He didn't need
to do what he admitted to." (The Playtex companies were
clients of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Mr. Milken's firm.)
                                                                                                       

   Gary Lynch
   Former enforcement director,
   Securities and Exchange Commission
                                                                                                       

   The plea bargain with the government and the SEC
settlement "achieve much of what would've been achieved in
litigation," said Mr. Lynch, a partner at the New York law
firm of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell. "One of the benefits to the
government is that Milken at this point cooperates; it's
likely to lead to other SEC actions and perhaps other
criminal actions." (Mr. Lynch led prominent SEC
insider-trading cases against Drexel and Milken, Ivan Boesky
and Dennis Levine.)

   Stephen A. Wynn
   Chairman, Chief Executive,
   Golden Nugget Inc.
                                                                                                       

   "People will say he pleaded guilty to six counts so he's
guilty, but we're not dealing with a normal scenario here.
It's possible to squeeze people tight enough so that reality
gets distorted, and I'm not sure that's not what's happened.
   "He doesn't belong in prison. His energy should be used
somewhere else.
   "The agony of it is that he'll never know if he did the
right thing" in agreeing to the plea bargain. "He made the
decision for his brother and his {Lowell's} children, because
he didn't want Lowell to be prosecuted.
   "Michael Milken is far from over. He's a man of such
unusual gifts, and such an extraordinary fellow . . . he'll
put all his creative energy and brilliance to work in a way
that will be rewarding to him and the people he works with."
(Mr. Milken helped Golden Nugget become the first casino
operator to use junk bonds.)
                                                                                                       

   Alan Dershowitz
   Professor, Harvard Law School
                                                                                                       

   "The plea bargain is calculated to keep the public in the
dark about the real stakes. . . . We'll never know what he
did." But while the bargain may enable Mr. Milken to claim
that he didn't cut a deal to cooperate with prosecutors, "I
guarantee there will be a secret letter . . . sent to the
judge, outlining his secret cooperation. This deal smells of
that.
   "In a case of this public interest . . . the prosecutor
has an obligation to announce all the terms, implicit and
explicit," behind the plea bargain.
                                                                                                       

   Palomba Weingarten
   Chairman, Chief Executive,
   Pilgrim Group of Mutual Funds
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Milken will be remembered as "a man who created a
revolution that allowed small and medium-sized companies to
finance their growth." He was forced to plea bargain "because
otherwise he would have been blamed with things that had
nothing to do with him, including Drexel's going out of
business and people losing their jobs.
   "Mike Milken's problem is that he never developed a
constituency; he should have brought more people in the
investment community into the loop who could have better
explained what he was doing instead of shaking their fingers
at him." (Pilgrim's former parent, First Capital Holdings
Corp., was a client of Drexel.)
                                                                                                       

   Steven Sandler
   Legal Aid Society lawyer in New York
                                                                                                       

   "None of my clients who had six felonies would have a
chance of being out on bail." There's "clearly a different
standard. . . . The more you steal, and you're white, the
better you do. Even if {Mr. Milken} goes to jail, the jail he
goes to is a country club . . . and he'll have a few bucks
left when he gets out."
                                                                                                       

   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich)
   Chairman, House Energy
   And Commerce Committee
                                                                                                       

   "The government's agreement with Mr. Milken raises more
questions than it answers."
   "The fines assessed amount to less than a year's
compensation for Mr. Milken, according to the most
conservative estimates. How does this affect the rights of
the companies and individuals who have been victimized in
these cases? Why is Justice not pursuing the others who were
indicted with Milken and his brother Lowell? Why is the
government not getting Mr. Milken's full cooperation in other
cases as the public interest demands?"
   Mr. Dingell also questioned why Mr. Milken wasn't charged
with any violations stemming from his junk-bond transactions.
He said his committee provided the Justice Department
information two years ago on them. He said he will give Mr.
Milken "every opportunity" to testify before his panel. He
also said the committee will review the settlement.
   "At this point, I can only wonder if the Mikado would be
satisfied that `the punishment fit the crime.'"
                                                                                                       

   Earl G. Graves
   Publisher, Black Enterprise magazine
                                                                                                       

   "Mike Milken and Drexel led the way in doing business with
black America. Because of them, big U.S. corporations are
increasing their involvement with black companies."
   Mr. Milken "may have lost sight of what else he was
supposed to do." But he has done some very positive things
not only in business but in education and in charitable
giving, Mr. Graves says.
   The plea bargain "is quite acceptable. If you can get him
to pay $600 million and still serve time, justice will have
been served."
                                                                                                       

   John Bogle
   Chairman, Vanguard Group
                                                                                                       

   "I think history will judge Mike Milken and the high-yield
bonds as one of the great financial excesses of the latter
part of the 20th century. I thought a trial would be a good
thing. That way, we would have more than just opinion to go
on in deciding whether this thing was one great fraud or just
some minor technical violations of the law. I tend to lean
toward it being more than just technical violations."
                                                                                                       

   Studs Terkel
   Radio Personality, Oral Historian
                                                                                                       

   "The whole thing depresses me with Milken and {Ivan}
Boesky. We live in a corrupt, amoral moment set by the powers
above -- Iran-contra, Oliver North." Mr. Milken "is par for
the course. There are a million Milkens, and he doesn't
deserve even a footnote in history. He's reflective of our
society at this time." But he probably won't be chastised in
the history books. "People have lost their sense of outrage."
                                                                                                       

   H. Ross Perot
   Financier
                                                                                                       

   "He {Mr. Milken} caused a great deal of destruction that
will continue on for a number of years. It's a tragic waste
of talent when business and society encourage this kind of
activity. The financial community and the media lionized him
and made it possible for this destruction to occur."
   Mr. Perot said he is uncomfortable with plea bargains but
he felt it was probably the best thing the government could
do under the circumstances. "When you have a revolving door
of prosecutors, you're placed in an inherently weakened
position. One of the lessons learned is that we really have
to come up with a way for government to go into the private
sector and hire world-class attorneys who have the background
and skills to handle a case like this and who will see the
case through to a conclusion."
   A lesson for young businessmen is: "Don't govern your life
by what's legal or illegal, govern it by what's right or
wrong."
                                                                                                       

   Kurt O. Hanson
   Lecturer, Business Ethics,
   Stanford Business School
                                                                                                       

   "Cases of this type almost require a plea-bargaining
process because of their complexity. . . . To me, such a plea
bargain outcome will only be just if it results in some
prison time. The stigma, particularly to a business person,
of doing time is among the most severe penalties.
   "In some ways, Milken should be the symbol of the 1980s
because he both contributed a lot and was so blind to
procedures of fairness and fair dealing in so many day-to-day
transactions. He also will be remembered as yet one more
individual who believed his own press releases and thought
that junk bonds were the solution to every company's and
investor's problems."

   Managing Director,
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. ratings services
                                                                                                       

   "I'm not sure whether Milken was a villain or a victim.
The initial premise behind junk bonds was probably correct.
For fallen-angel companies, the world thought credit quality
was a lot worse than it was. Milken and others earned very
generous returns by investing in those bonds. It was a good
idea in the beginning.
   "Clearly it went too far. Aggressive takeovers led to
financial excess. The average credit rating declined from
single-A in the early 1980s to double-B now. There was a lot
of propaganda that ratings were irrelevant. That's over now.
   "I don't think we're laughing to see Milken gone. I have a
suspicion that in the end, he and Drexel were unfairly blamed
for a lot of problems."

   The $600 million "is a stiff fine. Justice will probably
be served by it. I have trouble, unless we're just punishing
for vengeance's sake, sending anybody off to the
penitentiary. They're punishing the SOB enough by taking his
money away. That's a hell of a fine.
   "Everyone wants to see the mighty fall. I'm afraid it
would be difficult for the man to receive a fair trial. A
jury wouldn't understand everything. Now I love juries, but I
don't know about this one. Arthur {Liman} did him a hell of a
job.
   "Those who made money will love {Mr. Milken}. Those who
didn't are going to hate him. Friends want you to be
successful, but not too successful."

   The Milken and Boesky affairs are "a far worse cancer than
Iran-Contra. . . . I was curious about where he's going to
get" the $600 million in fines and restitution. "It makes a
fairly clear point to anyone who's listening carefully."

   "These corporate takeovers {that Mr. Milken's junk bonds
financed} certainly haven't helped our work force -- as a
matter of fact, they've hurt. They've caused companies to
spend a lot of their money on lawyers and lining their
executives' pockets, instead of putting the money into
research and developing new products."

   "I think history will be a mixed review. It's hard to take
someone who accomplished so much and paint him totally black.
On the other hand, it's hard to find high praise for someone
who is guilty by his own admission."
   "He's the only one who saw the whole set of cards. He's
very smart and very sophisticated. He wouldn't have done it
{plead guilty} if he didn't have good reason."
   "This whole era of flagrant securities violation has been
marked by very effective work by the SEC and the other
law-enforcement agencies. On the other hand, it was also
marked by some extravagances . . . I think they {law
enforcers} have restored much of their credibility by
