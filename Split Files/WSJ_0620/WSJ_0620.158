   WASHINGTON -- The House, brushing aside demands for budget
cuts, approved a $20.8 billion fiscal 1991 energy and water
bill providing for a 12.7% increase from current spending
levels and accelerating funding for the cleanup of
nuclear-weapons plants.
   The final 355-59 roll call last night capped a day of
defeats for the Republican leadership, which saw many of its
own rank and file repeatedly join Democrats to oppose efforts
for across-the-board spending cuts.

   More than 40 Republicans opposed a final bipartisan effort
to impose a reduction of 2%, or $400 million, in the bill,
and the debate underscored the immense difficulties that will
face budget negotiators if and when they bring back a
deficit-reduction package from their budget summit talks with
the Bush administration.
   "I am really depressed," said Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel,
the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. "They
think the deals are being made in the summit and someone else
can be a hero for them."
   The support summoned for the bill reflects the strength of
the energy and water coalition, which still can win support
among traditionally conservative Southern and Western
delegations even as it now champions more liberal
environmental and scientific initiatives.
   The measure funds an estimated 33 Army Corps of Engineers
construction projects that weren't included in President
Bush's budget, and the total of nearly $3.28 billion for
cleaning up nuclear plants represents an increase of $488
million from the administration's request and more than $1
billion from fiscal 1990, which ends Sept. 30.
   The opposition began at a disadvantage, but the
Republicans also appeared hurt by their failure to frame
clearer choices. The GOP leadership has yet to offer an
alternative budget of its own this year, and in a bill laden
with funding for parochial interests, the one Republican
amendment targeted at a specific account was offered by a
Midwestern lawmaker, who conceded he knew little about the
California power provision that a taxpayers' lobby had asked
him to oppose.
   By contrast, the Democratic leadership appears determined
to use the appropriations process aggressively, both to put
pressure on the summit talks and to spell out the party's
domestic priorities going into the fall elections. On
back-to-back procedural votes, Democrats overrode Republican
objections to taking up spending bills without a final budget
resolution, and by a 276-136 margin, the chamber approved a
resolution making the House budget the guide for dividing
discretionary spending between domestic and military
accounts.
   Among major science accounts, the bill provides the full
$318 million sought by the administration for the
superconducting supercollider. While spending on magnetic
fusion would be frozen near current levels, high-energy
physics programs would grow almost 6% to $621.2 million.
   Reflecting the pressure of Midwestern Republicans on the
House Appropriations Committee, funding for biofuels energy
programs would rise to $36 million, more than double current
levels and 28% above the administration request. Similarly in
solar-energy accounts, where Mr. Bush asked for large
increases, the bill bids up the president and reflects the
political ties of companies in photovoltaic research.
   Despite its financial troubles, Lawrenceville, N.J.-based
Chronar Corp. is a major force here, for example, with its
strong financial ties to the Sheet Metal Workers pension fund
as well as investors or projects in the home districts of
Appropriations Committee members from California and Alabama.
