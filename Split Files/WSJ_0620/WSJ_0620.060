   FRANKFURT -- Continental AG of West Germany, having
already sealed cooperation links with a major East German
tire maker, has now signed a similar pact with
Czechoslovakia's largest tire company for a quick start in
Eastern Europe.
   The state-owned Barum Group has three major plants that
together produce 3.4 million radial tires for passenger cars
and 2.5 million truck tires annually. The Czechoslovak
enterprise, which supplies tires to the domestic Skoda auto
works and other auto producers in Eastern Europe, had 1989
annual sales of about $441 million and employs 10,000
workers.

   Hanover-based Continental, expected to plow fresh
investments into the Barum venture, said it is still
undecided whether the cooperation will be in the form of a
joint venture or a straight equity stake in Barum.
   "It could be anything. It may take six months, but our
goal is to have the framework set in November," said
Continental spokesman Dieter von Herz.
   Although committed to a business link, both sides are
waiting for the passage of legislation by Czechoslovakia's
newly elected parliament that would privatize industry and
allow foreign purchases of domestic companies. Prague's newly
elected democratic government, eager to attract foreign
investment to modernize its sluggish economy, has pledged
quick free-market reforms by autumn.
   Several Western companies have entered into talks with
Czechoslovak companies, but few deals have been signed ahead
of the parliamentary green light.
   Continental didn't wait, said Mr. von Herz, because "Barum
is extremely interesting to us. They have their market, and
the technical status of their plants is remarkably good for
Eastern Europe."
   Continental, the world's fourth-largest tire company, last
month reported net group profit of 227.8 million Deutsche
marks ($135.9 million) on 1989 sales of 8.38 marks billion.
Continental last year produced 50 million passenger car tires
and 8.5 million truck tires.
   A common thread linking the acquisitions also has been
Continental's longstanding business ties with Volkswagen AG,
a major client for its tires. Volkswagen is negotiating with
Skoda for a joint production agreement.
   Continental recently secured an agreement to pursue a
business linkup with East Germany's VEB Reifenkombinat
Fuerstenwalde, which controls five plants producing 8.5
million tires for cars and trucks annually. Continental also
acquired three major makers of other automotive rubber
products in East Germany.
   A major client of the East German tire and rubber groups
has been East German car maker IFA-Kombinats
Personnenkraftwagen, with which Volkswagen signed a joint
production pact earlier this year as part of Volkswagen's 5
billion mark investment program in East Germany.
   While Continental is moving hard into the East, analysts
observe that other international tire producers are hard on
its heels.
   "All the big tire companies are following the auto makers
into the East. Most of them are looking for state-owned firms
that they can pick up and restructure," said Peter Sedlmeier,
an analyst for Bayerische Hypotheken-&amp; Wechsel-Bank AG.
