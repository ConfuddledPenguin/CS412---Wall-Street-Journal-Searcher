   MICRON PRODUCTS Inc. (New York) -- Anthony A. Cetrone was
named president, succeeding Kuno Laren. Mr. Cetrone, 58 years
old, will function as the top executive, although the title
of chief executive officer won't be used, said Mr. Laren, 66,
who remains chairman. Mr. Cetrone was president of the Micron
Medical Products Inc. subsidiary, which makes sensors used in
medical electrodes. Separately, Micron said its Numedco unit,
which distributes medical and surgical supplies, decided to
scale down its business. Numedco has had losses for the past
seven quarters since it took on acquisition-related debt.
