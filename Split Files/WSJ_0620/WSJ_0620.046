   NEW YORK -- New American Magazine Co., the debt-laden
publisher of Smart, Psychology Today and Mother Earth News,
said it is discussing the sale of a half-interest in the
company to a Japanese publisher.
   Owen Lipstein, president and controlling shareholder of
New American, said the Japanese company, which he declined to
identify, signed a letter of intent in May to "put
substantial equity into the company."

   Although Japanese concerns haven't previously made any
significant investments in the U.S. publishing industry,
Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates, the New York-based investment
banker, linked Mr. Lipstein with an interested Japanese
publisher.
   Meanwhile, Terry McDonnell, who founded Smart with Mr.
Lipstein, said that a U.S. publisher has shown "serious"
interest in purchasing the 250,000-circulation men's
life-style magazine started last year. He declined to
identify the publisher, but industry executives said Playboy
Enterprises Inc. and Straight Arrow Publishers Inc.,
publisher of Rolling Stone, are among possible bidders.
   A spokeswoman for Playboy said, "We are talking" to Smart,
"but we aren't even close to a deal. We are talking to a lot
of other magazines too." Straight Arrow executives said
through a spokesman that they are "not interested."
   Mr. Lipstein acknowledged in an interview that New
American is strapped for cash and last week laid off 30
staffers, or about 50% of the employees, at all three of the
magazines. The layoffs follow the departure of a number of
top sales and editorial executives from the staffs of the
magazines.
   A number of smaller publishers, such as New American, have
been hurt by an industrywide downturn in advertising sales,
and some consumer magazines have folded. But Mr. Lipstein
said most of the company staffers laid off will be rehired
"when new partners come aboard." And he dismissed industry
speculation that New American may soon become another
industry fatality. "We're just operating on a tighter
schedule," Mr. Lipstein said. "We are still alive."
   Earlier this year, Mr. Lipstein kept creditors and
investors at bay when he sold his flagship magazine, American
Health, to Reader's Digest Association Inc. for $29.1
million. He also halted publication of Psychology Today in
December and said it would be redesigned and relaunched this
fall.
