   ALBANY, N.Y. -- This is a ticket that's not going to play
on Broadway -- or hardly anywhere else in New York State.
   It's the Republican ticket headed by Pierre Rinfret, a
wealthy economics consultant from New York City, running for
governor against Democrat Mario Cuomo and already in hot
water.

   But it's only the latest calamity to befall the state's
once-proud GOP, the empire that was built by Thomas Dewey and
Nelson Rockefeller. The state party is broke, its upstate
base is crumbling, and even Suffolk County, a Long Island
bastion, has strayed from the GOP path. Worst of all, command
of the GOP fortress, the state Senate, lost to the Democrats
only once (in 1965, for a single year) since World War II, is
at risk.
   This could be the year that sets the course of New York
politics for a decade.
   Mr. Rinfret (pronounced Rin-fray) is the obvious and
visible symbol of the party's disarray. He was literally
chosen out of an address book -- Laurence Leeds's address
book. Mr. Leeds is a Manhattan investment banker who was
asked for help by a desperate state Sen. Roy Goodman, a
member of a search committee charged with finding a
candidate. Mr. Leeds flipped through the pages until he came
to "R," and there was "Rinfret, Pierre." The 66-year-old Mr.
Rinfret agreed to make the run, reportedly pledging anywhere
from $100,000 to $500,000 of his own resources as "earnest
money" and holding out the possibility that his wealthy
clients would come up with lots more. He enrolled as a
Republican after he was chosen as the party's standard
bearer. His running mate, George Yancey Jr., the candidate
for lieutenant governor, runs Heluva Good Cheese Inc., in
Sodus, in upstate New York. His friends call Mr. Yancey
Geoff.
   The first sign of future trouble was the disclosure that
Mr. Rinfret wasn't even a Republican. He was a registered
independent who thought he was a Republican.
   What frustrates many GOP strategists is the belief that
it's the Democrats who should be in trouble. The state's
economy, which performed vigorously through 1988, is in sharp
retreat, and Gov. Cuomo managed to put together this year's
budget only "by using every ounce of preventive medicine,"
according to Richard Nathan, director of the Nelson
Rockefeller Institute of Government here. "He exhausted all
the possibilities. Now things get really tough."
   But not a single leading Republican would listen to J.
Patrick Barrett, the GOP state chairman and former chairman
of Avis Inc., when he made the rounds with a briefcase full
of statewide polls suggesting Mr. Cuomo was more vulnerable
than most people realized. They all turned him down. "And
so," says Michael Haselswerdt, a political scientist at
Canisius College in Buffalo, "the former Avis chairman was
forced -- appropriately enough -- to rent a Republican."
   And as soon as the decision was made, the man who headed
the GOP wish list, Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Jack Kemp, turned what appeared to be an
embarrassment-in-the-making into low comedy. He lambasted Mr.
Rinfret for emphasizing the death penalty as a campaign issue
instead of Mr. Cuomo's record on taxes, and suggested -- the
unkindest cut of all -- that Mr. Rinfret, who once advised
President Nixon and who now makes millions as a consultant,
doesn't understand how the economy functioned in the Reagan
years.
   The New York Times weighed in with a front-page story
suggesting Mr. Rinfret fraudulently claims the title
"doctor," even though he has never earned a doctorate. (His
official campaign biography says that he "completed graduate
studies in political economy" at the University of Dijon, in
France, in 1950 and that he received an honorary doctor of
laws degree from Pepperdine University in 1973.) The Times
also reported that some former Nixon advisers deny Mr.
Rinfret was a major adviser to the president. (At the time,
though, he was quoted in the syndicated Evans and Novak
column with such frequency that he irritated White House
colleagues.)
   Mr. Rinfret issued a statement saying it is his "earnest
hope that the Times will focus attention on the real issues
of this campaign" and released a letter from former President
Nixon saying he had hoped Mr. Rinfret "would join my
administration as a member of the Council of Economic
Advisers or later as a member of the cabinet."
   If Mr. Rinfret turns out to be a calamitous choice to head
the ticket, Republicans will have only themselves to blame.
   Party professionals worry that an election that should be
a referendum on Mr. Cuomo's performance in office is turning
out to be a showcase for Mr. Rinfret's astonishing,
freewheeling performance. In his initial outings, Mr. Rinfret
promised he would privatize New York City's subways, airports
and bridges. "He's just inviting someone to ask if he's had
any good offers for the Brooklyn Bridge," says Marist
Institute pollster Lee Miringoff.
   Mr. Rinfret caused veteran GOP operatives to blanch when
he invited a woman reporter to his inaugural ball -- and
urged her to leave her husband at home. He threatens to
become an East Coast version of Texas' Clayton Williams, that
state's gaffe-prone Republican candidate for governor, the
difference being that Texans may be more tolerant of
political eccentricity than New Yorkers.
   To make matters worse, two other parties appealing to
prospective GOP voters, the Conservative and Right to Life
parties, are running their own anti-abortion candidates for
governor. Mr. Rinfret supports abortion rights for women, in
line with the state party's recently adopted stance.
   "The Republican Party has lost its way," says Michael
Long, chairman of the Conservative Party. "Our party is
running the only bona fide Republican in the race" -- Herbert
London, a dean at New York University, who sought the
Republican endorsement. "When this election is over," says
Mr. Long, "Pierre Andre Rinfret will be gone. He's not
sticking around to rebuild the Republican Party."
   A thorough rebuilding is what the state party needs. So
far, however, the most visible commitment has been the
$250,000 Mr. Barrett spent to refurbish the party's elegant
townhouse headquarters. "We thought it was important," says
Mr. Barrett. (The Democrats rent shabby space in an
undistinguished downtown office building.)
   The state party also borrowed $400,000 to buy a
state-of-the-art computer system for the GOP state Senate
campaign committee, which is already rolling in money. "We're
very generous," says Mr. Barrett. To top it off, the party's
bookkeeping is under investigation by the State Board of
Elections.
   Traditionally, the party's base has been upstate and in
the New York City suburbs. But, Mr. Barrett acknowledges,
"there has been some erosion in our base." In upstate New
York, Democrats now control Erie County (including Buffalo)
and Monroe County (Rochester) and even Broome County
(Binghamton). On Long Island, they control Suffolk County.
The Republicans have fallen back on machine-controlled Nassau
and Westchester counties.
   "They've lost their triple-A minor-league franchises,"
says William Cunningham, a political consultant who speaks
for the state Democratic Party.
   But the scariest part of all for the GOP is its fear that
it could lose control of the 61-seat state Senate, the
party's last remaining bastion. (The Democrats traditionally
control the Assembly and they have held the governor's seat
for the past 16 years.) The Democrats need a net gain of four
Senate seats to win control.
   "If we lose the Senate," says Robert Haggerty, executive
director of the Republican Senate campaign committee, "we
lose everything." With Democrats in control everywhere, says
Mr. Haggerty, they would redistrict the state legislature and
the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. "They will
redistrict us out of business," Mr. Haggerty says. At a time
when the state faces a post-census loss of three seats to
redistricting, the Republicans fear they could lose six to
unfettered Democratic gerrymandering.
   And so the money is bypassing the state party and flowing
directly to the Senate races. "They'll spend $4 million,"
says the Democrats' Mr. Cunningham. "We'll spend $1 million."
   The importance the national party puts on these Senate
races was highlighted earlier this week. Vice President Dan
Quayle had been scheduled to attend a fund-raiser for the
state party. But those plans were changed; Monday night, he
attended a $5,000-a-plate dinner for the state Senate
committee.
