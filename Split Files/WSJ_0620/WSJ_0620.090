   State Farm Insurance Cos., the largest auto insurer in
Pennsylvania, has agreed to comply with the state's new auto
insurance law, which goes into effect next month.
   In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey said he
believes State Farm's settlement "will induce other companies
to comply with the law." With State Farm, 181 of the 224
companies writing auto insurance in Pennsylvania have agreed
to roll back their rates as mandated by the new law.

   The 43 companies that haven't complied include Allstate
Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., and Erie
Insurance Co., two of the larger auto insurers in the state.
"We will see people shifting (their policies) and moving to
other companies," Gov. Casey said at a news conference
yesterday afternoon. Companies that don't comply could "risk
losing policyholders," he said.
   State Farm insures 1.4 million cars in Pennsylvania,
representing about 18% of the state's market. The company
wrote $309 million in auto insurance premiums last year in
Pennsylvania, or about 2% of the total. State Farm, a mutual
company which is owned by its policyholders, is the largest
auto insurer in the country.
   Pennsylvania's auto insurance law, enacted in February,
requires insurers to drop auto rates 10% for all drivers and
22% for drivers who waive their right to sue in all but the
most severe accidents. The lower rates are scheduled to go
into effect July 1.
   James Tuite, State Farm's counsel, said the company felt
compelled to come to some agreement with state officials if
it wanted to continue to do business in Pennsylvania: "This
law presented a dilemma. The coverages had been changed. We
couldn't issue old bills, use old rates and still go on with
our business while we challenged the new law. We had to file
new rates."
   Although State Farm has made peace with Pennsylvania
officials, "we're still concerned that the rollbacks aren't
justified" by the cost-saving measures in the new law, Mr.
Tuite said.
   The agreement between State Farm and Pennsylvania calls
for the state Insurance Department to hold a hearing today to
determine what base rate State Farm will use for calculating
the 10% and 22% premium reductions. The company had filed for
a 2.3% increase last October. The department will issue its
decision by Friday, and State Farm has agreed to file
immediately the rollbacks calculated on that base.
   State Farm and the state also agreed to let a Pennsylvania
court decide whether State Farm can include the 2.3% increase
in its base rate. The state contends that the rate filing was
rendered void when the new law was enacted. The company says
it should be allowed to include the increase because the
filing predated the law. If the company prevails, Gov. Casey
said, policyholders will probably see rate rollbacks of about
8% and 20%. Oral arguments were heard last week, and a
decision is pending.
   The company says it would lose $103 million in one year on
an underwriting basis if it were required to roll back rates
from current levels. Even if it included its net investment
income in its rate-of-return calculations, State Farm said,
it would still have a loss.
   The state agreed to drop State Farm from a lawsuit it
filed against six major insurers seeking to force them to
comply with the new law. Four other State Farm cases
currently pending also will be dropped, the Insurance
Department said.
