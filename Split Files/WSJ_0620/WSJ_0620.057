   It took place far away and long ago, but the drama of
Great Britain's First Afghan War (1839-42) continues to
fascinate. There was a terrible completeness about the
tragedy that made it exemplary and therefore timeless. The
British army of the Indus, a splendidly equipped force of
more than 15,000 troops, seemed to be invincible as it set
out for Afghanistan, but only one of its soldiers survived
the nightmarish retreat from Kabul to Jalalabad to describe
the catastrophe that overtook it.
   The object of the invasion was to depose the Afghan ruler
Dost Mohammed. The governor general of India, Lord Auckland,
ordered the invasion because he was persuaded by his adviser,
Sir William Hay Macnaghten, that Dost Mohammed, if allowed to
remain ruler, might one day strike a deal with expansionist
Russia at Britain's expense. It was an unlikely surmise, but
on the basis of it the British invaded Afghanistan in order
to make it anti-Russian -- and succeeded only in making it
anti-British.

   The story of the war is a tale rich in folly, irony and
human weakness, animated by timeless characters one might
well encounter today or tomorrow. Macnaghten, the chief
architect of Lord Auckland's calamitous policy, was a
brilliant, arrogant, opinionated man who committed mistake
after mistake without realizing, let alone admitting it. In
the end, life imitated theater when he walked into a trap.
   Disregarding the advice of his colleagues ("I understand
these things better than you do," he told them), he tried
double-dealing with a triple-dealing Afghan prince. Smug in
his knowledge of native etiquette, Macnaghten obligingly
presented a ceremonial gift to the prince at their meeting: a
handsome pair of pistols. Need any theatergoer or television
viewer be told that when the prince murdered Macnaghten the
following morning, it was with one of those pistols?
   It is with characters such as Macnaghten, with anecdote,
and with exotic local color that John H. Waller principally
concerns himself in his wonderfully entertaining new book,
"Beyond the Khyber Pass: The Road to British Disaster in the
First Afghan War" (Random House, 329 pages, $24.95). Mr.
Waller, who served in the OSS during World War II and in the
Foreign Service thereafter, retired in 1980 after four years
as inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency. He
knows the Moslem East at firsthand, and his enthusiastic
interest in the more exotic customs of the region is
infectious.
   It is sex that interests him most. He tells us of "illicit
lusts," "debauchery," and of a household-full of "black-eyed
damsels" that one man proposed to give another as a gift; and
of the "wanton spectacle" presented by "scantily clad dancing
girls." He describes harem games in which naked ladies
skidded down slides onto their waiting lord and master. We
hear of rulers who kept 600 or more women; and are told that
the great Sikh monarch Ranjit Singh, who at one time indulged
immoderately in the pleasures that his hundreds of women
afforded him, grew so old and weak that he could only look at
his harem ladies; for sexual activity he was obliged (we are
told) to turn to a 13-year-old boy. And we learn that in
Central Asia, the reason no man but a mullah is allowed to
climb to the top of a minaret is that minarets command a view
of women sunning themselves on the roofs.
   Mr. Waller's high-spirited tale of travel and adventure is
the stuff of which paperback romance novels are made;
unfortunately, so is its style. Attacks are always "vicious"
and beatings "merciless." Advances are "inexorable" and
horrors "unspeakable." Travelers cross "arid" deserts; but is
there a desert that isn't arid? Shown a funeral rite in which
wives and slave girls were burned alive with their master's
corpse, need we be told that the ritual was "cruel" -- surely
readers could have figured that out for themselves?
   Then, too, after all the coy 19th-century language
("maidens," "damsels" and so on) it jars when the
psychobabbling euphemisms of the 20th-century unexpectedly
intrude, as when the relationship of Princess Lieven
(Dorothea von Beckendorff) to Lord Palmerston, who probably
was her lover, is described as "Dorothy had been very close
to him."
   Mr. Waller seems to be more interested in dealing with the
people than with the politics of the First Afghan War, unlike
J.A. Norris (1967), who tried to make sense of Auckland's
otherwise puzz1ing decisions by placing them in the context
of Britain's world policy, or T.A. Heathcoate (1980), to whom
Auckland's murkiness of mind seemed unsurprising in a high
government official. Mr. Waller does not convincingly convey
to readers his theory of what the leaders of British India
thought they were doing when pursuing what looked even then
-- for example, to Alexander Burnes, Britain's man on the
spot in Kabul -- to be a senseless policy. Indeed, when
dealing with politics the author's attention seems to wander;
in all likelihood it is somewhere back there among those
scantily clad dancing girls.
