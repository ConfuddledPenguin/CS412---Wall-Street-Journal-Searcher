   NEW YORK -- Ernst &amp; Young said it received approval from
the Soviet Ministry of Finance to perform official audits for
joint ventures of Soviet and Western companies.
   The approval given to the professional-services firm to
audit balance sheets of the ventures follows similar approval
given to Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., another major accounting and
consulting firm.

   In addition, Ernst &amp; Young said Oleg Valerious, director
of the official Soviet audit agency, Inaudit, was joining
Ernst &amp; Young's joint venture in the Soviet Union, Ernst &amp;
Young Vneshaudit. The venture is 50%-owned by Ernst &amp; Young,
45%-owned by Vneshconsult, a Soviet management consulting
firm, and 5%-owned by Vneshtechnika, a state
technical-services organization.
   The Ernst &amp; Young venture in the Soviet Union has offices
in Moscow and Kiev; it currently does work in accounting in
addition to some tax and consulting. A spokeswoman for Ernst
&amp; Young said the approval enables the firm to offer a full
range of tax services as well.
