   SECAUCUS, N.J. -- Jamesway Corp. said Arlie G. Lazarus
resigned as president and chief operating officer, effective
Aug. 3.
   The 52-year-old Mr. Lazarus, the discount-store operator's
No. 2 officer, said, "Since I have been president of Jamesway
for over 12 years, it is now time to move on to something
new."

   Herbert Fisher, 68 years old, remains chairman and chief
executive officer of the company, which operates 132 stores
in the mid-Atlantic states. After Mr. Lazarus's departure,
Mr. Fisher will assume the duties of president and chief
operating officer until a successor is found, Jamesway said.
   In the year ended Feb. 3, Mr. Lazarus received cash
compensation of $552,590, compared with $569,357 for Mr.
Fisher, according to proxy material for the annual meeting
held June 4.
   "They've been a good team for a long time," Edward F.
Johnson, analyst at Prescott Ball &amp; Turben Inc. in New York,
said of Messrs. Fisher and Lazarus. Though not a strong
performer in recent years, Jamesway did stave off potentially
weaker performance in a highly competitive industry with many
troubled companies, Mr. Johnson said. But he added that
Jamesway might well do better with a new president.
   Jamesway's earnings declined in fiscal 1990 for the third
year in a row, despite higher sales. But the company said it
expects earnings in the current fiscal year, ending next Feb.
2, to exceed the $5.8 million, or 41 cents a share, earned on
sales of $855.1 million in fiscal 1990.
   Barry Rockland, senior vice president for finance, said
sales for stores open more than a year are expected to rise
this year, and expense control is tighter.
