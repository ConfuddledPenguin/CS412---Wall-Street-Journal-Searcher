   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said it could face a
fine of as much as $1 million following a conviction on
conspiracy and bribery charges related to the sale of Coke to
a U.S. Navy base.
   In February, the Justice Department issued an 11-count
indictment against a Coca-Cola bottling unit, Mid-Atlantic
Coca-Cola Bottling Co., on charges related to the sale of
soft drinks at the Navy operations base in Norfolk, Va. The
indictment also charged that illegal gratuities were paid to
a former civilian U.S. Navy procurement officer.

   Two weeks ago, a federal court in Norfolk found
Mid-Atlantic guilty of all 11 counts under the indictment. In
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Coca-Cola
Enterprises said it may appeal. Sentencing is set for Aug. 3.
   The indictment, covering sales in 1984 and 1985, also
named Michael A. Hedges, a former Mid-Atlantic area vice
president, sales, and James J. Valerio, a former Mid-Atlantic
area controller.
   Before the trial, Mr. Hedges pleaded guilty to two counts
of paying illegal gratuities, according to the SEC filing.
Mr. Valerio was acquitted of a charge of conspiracy, the
filing said. Mr. Hedges couldn't be reached for comment.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, a bottling business formed in 1986,
is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co. Coca-Cola acquired a
controlling interest in Mid-Atlantic in September 1984,
subsequently turning over its ownership of the business to
Coca-Cola Enterprises.
   Coca-Cola officials couldn't be reached for comment.
