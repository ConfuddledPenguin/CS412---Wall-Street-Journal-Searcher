   Knape &amp; Vogt Manufacturing Co. said it expects profit from
operations for the fourth quarter ending June 30 will
"approximate 40 cents to 45 cents a share," or $1.6 million
to $1.8 million, up from 37 cents a share, or $1.4 million, a
year earlier.
   The company, based in Grand Rapids, Mich., said it expects
to report a one-time gain of $1 a share, or $3.9 million, for
the quarter. The gain reflects profit from the sale of a
factory in La Mirada, Calif.

   The company said full-year earnings, before the gain,
should rise to $1.35 to $1.40 a share, or $5.3 million to
$5.5 million, from $1.31 a share, or $5.3 million, a year
ago. Sales are expected to rise about 8% and exceed $124
million, it said.
   Knape &amp; Vogt also said Allan E. Perry, 49 years old, was
named vice president, manufacturing, effective immediately.
Mr. Perry, formerly vice president and general manager of the
company's Modar subsidiary, succeeds Walter P. Knauss Jr.,
who left "to pursue other interests," the company said. Mr.
Perry also will take Mr. Knauss's seat on the board.
