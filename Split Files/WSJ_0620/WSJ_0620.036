   CINCINNATI -- Campeau Corp.'s retailing units, Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., reported net
losses for the first quarter that were little changed from a
year earlier, but the units said the losses were smaller than
expected.
   In their first report on quarterly earnings since filing
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy status in January, Federated said
it had a net loss of $57.6 million in the 13 weeks ended May
5, compared with $62.2 million a year earlier. Allied,
meantime, posted a net loss of $41.9 million, compared with
$40.3 million. The latest results included costs related to
the reorganization of Federated and Allied of $4.8 million
and $14.9 million, respectively.

   Factoring out the reorganization costs, Janet Mangano, a
retail analyst at Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York, said losses
narrowed from year-earlier levels, underlining her belief
that Federated and Allied will be profitable by the final
quarter of the year.
   Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Allied and
Federated, said in a statement that the latest results
"exceeded our expectations for how the business would perform
in the period immediately following the Chapter 11 filings."
   Sales figures also were better than company projections
made in April, when Federated and Allied said they expected
sales for the two units to dip 3% for the quarter. Instead,
combined sales were down just 0.5%.
   Federated alone reported sales of $1.01 billion, down from
$1.03 billion a year earlier. Allied's sales rose to $581.4
million from $572.5 million.
   The companies said the latest period's sales performance
came despite disruptions in receipts of merchandise early in
the quarter, when wholesalers held back shipments as the
companies readied their Chapter 11 filings. They said
shipments were back to normal by the end of the quarter and
sales trends were "strengthening."
   Net interest expenses declined in the latest period,
amounting to $93.5 million at Federated and $67.8 million at
Allied. This compared with year-earlier net interest expense
for Federated and Allied of $120.3 million and $67.8 million,
respectively.
   However, operating cash flow also was lower. Operating
cash flow, defined as earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and costs related to their
bankruptcy-law status, is regarded as the most accurate
measure of their business under Chapter 11.
   At Federated, operating cash flow declined to $62.6
million from $84.2 million. Allied had operating cash flow of
$34.3 million, down from $40.6 million.
   Ms. Mangano, the Josephthal analyst, said it wasn't
surprising that operating cash flow didn't cover interest
expenses, given that the first quarter is traditionally the
weakest for retailers.
   Federated also said it had $419 million in cash on hand as
of June 6, compared with $18.8 million a year earlier.
Allied's cash on hand amounted to $189 million, compared with
none.
