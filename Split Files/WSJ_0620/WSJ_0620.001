   Ames Department Stores Inc. reported a $429.1 million loss
for its fiscal first quarter, larger than some expectations
and a possible signal of further store closings and layoffs.
   The loss, equal to $11.56 a share, pushed Ames's book
value down to a negative $74.5 million. Book value, or total
assets minus liabilities, is a measure of a company's net
worth.

   A year ago, Ames reported a first quarter net loss of
$16.5 million, or 52 cents a share. Its book value then was a
positive $570 million.
   Sales in the quarter, ended April 28, fell to $934.8
million from $1.09 billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Ames closed
at $2.125, down 12.5 cents, on volume of 498,200 shares.
   The troubled discount retailer, operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy court protection, took charges of $347.5 million
in the latest quarter, mostly related to previously announced
store closings and anticipated future markdowns of inventory.
Earlier this month, Ames said it planned to cut 18,000 of its
50,000 employees and close 221 stores, leaving 458 open.
   Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., said the stores that
will stay open operated at about break-even in the first
quarter, on a pretax basis not including special charges,
interest or corporate overhead.
   Company officials said the surviving stores' performance
will be aided in the months ahead by clearance sales and
better-stocked shelves, resulting from financing secured
after the bankruptcy filing. But some creditors and analysts
expect more store closings after the summer.
   "The store closings and write-down of inventory represent
an important first step toward our objective of emerging from
Chapter 11," Steven L. Pistner, Ames's chief executive
officer, said in a prepared statement.
   Thomas Goldberg, an attorney for Ames's creditors, said "I
think it's pretty clear there will have to be a second round"
of closings. Ames has a number of stores "that are on
probation" because they are unprofitable now but may be
redeemable through the boosted sales Ames is aiming for, Mr.
Goldberg added. By September, he said, creditors would want
to look at store-by-store results to separate profitable
stores form unprofitable ones.
   "They may require further downsizing," said Edward Comeau,
an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, who said the
size of the quarterly loss surprised him. "They're taking the
right steps," Mr. Comeau added, but "it's still going to be a
long way out."
   Doug Ewing, an Ames spokesman, acknowledged that some of
the remaining 458 Ames stores "aren't making a contribution
to profit," but said they represented a small number.
"Management clearly has the motivation and responsibility to
monitor our stores and their performance and will be doing
that," Mr. Ewing added.
