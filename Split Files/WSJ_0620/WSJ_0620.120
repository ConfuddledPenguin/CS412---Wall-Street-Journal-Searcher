   Mercedes-Benz AG, Stuttgart, said sales of cars and trucks
grew firmly in the first five months of 1990, with world-wide
group sales increasing 10% from a year earlier to 24 billion
marks ($14.32 billion).
   But officials of the vehicle manufacturing arm of West
Germany's largest industrial group, Daimler-Benz AG, were
guarded about prospects for 1990 earnings growth.

   Mercedes Chairman Werner Niefer projected an increase in
group sales to 58 billion marks from 56.37 billion marks in
1989. Mercedes accounts for nearly three-quarters of
Daimler's global sales.
   In Europe, excluding West Germany, Mercedes boosted unit
sales 3% in the five months to an unspecified level, Mr.
Niefer said. In West Germany, unit sales rose slightly to
105,000 cars.
   The official said Mercedes-Benz sales in Japan were up 60%
from a year earlier, making the company Japan's largest
importer of foreign cars. Unit sales of cars in the U.S.
gained 5% in the five months. World-wide, the company sold
240,000 cars.
