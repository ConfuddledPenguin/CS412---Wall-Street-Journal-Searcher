   BONN -- West German exports are expected to rise 7.2% this
year, as demand for capital goods continues to be strong,
according to a survey by the Association of German Chambers
of Commerce and Industry of 45 commercial offices that
represent the country abroad.
   Export growth will slow from last year's 12.5% rate of
increase, the survey found, but the organization said this is
still good, in view of a general slowdown in world trade
growth. The continued rise in exports underlines the strong
position West German industry has managed to maintain
internationally, the association said.

   A regional breakdown shows that an 8.5% increase in
exports is likely to other member nations of the European
Community, which account for 72% of West Germany's total
shipments abroad. Exports to North America are expected to
drop 4.3% this year, after a 2.5% increase in 1989; the
reversal reflects the strength of the mark against the
dollar, which makes German exports relatively expensive.
