   NEW YORK -- Investor Peter B. Bedford nearly doubled his
stake in Amrep Corp., and he said he and management have
discussed possible board representation for him or a
designee.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in
Washington, Mr. Bedford, president of the Lafayette, Calif.,
real estate developer Bedford Properties Inc., disclosed that
his stake in Amrep jumped to 16.16% from 8.7%. Mr. Bedford
said in the filing that he acquired the holding as an
investment.

   Mr. Bedford now holds 1,070,020 Amrep common shares,
including 500,320 bought May 4 to June 15 for $7.375 to $7.50
each. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Amrep shares rose 12.5 cents to $7.75.
   Amrep, based here and led by Howard W. Friedman, chairman
and chief executive officer, is a real estate developer and
international magazine distributor. The company has 6.6
million shares outstanding.
   Mr. Friedman confirmed that discussions with Mr. Bedford
are under way. "We're pleased that the Bedford organization
recognizes the values" inherent in Amrep, the executive said.
   Recently, Kane-Miller Corp., a Tarrytown, N.Y., food
processor, disclosed to the SEC that it holds 8.1% of Amrep
and might seek control of the concern. In that filing,
Kane-Miller said it had talked with Amrep about gaining board
representation, but it said those discussions were
"uneventful."
   Neither a Kane-Miller spokesman nor Mr. Bedford was
available for comment.
