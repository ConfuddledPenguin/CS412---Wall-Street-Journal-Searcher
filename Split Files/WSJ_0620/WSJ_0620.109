   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. and music producer Quincy
Jones formed a joint venture for the development of
television, film and music projects. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Time Warner's strategic-development arm, Time Warner
Enterprises, will be the financial backer and a 50% owner of
Quincy Jones Entertainment Co. Time Warner Enterprises also
said it will "support" a second company, Quincy Jones
Broadcasting, which will buy television and radio stations.
The nature of that relationship couldn't be learned.
