   INGERSOLL-RAND Co. (Woodcliff Lake, N.J.) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it upgraded its rating on about $575
million of debt of this supplier of non-electrical machinery
and equipment. The rating concern raised its ratings on
senior unsecured and shelf-registration debt to single-A from
single-A-minus, and its commercial-paper rating to single-A-1
from single-A-2. It said the company is enjoying improved
profitability after subpar performance in the past economic
cycle. While demand for its products could weaken sharply,
"improved financial controls and balance-sheet support should
enable the company to weather any normal cyclical downturn,"
S&amp;P said.
