   By the time he saw the oncoming ship, it was too late.
   The pilot of a Panamanian-registered tanker was completing
a complicated turn into the cramped Houston Ship Channel last
summer when he saw heading toward him a tugboat pushing an
oil-filled barge.

   The pilot, Michael B. Gale, frantically radioed the
tugboat. "I can't, I can't stop this thing," he said.
   The tugboat operator, Mason T. Ware, responded: "I can't
stop now. Lord of Mercy, Skipper."
   Five seconds later, Mr. Ware cleared his throat and said,
"There ain't nothing I can do, Cap."
   The collision came 2 1/2 minutes later, as the Panamanian
ship, the Rachel B, plunged into the barge, ripping open a
hole through which 240,000 gallons of oil flowed into the
water near the Gulf of Mexico.
   As this and countless other incidents -- such as last
week's fire aboard the tanker Mega Borg -- illustrate, the
nation's system of transporting oil by tanker is a wreck. On
two out of every three days, on average, an oil tanker in
U.S. waters catches fire, explodes, collides with a dock or
another ship, breaks apart, experiences mechanical failure,
runs aground or winds up in some other kind of accident,
Coast Guard accident reports indicate.
   "This is the single most important issue we see right
now," says Admiral J. William Kime, the Coast Guard
commandant.
   Last week's Mega Borg incident could have become the
biggest spill in U.S. history. For four agonizing days last
week, fire roared from the 886-foot Norwegian supertanker.
Crippled, it settled lower and lower, threatening to dump a
staggering 38 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
   Then, slowly, firefighters won control. In the end, only
3.9 million gallons of crude leaked, and most of that burned
in the holocaust or evaporated in the searing Texas sun. An
environmental disaster had been averted. This time.
   "There are problems at all levels of the oil
transportation system, including the design and construction
of the ships, control of traffic in the harbors, the training
and competence of ship crews and the ability of the
regulators to oversee the whole operation," declares Peter
Johnson, senior associate of the Office of Technology
Assessment in Washington.
   What put the oil transport system on the rocks, experts
say, is a decade of corner-cutting driven by slumping
revenues. As crude-oil prices crashed from $40 a barrel in
1981 to as low as $10 five years later, the industry hacked
spending, reduced tanker crews and began to stretch
equipment. Excess capacity and collapsing revenues also
spurred independent tanker operators, who transport the bulk
of the nation's crude, to delay maintenance and repairs, and
to hire cheaper and fewer sailors.
   Things are likely to get worse, too. Now demand for oil
and tankers to move it is rebounding. Currently, an average
of 52 tankers a day deliver 462 million gallons of crude oil,
gasoline and other petroleum products to U.S. ports, up from
400 million gallons five years ago, the American Petroleum
Institute estimates. Because the U.S. is increasingly
dependent on foreign oil, both numbers are rising steadily.
   But the system is fatigued. Many ships are in poor shape,
crews inadequate and practices sloppy. Industry experts
expect accidents to increase right along with imports, and
possibly faster.
   Many new ships are designed and built with less steel,
which can make them more vulnerable than old ones. And some
government steps intended to prevent problems may have
actually made them worse.
   "The whole industry has changed and these people have to
modernize," insists Sen. Brock Adams, the Washington state
Democrat who is pushing various tanker-related legislation.
"You now have such a massive world-wide movement of oil you
have to treat it as dangerous."
   Industry officials don't wholly disagree. They too worry
about aging ships and human error by poorly qualified crews
and officers. "There is room for considerable improvement,"
concedes Tormod Rafgard, managing director of the
International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, a
trade group in Norway. "But it is exaggerated to say this is
an unsafe system; 99.99% of the oil is coming in without
problems. It is a good system."
   In fact, while definitive statistics on all tanker
troubles aren't available, the number of large spills (10,000
gallons or more) in the U.S. has held at six or seven a year
for a decade, says Richard Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil
Pollution Bulletin. But expectations of safety have risen
mightily, especially since the Exxon Valdez dumped nearly 11
million gallons of crude into cold Prince William Sound 15
months ago.
   "The boundary between acceptable and nonacceptable
accidents has changed," says Terje Staalstrom, a manager for
Oslo-based det Norske Veritas, a ship classification society.
   And during the '80s, the pressure to save money also
intensified. So upkeep of ships, new and old, has suffered.
"The majority of large tankers are out of date, over-age and
in many cases poorly maintained," Paul Slater, chairman of
the ship finance firm First International Financial Corp.,
told a tanker conference in California last week.
   A long period of depressed shipping rates that began in
the mid-1970s encouraged owners to postpone maintenance,
particularly on idled vessels. By 1985, a typical large
250,000-deadweight-ton tanker was fetching a spot charter
rate of around $5,000 a day. But the bare-bones cost to run
it was $6,000 to $7,000 a day, says George Blake, a director
of Overseas Shipholding Group.
   Even today's day rates for large tankers of close to
$30,000 are $10,000 below what's needed to justify replacing
an old ship with a new one, says the tanker-owner trade
group. So, says the group's Mr. Rafgard, while the "tanker
fleet is getting older, this problem certainly will not
disappear."
   Some of the ship classification societies that inspect
vessels before they can be insured now are cracking down. "We
deleted four ships in April due to overdue maintenance or
noncompliance with requirements, and we deleted 24 in March,"
says Mr. Staalstrom of det Norske Veritas. "I'm not afraid of
old ships. I'm afraid of a management that isn't taking care
of its ships," he says. "You have accidents."
   While the cause of the Mega Borg fire is still unknown, an
inquiry has turned up 14 pieces of equipment or parts of the
ship overdue for maintenance and inspections. In the pump
room, where the fire may have begun and traditionally one of
the most dangerous areas of a tanker, oil may have been
leaking from a gauge, according to testimony at an
investigatory hearing. The captain, C.M. Mahidhara, told the
panel the ship was operating with a cracked storage tank.
   New tankers ought to be less troublesome, but that may not
be so. In recent years, large tankers have been built with
10% less steel. Architects have tried to compensate for the
lighter weight with computer-aided design, high-strength
steel and improved coatings to protect the thinner metal from
cracking and corrosion.
   Some experts endorse such designs. "Before, we had to put
in more steel because we weren't quite sure how close to the
limit we were," says Garry Beaumont, chief ship surveyor of
Lloyd's Register of Shipping, a London-based
ship-classification society. But he concedes that
strong-but-thin steel "will age faster and use up its
corrosion resistance quicker," and he frets that the next
generation of tankers is being designed with even less steel.
   Some are outraged by use of thinner steel. Modern tankers
are "flimsy and have too narrow a margin for error," says
Arthur McKenzie, director of the Tanker Advisory Center in
New York and a former Exxon Corp. shipping executive. Lloyd
Bergeson, a retired naval architect, says modern tankers may
be "perfectly adequate in strength to withstand buffeting by
ocean waves, but when they hit the ground they don't have the
strength to withstand the impact."
   Mr. Bergeson labels the Exxon Valdez, launched in 1986, an
example of "a modern ship that has been cost-engineered too
far." Another naval architect contends that the Valdez and
Exxon Long Beach, its sister ship, have the least steel
weight for their size of any U.S. tanker.
   Exxon defends the Long Beach and the Valdez, saying the
Valdez hit Bligh Reef so hard that even a double hull like
those now urged in some quarters would have torn.
   In any case, an internal Coast Guard tanker study
commissioned after that spill reveals a "significant number
of failures in ships over 700 feet in length and less than 15
years old." In particular, tankers on Alaskan runs "were
experiencing a significant number of serious structural
failures" that had frequently resulted "in significant loss
of cargo," the study says.
   Quality of construction in newer vessels is also a
problem, the Coast Guard says, so it is increasing
inspections of some U.S. tankers. "We found that the
workmanship in the shipyards with high-tensile steel was not
as good," says Adm. Joel D. Sipes, chief of the agency's
Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental
Protection. He says shipbuilders have difficulty welding the
material, and often internal framework is improperly
designed.
   Three months before the Exxon Valdez spill, oil was
discovered leaking one night from a tanker called the
Thompson Pass while it was loading crude at the Port of
Valdez. Some 71,000 gallons spilled, most of which was
recovered. Divers discovered three long fractures in the
ship's bottom plating, according to an Alaskan
water-pollution report. It concluded that fractures in the
Thompson Pass, built in 1978, were "most probably a result of
original construction heat-treatment procedures, plus nine
years of North Pacific operations."
   Says William Lockwood, president of Interocean Management
Corp. of Philadelphia, manager of the ship: "We have had a
problem with the design and have taken steps to correct it"
by adding structural members to alleviate stresses.
   Another big problem with tanker transport is that many
vessels now operate with a third less personnel than a decade
ago. "We have seen a dramatic decline in the size of crews,
and critical tasks are falling to a very few number of
people," says John Bobb, of the Maritime Institute of
Technology Graduate Studies, which trains officers in
Linthicum Heights, Md. "Fatigue is beginning to take its
toll," he says.
   In its report following the Exxon Valdez spill, the Coast
Guard devotes an entire section to oil-tanker crew fatigue
and manning problems. Sixteen-hour work days are common, it
says. Coast Guard inspectors tell of talking to chief mates
immediately after their arrival in port to set up inspection
schedules. "Some mates were so exhausted that they fell
asleep during these meetings," the report says.
   Aboard the Union Oil Co. tanker Coast Range, "a lot of
machinery is not taken care of because we have no time," says
boatswain George Lua. "There aren't enough people. There's
just too much work." The ship, which makes frequent stops
between Puget Sound and Los Angeles, "is in and out of port
so much that we are too busy hooking up hoses and tying up
the ship, docking and undocking," to do regular maintenance,
Mr. Lua says.
   A Unocal spokesman dismisses Mr. Lua's grievances as a
"standard seaman's complaint." The spokesman says, "You'll
get that comment from any seaman that there isn't enough time
to do the work." He says the Coast Range is a modern,
well-maintained, double-bottom tanker.
   A short-handed and exhausted crew on the Greek tanker
World Prodigy contributed to the spill last June of 290,000
gallons of oil into Narragansett Bay, according to a suit
filed against the ship's owners by Rhode Island. The weather
was clear and the seas tranquil that afternoon. But Captain
Iakovas Georgoudis had been working almost nonstop for a full
day and a half before the ship hit a reef, he told a National
Transportation Safety Board hearing.
   Then the half-hour preceding the accident turned hectic.
   The World Prodigy was informed it would unload at two
ports instead of one. As the tanker approached the
hard-to-navigate shoreline, the captain testified, the chief
officer went below to calculate what the ship's new distance
from the ocean floor would be following the discharge of some
of its cargo. As the only officer on the bridge, the captain
became lookout and navigator. He had to make sure his orders
were carried out, and he had to plot positions on navigation
charts. When the chief officer returned with incorrect
calculations, the captain started redoing the math himself.
As a local harbor pilot was about to board, the World Prodigy
hit a reef.
   Thomas H. Walsh Jr., an attorney for the World Prodigy
(which is managed by International Maritime Agencies Co. of
Athens), argues that the ship had the full complement of
seamen required for vessels flying the Greek flag. The
captain, he maintains, wasn't fatigued because he had been
able to take naps on a cot on the bridge. The suit is
pending.
   Tankers face some of their biggest risks pulling in and
out of port, since the ports themselves have changed little
while ships have grown. Some lanes in the Houston Ship
Channel, connecting the city's port to the Gulf of Mexico 50
miles away, are so tight that when two vessels approach each
other, one has to give way and risk grounding along the side.
Local seamen call the process "Texas Chicken."
   Last summer's Rachel B incident in the channel occurred
when the Rachel B was trying to avoid a jutting sandbank. Had
the channel been dredged, "this accident most probably would
not have happened," the Coast Guard says.
   Giant tankers too big to come into most ports pose other
problems. They anchor at sea and pump their cargo into
smaller vessels that can dock. The practice, called
"lightering," is what the Mega Borg was doing when it
exploded. The oil industry estimates giant oceangoing tankers
lighter between 42 million gallons and 63 million of crude
daily off the U.S. coastline, and the amount is increasing as
imports rise. Lightering entails risks of a collision in
addition to pump, hose or other problems that could cause a
spill. Shipping executives insist there's little hazard.
   Dave Caldow, Chevron Corp.'s assistant fleet manager and a
former captain of a vessel lightering between the Gulf of
Mexico and a port in Pascagoula, Miss., says all 16 years the
company has operated there have been incident-free.
   As was the case with the Mega Borg, most lightering occurs
beyond the 12-mile limit of U.S. waters, which basically puts
any foreign-flagged vessels involved beyond the reach of U.S.
law. "You don't have the Coast Guard on top of you," says
Gary Gehring, an instructor at the U.S. Merchant Marine
Academy in New York.
   Even in the U.S., much of the oversight -- that pertaining
to construction and maintenance -- is in the hands of
classification societies, which are paid by ship owners to
prove their vessels are worthy of insurance. But the
credibility of these organizations is under attack.
   They've become "immersed in a bitter competitive battle to
class ships," says Harry Keefe, chairman of the American
Institute of Marine Underwriters. "This has had a big impact
on their effectiveness. Some ship owners want to go with the
society that will cost them the least." Now some Scandinavian
insurance underwriters are establishing their own corps of
ship inspectors to avoid reliance on the societies.
   Foreign tankers that never enter U.S. waters need no
insurance for oil spills. If they cross the territorial
boundary they must post bond with the Coast Guard based on
their size, but it's a minimum. For instance, though it had
some $700 million of insurance, the Mega Borg legally had to
have just $10.3 million, insufficient for a major cleanup.
   Current law puts all the liability on the tanker owner,
not on the owner of the oil it's carrying. Congress is
considering whether also to make the owner of the oil
partially liable.
   Congress is also considering raising minimum liability
insurance levels and setting maximums, a move opposed by many
in the oil industry. "As you continue to raise liability
requirements and punishments, you're going to have good
operators say it's not worth putting myself in jeopardy,"
says Jerry Aspland, president of Atlantic Richfield Co.'s
marine subsidiary.
   ARCO plans to stop transporting other companies' oil on
its tankers through Cook Inlet, Alaska, because of spill
liability fears. And already, one of the world's largest oil
companies, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is curbing the number of
its ships in U.S. waters and will hire more independents
instead.
   The most controversial solution has been the push for
double hulls. Proponents argue that by adding a second,
protective hull on the bottom and sides of a tanker, spills
from groundings and collisions might be reduced.
   Critics -- and there are many among oil executives -- say
any extra protection isn't worth the expense, though it's
unclear what that would be. Some advocates say a double hull
adds 5% and 8% to the cost of a new $90 million tanker built
in a Far Eastern shipyard. But others advocate designs that
could raise costs as much as 25%. Opponents also argue that
double-hulled tankers face a greater risk of losing bouyancy
after a severe grounding, complicating salvage efforts.
   Some propose more offshore unloading facilities like the
giant Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, a platform 19 miles off
the coast but designated by law as a U.S. port. Tankers
unload about 42 million gallons of crude a day that moves to
shore via pipeline. Built by five oil companies for about
$800 million, the facility says it has had no major spill in
its eight years of operation. Advocates say if there were
one, it would be a long way from beaches.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. says it and other companies are
looking at the idea of building such a port off Texas. Cost
estimates range from $500 million to $1 billion. That's
substantially less, proponents note, than the more than $2
billion Exxon has spent so far for its Alaskan cleanup.

           The Perils of Transporting Oil by Sea
                                                                                                       

   Among the most common problems and mishaps facing oil
tankers:
                                                                                                       

   -- Fires and Explosion. These can happen at almost any
stage of a tanker's journey but are most likely when the
tanks are empty (the ballast voyage). Fumes trapped in the
tanks are ignited by sparks generated by the cleaning
process. Vapors can also build up in the pump room, which may
have been the case in the Mega Borg spill.
                                                                                                       

   -- Collisions at the entrance to or in ports. In the
collision of the Phillips Oklahoma and another ship in the
River Humber, England, in September 1989, its side tanks were
penetrated and it lost 750 tons of crude oil.
                                                                                                       

   -- Breakups in heavy weather. In 1988-89 three tankers --
the Athenian Venture, carrying 30,000 tons of products, the
Odyssey, carrying 130,000 tons of oil, and the Maasguar,
carrying 30,000 tons of chemicals -- all sank fully loaded,
with the loss of all 79 crew members.
                                                                                                       

   -- Running Aground while entering or leaving ports. This
has caused many spills including the disastrous Exxon Valdez
spill in March 1989.
                                                                                                       

   -- Overflows while loading or discharging oil. In August
1989 the Minerva over-filled tanks and discharged 2 tons of
crude into the Delaware River.
                                                                                                       

   -- Hull Cracks, especially on large American tankers
making the Alaska run. In January 1989 the hull of the Cove
Leader cracked while loading in Alaska, spilling 10 tons of
crude.
                                                                                                       

   -- Poor Maintenance and poor design. These may have
contributed to the loss of a plate on the Pacificos, which
spilled 10,000 tons of oil off the coast of Africa in October
1989.
                                                                                                       

   -- Contact Damage. Hitting the dock or another ship can
rupture the hull. In 1989 the Stolt Sea was hit while moored
at Avondale, La., on the Mississippi River, losing 200 tons
of bunker fuel oil.
