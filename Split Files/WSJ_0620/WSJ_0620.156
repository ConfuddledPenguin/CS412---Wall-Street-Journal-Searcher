   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Corona Corp.'s plan to
secure control of Canada's hottest gold prospect -- the big
Eskay Creek gold deposit in northwestern British Columbia --
has hit a couple of major roadblocks.
   Placer Dome Inc., a big, cash-rich gold producer that is
competing with Corona to acquire Stikine Resources Ltd.,
half-owner of the Eskay Creek deposit, is expected today to
announce that about 40% of Stikine's 3,330,000 shares were
tendered under Placer Dome's offer, which expired yesterday.

   A spokesman for Placer Dome said final results of its
225.1 million Canadian dollar (US$191.7 million) or
C$67.50-a-share tender offer for Stikine won't be released
until this morning. But insiders familiar with the bid said
Placer Dome is expected to wind up with about 40% of the
company.
   As a result, Placer Dome will be in a position to thwart a
previously proposed plan under which Corona hoped to secure
control of Stikine through a stock swap and then merge
Stikine and Stikine's Eskay Creek partner, Prime Resources
Group Inc., with a newly created unit, Corona Gold Corp. The
plan requires approval by 75% of Stikine's holders.
   Separately, Corona confirmed that a proposed private
transaction under which it planned to immediately raise its
stake in Prime to 45% from 20% didn't close as scheduled
Friday. Corona's spokesman said the proposed purchase of 10.2
million Prime shares for an equal number of Corona Class A
shares from a group including Prime Chairman Murray Pezim,
associate Arthur Clemiss and Vancouver financier Jim Pattison
is only awaiting regulatory clearance.
   But Mr. Pezim disagreed, citing dissatisfaction with the
terms of the transaction, partly over the decline in Corona's
share price.
