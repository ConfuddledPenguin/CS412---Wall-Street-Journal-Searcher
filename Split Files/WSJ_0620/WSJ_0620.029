   Ask Scott McNealy, the chairman of fast-growing Sun
Microsystems Inc., who his competitors are, and he names
Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and
International Business Machines Corp.
   What about NCR Corp., the fifth-largest U.S. computer
maker and twice Sun's size? "We never see them," he says.

   NCR, founded in 1884 as National Cash Register Co., is
easy to miss. Based in blue-collar Dayton, Ohio -- light
years from the glitz of California's Silicon Valley -- NCR
dominates the slow-growing banking and retail-automation
markets but remains an also-ran in computers.
   "This is the invisible computer company," says George
Colony, the president of Forrester Research Inc., a
consulting firm. "It's an old-line, quiet, conservative
company that wants desperately to change that."
   So NCR is reinventing itself -- again. Last time, when it
made the wrenching change from mechanical to electronic cash
registers and computers in the 1970s, NCR shed tens of
thousands of workers, retooled its sprawling, obsolete
factories and invested heavily in new technology. Now, NCR is
shifting its strategy to keep up with the dizzying pace of
technological change in the 1990s.
   "I've been in this business 36 years, I've learned a lot
-- and most of it doesn't apply anymore," says Charles E.
Exley, chairman and chief executive.
   NCR's effort to spark new growth shows how tough it is for
old-line companies to hit the technological fast track.
Analysts say NCR was one of the first computer makers to
learn the hard lessons of a slower growing, more competitive
sales environment. It trimmed its work force and tightened
its inventories even as it expanded its market share in
profitable niches, often at the expense of much larger
competitors. In automatic teller machines, for example, NCR
vaulted past IBM last year to become the global market
leader.
   It wasn't enough. NCR's annual sales hit a plateau at $6
billion and have stayed there since 1988. Earnings fell 15%
in the 1990 first quarter after having been essentially flat
at about $420 million a year for three years. "We saw the big
opportunities in the 1980s, but we never really got our hands
on them," Mr. Exley says. Competitors joke that NCR hasn't
had a true technological innovation since its founder put a
bell on cash-register drawers to stem pilferage.
   Now, in the 1990s, another big opportunity is unfolding:
for fast, low-cost computers based on standard chip designs
and using standard software. This time, Mr. Exley is
determined to catch the wave. With a fervor unmatched by the
other old-line computer makers, he has recast the whole
company around the new standards. He has struck alliances
with small, fast-moving companies with hot technologies, is
spending lavishly on advertising and is pouring more money
than ever into research. He has shaken up NCR's strait-laced
executive ranks. And he has hired an outsider, a 38-year-old
California computer whiz named Philip M. Neches, as chief
scientist, senior vice president and a member of the
executive committee.
   Mr. Neches, who got the key job of breathing new life into
the company's research, seems somewhat out of place in the
staid senior ranks of NCR. But the importance of his role as
a catalyst for innovation was underscored on his first day on
the job early last year: When moving into his office, he
noticed a small brass plaque on his desk, identifying it as
belonging to NCR's founder, the renowned 19th-century
industrialist John Patterson. "There was a message there," he
says. "Now, I just have to live up to the furniture."
   NCR's efforts have begun to pay off. Last month, it
unveiled what is being hailed as the fastest personal
computer on the market, designed around Intel Corp.'s
top-of-the-line 80486 chip. PC Week says the computer turned
in the best overall performance of its class in recent tests;
ByteWeek, another industry publication, says the new PC shows
that NCR "has transformed itself in the last year from just
another PC cloner to a rising star in high-end systems." And
David Evans, vice president for information systems at J.C.
Penney Co., says, "Pound for pound, it's going to be
competitive with anything on the market."
   NCR's nascent PC business got a big boost when
Businessland Inc., the largest PC retailer, started selling
NCR machines last November, giving it coveted shelf space in
the critical retail-sales channel. But the prize lost some of
its luster when Compaq Computer Corp., a smaller, nimbler
competitor, returned to Businessland's shelves to compete
with NCR after Compaq and Businessland resolved a spat over
product direction and profit margins.
   NCR also is developing new designs, using standard chips,
at the highest reaches of computing power. It bought an
equity stake in and formed a joint venture with Teradata
Corp., a fast-growing California computer maker, with the
goal of building huge computers out of hundreds of standard
chips. Computer designers say this so-called massively
parallel approach could, for many tasks, achieve much the
same performance as IBM mainframes at sharply lower cost.
   The Teradata venture should close a costly gap in NCR's
product line and stanch a hemorrhage of sales as customers
demand more power. Beginning about three years ago, for
example, Lego Systems Inc., an Enfield, Conn., toy maker,
dropped NCR computers when its needs outpaced the technology
that NCR could deliver. It now uses Digital machines
throughout its operation, says David Krall, director of
information systems.
   Another NCR shortcoming, current and former customers say,
was the lack of software such as accounting or order-entry
packages for NCR's proprietary-design computers. "Software
has been NCR's weakest area," says Jon Linden, a senior vice
president at Ritter Food Corp., of Elizabeth, N.J., who uses
both NCR and Digital systems.
   NCR's customers say standard systems will make hundreds of
additional software packages available to them. And although
NCR says it will continue full support for buyers of its
proprietary-design computers, it has emphasized that its
future lies with what it calls its "open, cooperative
computing" approach and such standards as Microsoft Corp.'s
DOS and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix.
   NCR isn't the only big computer maker to embrace open
standards, which have become something akin to motherhood in
the industry. But some analysts say NCR might have more
credibility than its competitors with customers, who are
often suspicious of computer makers, such as Digital and IBM,
that still depend on sales of proprietary-design computers
for most of their profits. After all, NCR was the first big
computer maker to embrace Unix in commercial systems, back in
1981.
   There's another, less flattering reason why NCR's
commitment to standards might increase its credibility with
skeptical customers: Its proprietary lines aren't going
anywhere. They now account for about $900 million, or some
14%, of sales. "It's essentially a dying product line,"
Ritter Food's Mr. Linden says. But he isn't much worried
about his investment. "NCR is going to standards, and we are,
too."
   For major computer makers, proprietary systems can be both
cash cow and curse, says Peter Labe, an analyst at Labe,
Simpson &amp; Co., a New York securities firm. As standards
spread from the desktop to larger, commercial-strength
machines, he says, "proprietary computers will begin to be
seen as an anchor around the necks of the big companies."
Steven Milunovich, a First Boston Corp. analyst, says NCR's
weakness in proprietary computers "could actually turn into
an advantage."
   But there are profound risks, too, in the shift to
standards. Because customers are freed from dependence on a
single company's computer design, they are far more likely to
buy from the lowest-cost producer. David Carlson, senior vice
president at K mart Corp., applauds NCR's new strategy as
"bold and visionary." But in a recent competitive bid for
2,500 personal computers, Mr. Carlson turned to Unisys Corp.
"NCR was a finalist, but Unisys offered us slightly better
price performance at the time," he says.
   Mr. Exley insists that NCR will be price-competitive with
high-end rivals such as IBM and Compaq but won't try to sell
computers at bargain-basement prices. He contends that
superior engineering and world-wide service and support will
win customers for whom price alone isn't decisive. And NCR's
track record in banking and retail businesses will give it a
running start, he says.
   Investors shouldn't expect NCR's more aggressive strategy
to pay off right away. Nonetheless, the stock has performed
well and is up about 15% since January, buoyed by wave after
wave of buy-backs. Takeover rumors circulating last year have
died out.
   Mr. Exley concedes that NCR's revenue and earnings "are
likely to bounce around a bit" and that growth will stay in
single digits this year. Meanwhile, NCR's strong service
business and such low-tech sidelines as business forms will
continue to provide the bulk of operating profits. But he
says that the workstation and PC division broke into the
black last month and will be profitable for the year, and
that international sales, especially in Japan, remain strong.
   The biggest challenge from within, current and former
executives say, is getting the sales force to deliver. "NCR
is an enormous organization, and it isn't going to change
overnight," says Ronald Stanczak, a former executive. "Can
they get everyone marching the same way at the same time?
That's the real question."
   It's all uncharted territory. "We're a 106-year-old, $6
billion startup," says Mr. Neches, the chief scientist.
   Gilbert Williamson, NCR's president, adds: "You have to be
the one to obsolete your own technology, or someone else will
do it for you. NCR has had to learn that lesson more than
once -- and we don't plan to go through it again."
