   LONDON -- British Steel PLC said it agreed to acquire the
Mannstaedt steelmaking unit of Klockner Werke AG of West
Germany for 300 million marks ($179.9 million), boosting the
U.K. steelmaker's effort to diversify from its domestic
market.
   The proposed acquisition, under negotiation since January,
will supplement British Steel's strategy to produce
higher-margin products and steer away from lower-margin
commodity products. It also will lessen British Steel's
reliance on its glutted home market, which accounts for 64%
of annual sales.

   Executives at British Steel, which has rebounded to
profitability from heavy losses several years ago, said they
are continuing to look for possible acquisitions in the U.S.
and Continental Europe. British Steel, which the government
sold to private investors in 1988, could tap as much as #2
billion ($3.43 billion), including #500 million in cash, for
acquisitions. In a recent interview, British Steel's
chairman, Sir Robert Scholey, said, "Our radar is operating
on all" steelmakers, though he declined to identify any
targets.
   Separately, company officials said Monday's U.S. Supreme
Court decision that may require Dallas-based LTV Corp. to
reassume liability for more than $2 billion in recently
unfunded pensions won't discourage British Steel from
prospecting for U.S. acquisitions. The decision could tarnish
the allure of some U.S. targets.
   Klockner's Mannstaedt division, based near Cologne,
produces about 200,000 tons a year of hot-rolled special
sections of steel and about 120,000 tons a year of hollow and
cold-formed sections from hot-rolled steel coil. Two units
that fabricate mining arches are included in the planned
purchase by British Steel.
