   NEW YORK -- New York City's largest public employee
pension fund said it sold shares valued at $563 million to
complete its divestment of stock in companies doing business
in South Africa.
   The $17.6-billion New York City Employees Retirement
System said the shares in 31 companies were sold in the final
phase of the divestment program begun in 1984. Shares valued
at $262 million in 44 companies with South Africa ties had
been sold earlier.

   The divestment program applied to almost 90% of the
system's $8.6 billion in stocks invested "passively" in an
index fund. A spokeswoman said the pension system's trustees
haven't decided if the South Africa divestiture retirement
should also apply to the $895 million in shares invested by
so-called active money managers.
   The public employee fund is the only one of New York
City's five pension systems to complete a South
Africa-related divestment program. The other city funds
either don't invest in stocks or have approved divestment
programs without implementing them.
