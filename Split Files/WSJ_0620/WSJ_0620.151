   Northwest Airlines' parent, NWA Inc., as expected, named
Frederick B. Rentschler president and chief executive
officer.
   Mr. Rentschler served as president and chief executive of
Beatrice Cos., a Chicago food concern, for the past three
years. Beatrice entered into a merger agreement with ConAgra
Inc., a Lincoln, Neb., food conglomerate, two weeks ago.

   Mr. Rentschler, 50 years old, succeeds Frederic V. Malek,
a member of the investor group led by NWA's chairman, Alfred
A. Checchi, that acquired NWA last year. Mr. Malek, an
adviser to President Bush and the former president of
Marriott Corp.'s hotel business, said he will continue to
oversee Northwest's customer service and employee-relations
programs as NWA's vice chairman.
   Mr. Malek said his outside commitments, including
organizing the 1990 economic summit for President Bush, made
it increasingly difficult for him to supervise Northwest's
day-to-day operations.
   Mr. Rentschler, who has no previous airline experience,
comes aboard at a critical time for the nation's fourth
largest airline. The carrier needs to pay $2.1 billion in
debt resulting from the Checchi group's $3.65 billion buy-out
last year, it is expanding domestically and in Europe, and it
is overhauling its food service, its aircraft interiors and
its employee-training programs.
