   FOOTHILL GROUP Inc., Los Angeles, said its Foothill
Capital Corp. unit completed a $50 million private placement
of senior notes, together with a related $50 million in
interest rate swap agreements designed to make the company's
interest obligations vary with market rates. Foothill, a
commercial lending and leasing concern, said the notes
consist of $15 million of 10.18% senior notes, due June 1993;
$15 million of 10.23% senior notes, due December 1993; $5
million of 10.27% senior notes, due June 1994; and $15
million of 10.35% senior notes, due June 1995. As a result of
the interest rate swap agreements, the company will pay a
variable interest rate tied to commercial paper rates.
Proceeds from the placement will be used to repay short-term
debt.
