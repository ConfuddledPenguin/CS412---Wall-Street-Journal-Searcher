   In regard to Gene I. Maeroff's May 21 editorial-page
article, "Three Missing Keys to Public-School Reform":
Perhaps Mr. Maeroff has been addressing too many "major
value-laden obstacles to improvement." Certainly something is
wrong with his priorities.
   He is upset because a National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) survey indicates one out of five 11th-graders
do no homework. But neither Mr. Maeroff nor his fellow
fellows at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching are seemingly disturbed about NAEP reading scores
showing three out of five 11th-graders cannot read well
enough to do homework or schoolwork at the high-school level.

   Mr. Maeroff thinks high-school students avoid tough
subjects such as physics and college algebra because they are
lazy, their parents are unsupportive and "peer pressure
denigrates scholarship." I think they don't take these
subjects because they can't read physics books and can't add,
subtract, multiply or divide fractions.
   In 1983, five million Soviet secondary students were
taking calculus. In 1986, five million U.S. high-school
students did not know that 87% of 10 is smaller than 10.
   More than 36% of our fourth-graders can't read, 40% of
seventh-graders can't read seventh-grade lessons written at
fourth- and fifth-grade levels. And 61% of the 11th-graders
can't read and understand ninth-grade lessons written at
sixth- and seventh-grade levels.
   Literacy is the missing key to U.S. public-school
education. And it has been missing for a very long time --
since the 1930s and 1940s when phonics teachers, who taught
children to read by matching sounds with letters that spell
sounds, began being replaced by "see and say" instructors,
who taught them to sight whole words by seeing them printed
over and over again. Nothing else explains the dreadful
disparity in the following sets of numbers and percentages:
   -- Only three to four out of 100 of the 18 million men
tested for military duty during World War II (1939-1945)
could not read.
   -- Seventeen out of 100 prospective recruits between ages
18 and 23 were rejected for illiteracy during the Korean War
(1950-1953).
   -- Three million Americans over 25 could not read in 1930,
1940 and 1950.
   -- Thirty million to 40 million American adults cannot
make sense out of a printed page today.
   Obviously, teaching all normal children to read in the
first two grades, just as we did before the introduction of
"see and say" instruction (most World War II nonreaders had
never been to school), should be first on a school-reform
agenda. Then see what else needs to be done.

   While many school districts across the country can
justifiably claim the need for increased funding, too much
emphasis has been placed on both revenue and reform.
   As a part-time teacher and tutor in the public-school
system and the father of three teen-agers, I believe Mr.
Maeroff's contention that there are two other "Rs" left out
of our debates is absolutely correct. Responsibility and
Respect for education and educators on the part of both the
student and the parent is the exception, not the rule, in
most schools today. What can come from academically sound
plans (reform) and increased funding (revenue) if the primary
recipient (student) lacks respect for the disseminator
(teacher) and the institution (school)? Furthermore, how will
the educational process improve if the primary authority
figure (parent) has not assumed the responsibility of
educational reinforcer?
   Placement of blame has yet to solve a problem. Before we
as adults, parents and business people begin "pointing the
finger of blame," let's make sure we have done all we can to
improve our own educational domain at home. Reform and
Revenue should always take a back seat to Respect and
Responsibility. Until they do, comparative educational
statistics will continue to show the U.S. in a poor light.

   Mr. Maeroff has put his finger on what is needed in U.S.
education today. Until scholastic achievement is more highly
valued than athletics and other extracurricular activities by
students and parents alike, all other prescriptions for the
ills of public education will continue to treat the symptoms
and not the disease.
   Fifty years ago, Marquette University sponsored an annual
competition in math proficiency for Milwaukee high-school
seniors. The top 10 in the written exams received modest cash
scholarship awards, but the real incentive for high-school
math departments was to place as many students as possible in
the top 10.
   I attended Milwaukee's Riverside High, where math teachers
searched out promising competitors with as much zeal as the
basketball coach sought out talent for a winning team.
Riverside High consistently had more winners than other
schools, attributable largely to the hard work of dedicated
math teachers who trained their proteges with as much
intensity as the best athletic coach.
