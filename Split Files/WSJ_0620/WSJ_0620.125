   NEW YORK -- The first leg of a court-ordered sale of the
art and coin collections of William Herbert Hunt and Nelson
Bunker Hunt met with considerable success last night.
   At Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s New York auction house, there
was brisk demand for the one-time Dallas billionaire
brothers' collections of Greek and Roman antiquities. Bidding
for the roughly 2,000-year-old marble statues, bronzes and
vases came from private collectors and museums, and many of
the pieces sold for double their pre-sale estimated prices.

   The total for the sale was $11.4 million. Sotheby's had
expected it to fetch $5 million to $7 million.
   It was good news for the Hunt brothers, whose businesses
are now in bankruptcy proceedings. In an unusual arrangement
with the bankruptcy trustees and creditors, the brothers
stood to gain if the sales were a success.
   If the total raised exceeds a certain amount yet to be
determined by the court, the Hunts will receive a portion of
the remainder as compensation, according to R. Carter Pate,
trustee for the Nelson Bunker Hunt liquidating trust. The
brothers spent time helping to sell the collection through
interviews and at receptions Sotheby's has hosted worldwide.
   All told, Sotheby's estimates that the three-day series of
sales will fetch about $20 million.
