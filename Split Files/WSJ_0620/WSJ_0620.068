   NEW YORK -- Cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. is taking
the unusual step of proposing that its cable systems become
affiliates of National Broadcasting Co.'s top-rated NBC
network in rural cities not served by broadcasters.
   John Malone, president of Tele-Communications, made the
proposal in a two-page letter to NBC President Robert C.
Wright. Mr. Wright couldn't be reached for comment, and NBC
officials said they haven't seen the letter, but they
indicated that the General Electric Co. unit wouldn't be
receptive to cable concern's overture.

   The proposal is also likely to infuriate the more than 200
broadcast TV stations that make up NBC's affiliate network.
"I can see no circumstance where such an arrangement would be
attractive or acceptable to any NBC affiliate," said the
affiliate board chairman, Eric Bremner, who heads
broadcasting operations at KING Broadcasting Co.
   The proposal is a fairly radical one in an industry where
cable systems have never had any relationship with the three
networks other than to provide reception for the local
broadcast affiliate. A cable system has never served as the
direct carrier of network TV programs.
   The timing of the proposal isn't accidental, said
Tele-Communications Vice-President Robert Thomson. NBC is
lobbying Capitol Hill to pass federal legislation that would
prohibit cable companies from signing exclusive agreements
with cable networks.
   Currently, a cable network signs a contract that gives
cable systems the right to broadcast the network in assigned
areas. For example, two cable companies in the Seattle region
have the right to broadcast TNT, the all-movie cable channel
owned by Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   NBC, which plans to operate a direct-to-home satellite TV
business dubbed Sky Cable with three partners by the end of
1993, wants the right to carry cable channels on its new
system, including those with existing exclusive distribution
agreements.
   Tele-Communications stressed, however, that it isn't
looking to compete with NBC affiliates. In his letter, Mr.
Malone asked for permission "to receive for retransmission on
its cable systems a direct network feed of all NBC network
programming in all its cable systems that do not have an
existing local network affiliate."
   For example, Tele-Communications operates a cable system
in Carson City, Nev., which has no local NBC affiliate.
TeleCommunications retransmits a distant signal from the Reno
NBC affiliate, which provides no local programming or news
about Carson City. But even if Tele-Communications became the
Carson City affiliate, it would continue to carry the Reno
NBC station, according to Tele-Communications' Mr. Thomson.
   Mr. Thomson said in a telephone interview that there are
"hundreds" of such cities that do not have local programming.
And in his letter to NBC's Mr. Wright, Mr. Malone said, "I
believe that TCI and NBC can work together to . . . provide
hometown television programming for a number of rural
communities across the United States which do not have it
now."
   Tele-Communications' Mr. Thomson said his company
approached NBC because "it is the most effective and most
popular programmer in the world, and they have indicated they
are cable-friendly." Of the three major broadcast networks,
NBC has been the most aggressive in pursuing cable
opportunities. Two years ago, it formed a programming joint
venture with Cablevision Systems Corp. to produce a wide
variety of entertainmnent, news and sports programming for
cable systems.
   Among the program ventures with Cablevision is the
Consumer News and Business Channel, or CNBC, which is
received by 16 million cable subscribers. NBC and Cablevision
also formed a joint venture earlier this year with News Corp.
and Hughes Communications, a unit of General Motors Corp., to
launch the direct-to-home satellite TV service, Sky Cable.
   But a move such as that proposed by Tele-Communications
could put NBC at loggerheads with its affiliates. Even if
Tele-Communications promises to continue to carry affiliates
that are currently imported from distant cities, affiliates
worry that the cable company will eventually drop that NBC
affiliate. In recent years, cable companies have been allowed
by law to drop any station that duplicates programming
provided by another, such as a distant-city affiliate of a
network.
   In his letter, Mr. Malone addressed that concern, saying
that "NBC network programming might conceivably appear on
more than one cable channel." He also said that his company
"would relinquish its `affiliate status,' following proper
notice and subject to certain conditions, in any community
where a new or existing broadcaster within the community was
selected as an NBC broadcast affiliate."
   Moreover, he said that while his company would carry NBC
on the same terms and conditions as those of NBC's broadcast
affiliates, Tele-Communications wouldn't ask NBC for
affiliate payments.
   But Mr. Malone added that any agreement with NBC would
have to be "phased in over time as NBC's existing, regionally
exclusive affiliation agreements lapse." Such agreements must
be renewed every two to three years, and affiliates worry
that NBC might not renew such pacts if a cable system becomes
an affiliate -- particularly if the cable system doesn't
charge the network for carrying it.
   NBC stressed it won't make any moves that might harm
affiliates. "We would not do anything that was not
advantageous to our affiliates," said an NBC spokesman.
   In his letter to Mr. Wright, Mr. Malone noted that many
rural cities and towns don't receive any local news, because
they are reliant on stations imported from other cities,
"which are naturally inclined to give events happening in
their city of license overwhelming priority." Such
communities "would be better served if they had their own
local NBC broadcast affiliates, but the economic reality is
that smaller communities often cannot support a broadcast
television station, let alone a full service broadcast
network affiliate."
   For cable, Mr. Malone noted, "the economics are
different." Cable systems get revenue from both advertisers
and subscriber fees, and "we have a growing ad sales capacity
even in our smallest service areas," he said.
