   It looks as if freshman Congressman Chuck Douglas of New
Hampshire is on his way to lifting one of the great veils of
secrecy that envelops political behavior in Washington. This
one allows House Members the hypocritical luxury of
co-sponsoring popular bills and then letting them languish or
die in unfriendly committees. Last month, he simply said that
on June 15 he would reveal the names of those Members who
backed Texas Democrat Charles Stenholm's balanced-budget
amendment to the Constitution but refused to sign the
necessary discharge petition to permit a floor vote. Though
several Members pressured Rep. Douglas to back down, they
also scrambled to sign the petition. Yesterday, Rep. Douglas
announced that in only three weeks a 218-Member majority had
signed, assuring the first vote on a balanced-budget
amendment since 1982. Now that the Douglas "sunshine" tactic
has worked, we hope other Members use it to pry loose
legislation the House leadership has buried.
