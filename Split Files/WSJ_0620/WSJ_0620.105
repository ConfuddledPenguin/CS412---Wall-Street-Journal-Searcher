   NEW YORK -- New municipal and asset-backed securities were
issued at a feverish pace yesterday with a combined total of
more than $3 billion in notes and bonds hitting the market.
   Dealers said the asset-backed securities were easily
absorbed yesterday, but some of the tax-exempt bonds met
strong investor resistance, as municipal-bond prices eased.

   "It's a very tough market," said Frank Kenney, a vice
president in municipal bond underwriting at Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co.
   Traders said the lack of interest in municipal bonds
reflects growing concern that interest rates will rise as the
Federal government swamps the bond market with supply in the
weeks and months ahead. Some analysts believe the government
could raise more than $70 billion in the bond market during
the third quarter.
   Rather than buy bonds now, when the interest-rate outlook
is murky and investor sentiment has turned negative, some
investors have decided to wait and see what happens.
   "Buyers have put on the brakes, they have not taken the
aggressive stance that we saw in prior weeks," said Joe
Piraro, a municipal bond trader at First Chicago Capital
Markets. "The market participants are nervous. They can sense
that the flow is not like it was."
   The largest municipal offering yesterday was Los Angeles
County's $1.1 billion tax and revenue anticipation note
offering due July 1, 1991. The notes were priced by a group
led by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to yield 5.80% with a coupon rate
of 6.25%.
   In an unusual move, $100 million of 30-year industrial
development revenue bonds issued by Clark County (Nev.) on
behalf of Nevada Power Co. were repriced yesterday at a yield
of 7.88%. That was 1/4 percentage point higher than the
original 7.64% yield set on Monday.
   Underwriters at Goldman Sachs said the yield was adjusted
after Nevada Power decided to issue the bonds without
bondholder insurance. Typically, such insurance raises the
debt rating on an issue and thus lowers the issue's yield,
which results in substantial savings for the issuer. But in
recent days, the difference between yields on uninsured and
insured bonds has narrowed, said Goldman's Mr. Kenney.
Officials at Nevada Power said it was cheaper to issue the
bonds without insurance.
   The $1.5 billion of asset-backed securities sold yesterday
was just the beginning of an expected onslaught of such
issues.
   The largest of the three major asset-backed deals priced
yesterday was a $1 billion credit card-backed issue from
First Chicago Corp. that was sold globally by First Boston
Corp. and its European affiliate Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd. Underwriters said the five-year securities, which were
priced at 99.91 to yield 9.271%, sold out quickly.
   Meanwhile, Norwest Corp. offered $400 million in
credit-card securities through Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. issued $95 million in securities backed
by mortgages on manufactured homes.
   Traders and analysts said that despite the heavy supply,
the securities were readily absorbed because they tap the
maturity ranges that are most eagerly sought by investors and
because there has been fairly light asset-backed issuance in
past weeks.
   "A lot of people in the asset-backed market are wondering,
`Can you absorb all this without driving spreads out?,'" said
Michael Basset, vice president at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates in Princeton, N.J. The supply coming soon will be
"something of a test for the market," he said.
   Whether the market can pass the test will be determined
very soon. At least three huge asset-backed issues totaling
$2.75 billion are expected later this week.
   Salomon Brothers Inc. said it plans to price $1 billion in
five-year Chrysler Co. securities backed by automobile loans
today. Citicorp is also expected to tap the global market
today with $1.25 billion of five-year credit-card backed
bonds. First Boston Corp. and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.
are expected to be lead managers.
   Also in the wings, a $500 million Chrysler Financing Corp.
issue will be lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corp. by early July.
The underwriter will kick off an international road show
today for the offering -- the first asset-backed deal to
package loans made to car dealers rather than car buyers.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of U.S. Treasurys fell again as concerns re-emerged
about the looming increase in government debt issuance and
skepticism about a near-term budget accord. Some analysts
believe the government will raise more than $70 billion
during the third quarter.
   The heavy load of new debt will begin next week when the
government sells new two-year and four-year notes.
   In early July, an issue of long-term bonds is expected
from the Resolution Funding Corp., the agency set up to
finance the thrift bailout.
   In trading, the benchmark 30-year bond fell about 1/4
point, or about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The benchmark bond was quoted late at a price of 102 27/32 to
yield 8.47%, compared with 103 2/32 to yield 8.46% on Monday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 102 11/32 to
yield 8.50%, compared with 102 15/32 to yield 8.48% on
Monday.
   Short-term rates were essentially unchanged. The discount
rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.74% for a
bondequivalent yield of 7.98%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.65% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.05%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, ended firmer
yesterday following two sharp back-to-back declines on Monday
and Friday.
   Bond-market analysts attributed the turnaround to comments
by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said her
government will maintain its current tight monetary policy
and that "interest rates at 15% will succeed in bringing
inflation down."
   In trading, Britain's 11.75% securities due 2003/2007 rose
1/4 point to 101 28/32 to yield 11.47%. The 12% issue due
1995 rose 2/32 to 99 22/32 to yield 12.10%.
   Most West German bonds ended little changed. Dealers said
the market is likely to remain quiet ahead of July 1, when
monetary union between East and West Germany takes place and
the first of the German Unity Fund bonds will be sold.
   In Tokyo, the Japanese government bond market ended weaker
as bearish sentiment continued to spread.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds, speculative-grade securities with low credit
ratings or no credit ratings at all, fell between 1/4 to 3/8
point.
   The notable exceptions to the broadbased decline were the
bonds of Trump Castle Funding Inc., which staged a partial
rebound from extremely low levels on the prospects that an
accord between Donald Trump and his banks is imminent.
   Trump Castle's 13.75% first mortgage bonds advanced 1 5/8
points to 58 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange while Trump
Castle's 7% issue gained 1 1/8 points to 36 1/2. Most other
Trump issues were unchanged to slightly lower.
   In the investment-grade corporate bond market, most bonds
finished unchanged to 1/8 point lower.
   Among new offerings, African Development Bank became the
latest so-called Yankee issuer to hit the U.S. debt market
when it sold $300 million of 10-year subordinated notes
priced to yield 9.37%. Yankee issuers are foreign companies
or agencies that sell dollar-denominated securities in the
U.S. capital markets.
   The African Development Bank issue was co-managed by
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. and Pryor, McClendon, Counts &amp; Co., a
black-owned underwriting firm. The offering represents the
first corporate debt deal Pryor McClendon has co-managed this
year.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities ended with slight losses.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for July delivery were 5/32 lower on the day at 98 29/32 to
yield 9.79%.
   In the area of real estate mortgage investment conduits,
Salomon Brothers Inc. priced a Federal National Mortgage
Assocation issue totaling $300 million that was backed by
Fannie Mae 10% securities.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Ginnie Mae 10%
issues were 3/32 lower on the day at 101 3/8, Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were down 1/8 at 98 1/4
and Fannie Mae 9.5% securities were 1/8 softer at 98 3/4.
