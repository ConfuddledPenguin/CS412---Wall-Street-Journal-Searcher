   The acquired reserves are in an area offshore from
Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico where Freeport Resource
Partners has a 67 million-long-ton sulfur reserve with
venture partners IMC Fertilizer Group Inc. and Homestake
Mining Co.
   Freeport Resource Partners said it expects expenditures of
close to $100 million to develop the acquired oil and gas
reserves. Chevron retains the right, under certain
conditions, to a portion of the profits of future oil
production if price or volumes exceed certain levels.
