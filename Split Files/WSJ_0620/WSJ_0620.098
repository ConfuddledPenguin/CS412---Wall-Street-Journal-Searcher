   Allegheny Ludlum Corp. told securities analysts that its
markets, except for automotive, are strong and that orders
are 25% ahead of its 1990 plan.
   In the current fiscal second quarter, ending July 2, the
company said shipments should be up at least 10% from the
year-earlier's 126,419 tons. In the 1989 second quarter the
company earned $36.7 million, or $1.63 a share.

   However, the Pittsburgh specialty steel producer said it
expects sales in the latest quarter to decline from $333.8
million a year ago, citing the absence of raw material
surcharges.
   "We are surprised at the strength in the market. Our
backlog is growing, exports are turning up, and the third
quarter is looking much stronger than anticipated," the
company said.
