   WASHINGTON -- A House committee, on a day in which the
White House assailed Democrats for the savings-and-loan mess,
got its clearest look yet at the government's case against
President Bush's son Neil stemming from his involvement in a
failed Denver thrift.
   In a draft of administrative charges that are the basis
for actions being taken against Neil Bush, thrift regulators
said Mr. Bush, a former director of Silverado Banking,
Savings &amp; Loan Association, never told the board of a $3
million loan he received from Denver developer Kenneth Good.
At the same time, Silverado's board was considering releasing
Mr. Good from having to repay $8.5 million of borrowings
because of his financial difficulties. Mr. Bush abstained
from voting on that matter.

   "Bush willfully breached his fiduciary duty to Silverado
Banking by failing to disclose" that information, said the
draft, which was released by the House Banking Committee. Mr.
Bush, an outside director, was never an operating officer of
Silverado. The charge is the most severe of three outlined in
the draft enforcement resolution.
   Mr. Good eventually defaulted on $31 million in Silverado
loans. The Office of Thrift Supervision declined to comment
on the draft, except to say thrift regulators lack sufficient
evidence to seek an order barring Mr. Bush from the thrift or
banking industries. Five former Silverado directors and
officers have consented to be barred from the industry.
   Instead, thrift regulators have Mr. Bush's case before an
administrative law judge, seeking a cease-and-desist order
that would prohibit Mr. Bush from engaging in unsafe banking
or thrift activities. The administrative law judge will
recommend any action to be taken against Mr. Bush to Timothy
Ryan, who is director of the thrift office and was special
counsel to President Bush's 1988 campaign.
   The enforcement resolution also contended that Neil Bush
should have abstained in votes approving loans to another
business associate, Bill Walters. Mr. Bush also failed to
disclose his business relationship with Mr. Good when
Silverado approved a $900,000 line of credit for the
developer, the resolution said. Mr. Bush couldn't be reached
for comment.
   In an appearance last month before the Banking Committee,
Mr. Bush said his links to borrowers who defaulted on loans
posed no conflict of interest. He said that while his
business partners invested in his oil and gas operations, he
didn't invest in their businesses and thus wouldn't benefit
by helping them obtain loans.
   At a 9 1/2-hour hearing yesterday, members criticized
regulators for failing to rein in Silverado sooner and
questioned a series of complex deals between Silverado
officers.
   One window into the attitude of Silverado's operating
officers toward its directors was a 1986 memo to Mike Wise,
former Silverado chairman, from the chief operating officer,
Richard Vandapool.
   "In 1986, you should reduce the number of directors to a
bare regulatory minimum, reduce the number of director
meetings to four each year and then let the executive
committee deal with monthly issues and requirements," it
said, referring to the board positions, including Mr. Bush's,
as "rubber-stamp directorships."
   At yesterday's hearing, Mr. Vandapool called the memo
"tongue in cheek" and said the board was actually expanded
later.
   Silverado, whose losses totaled roughly $1 billion, was
sold with another thrift to First Nationwide, the thrift
subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.
   Meanwhile, the White House pointedly tried to defend
President Bush from attempts to blame him or other
Republicans for the prolonged S&amp;L debacle. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater launched the effort by urging
reporters to examine the roles of various Democrats.
   "I'm saying the Democrats have a big role in it. . . .
Take a look at {former House Speaker} Jim Wright and {former
Rep.} Tony Coelho and Mr. {Sen. Bob} Kerrey and some of his
Nebraska accounts and {Michigan Sen.} Don Riegle and {Arizona
Sen. Dennis} DeConcini -- take a look at all of them," Mr.
Fitzwater said. "If they want to make this a political issue,
we'll be glad to do it."
   Mr. Fitzwater also singled out former House Banking
Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain, saying, "I don't think
you hear any serious analysis of this problem that doesn't
point to Freddy St Germain and the changes that were made in
the banking laws back at that point." Former Rhode Island
Rep. St Germain was instrumental in the adoption of laws
deregulating the thrift industry but was defeated in the 1988
election after close ties to thrift lobbyists and other
questionable practices were exposed.
   Mr. Fitzwater said the White House's pique was stirred by
speeches by Sen. Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who has
questioned the administration's estimates of the cost of the
thrift bailout and has referred to Mr. Bush as "the S&amp;L
president." Each of the other lawmakers Mr. Fitzwater
mentioned has been tied to thrift executives in incidents
that have caused them political damage. But Mr. Kerrey hasn't
been accused of any improper action involving thrifts, and
Mr. Fitzwater didn't provide any examples, saying only that
reporters should look into it.
   Democrats reacted with outrage to Mr. Fitzwater's
suggestion that they are unfairly politicizing the thrift
issue, and they vowed to continue speaking out. Mr. Kerrey
said on the Senate floor that Democrats ought to become more
outspoken and not be "threatened by petulant statements by a
press secretary."
