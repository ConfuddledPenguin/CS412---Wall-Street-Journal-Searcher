   A roundup in recent days of Red Army Faction suspects in
East Germany -- some of whom were involved in attacks on U.S.
soldiers -- and mob attacks last week on dissidents in
Romania tell us something both about the past and the
present. The German investigations will confirm what
anti-terrorist forces in the West have long had cause to
believe -- that much of Western Europe's terrorism and
political violence have been stage-managed by the secret
police of Communist countries. The assaults in Bucharest by
"miners" while authorities turned a blind eye make it clear
that in some East European countries the word Communist has
been expunged, but not the tactics.
   East Germany's new Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel
Friday called the links to terrorism of the former government
"one of the most shameful chapters" in East German history.
Yesterday the East German police arrested yet another
suspected member of the Red Army Faction, thought to have
been involved in the 1981 bombing of the U.S. Ramstein Air
Base. On Saturday, authorities arrested a 40-year-old woman
wanted in connection with the 1985 murder of a U.S. soldier
outside a discotheque near Wiesbaden.

   German investigators say their arrests show that the
former Stasi, or East German secret police, had regularly
offered refuge, false identities and political protection to
West Germans being sought for terrorism. The wave of arrests
in recent days has focused particularly on the Red Army
Faction, which has claimed "credit" for a long string of
terrorist crimes, including the murder in November of Alfred
Herrhausen, the highly respected head of Deutsche Bank.
   Mr. Diestel clearly has learned enough from the Stasi
files to know that such groups were not merely crazies but
were instruments of a government. The crimes were in fact
committed by a Communist state hostile to the West.
   That tells a lot more than some people have cared to know
about the sources of terrorism in Europe. One of the most
spectacular in the long list of crimes was, of course, the
shooting of Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square in 1981
by the Turk Mehmet Ali Agca. Although Italian authorities
never chose to directly accuse other governments of
instigating the attempt, investigations of Mr. Agca's
pre-crime activities leave little doubt. His sojourns in
Bulgaria and East Berlin, where someone of his background
would have been known to the secret police, and the aid he
received from Sergei Antonov, a Bulgarian state airline
employee, were part of a damning chain of evidence.
   Obviously the world is not as easily fooled by such tricks
as it once was. Who can really believe that a group of
ordinary Romanian miners organized themselves and arranged
transportation to Bucharest and other cities in a spontaneous
show of support for Romania's President Iliescu?
   But some credulity gaps remain to be closed. Defectors
from East European governments over the past two decades have
testified that East European secret police organizations, by
and large, operated under the guidance of that vast mother
organization in Moscow, the KGB. The KGB still is very much
in business. Moscow insiders say its funding has been
expanded by Mikhail Gorbachev for two reasons: It has lost
important assets, such as Stasi; and keeping the KGB happy is
vital to a Soviet leader attempting a major reform.
   According to an article on this page in November 1984 by
Zdzislaw M. Rurarz, former Polish ambassador to Japan, the
Polish secret police were under KGB guidance at the time of
the assassination of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a Polish
Catholic priest. He had become a thorn in the side of the
Communist Party.
   Last month, a BBC documentary offered impressive evidence
that a Soviet KGB officer assisted efforts to inflame
Czechoslovakians against the old Stalinist regime. The plot
was to replace the Stalinists with a new Communist leadership
more to Mr. Gorbachev's liking. The effort failed and Vaclav
Havel, definitely not Mr. Gorbachev's man, has just been
elected president of the Czech and Slovak Republics.
   Europe has changed dramatically in a year as the Poles,
the Czechoslovakians, the Hungarians and the East Germans
have shucked off Communist regimes. Continuing investigations
in East Germany will shed much light on what has gone on
before. But the age of state-supported thuggery is not yet
over by any means. It's always good to keep that in mind.
