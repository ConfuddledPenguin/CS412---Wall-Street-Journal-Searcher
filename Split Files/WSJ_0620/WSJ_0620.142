   JERICHO, N.Y. -- Getty Petroleum Corp. said the U.S.
Attorney's office in Brooklyn intends to seek indictments
against the company's Getty Terminals Corp. unit and an
executive.
   The independent gasoline marketer said the possible
indictments are related to an alleged conspiracy with a
customer to evade certain federal gasoline excise taxes in
1985.

   The office of U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney advised the
company that the government intends to seek the indictments,
Getty said. Getty called the allegations without merit and
said that if it is indicted, it will vigorously defend
itself.
   Getty Petroleum, formerly Power Test Corp., was formed out
of the purchase of the Getty name, marketing assets, and
terminals from Texaco Inc., when the White Plains, N.Y., oil
giant bought Getty Oil Co. Getty Petroleum also markets
heating oil and is a wholesale distributor of a variety of
petroleum products through its East Coast petroleum storage
and distribution network.
   Spokesmen for Getty and Mr. Maloney's office couldn't be
reached for elaboration.
