   CUSTOMERS may not like it, but more software makers are
installing 900 numbers to make users pay for advice.
   "The idea seems to be catching on," says Jeffrey Tarter,
editor of SoftLetter, a Watertown, Mass., newsletter.
   Phone support has been a bone of contention between
customers and software makers for years. The companies say
answering questions is time-consuming and costly. Customers
say they have to call because software and instructions are
incomprehensible.
   The software makers, which have started charging $1 to $2
a minute, justify the fees by saying they pay for
improvements in service. Buttonware Inc., a Bellevue, Wash.,
maker of PC File, a $129 database, says it has doubled the
number of advisers since beginning a $1-a-minute 900 line.
"We thought we'd get roasted," says a spokeswoman. "But we
found that people are willing to pay. They just want the
help."
   Industry giant Microsoft Inc. has installed a 900 line to
help people with questions about MS-DOS, the operating
systems it designed but sells through other companies. In the
past, it didn't provide much help to puzzled DOS users, nor
did anyone else, customers say. Lotus Development Corp.,
maker of best-selling spreadsheet 1-2-3, and Aldus Corp.,
maker of the desktop publishing program PageMaker, are also
trying out 900 numbers.
   Russ Walter, a computer-book author in Somerville, Mass.,
who answers phone queries for free, says, "I'd hate to see it
become the norm." After all, he says, "one marketing pitch is
that they support their customers." Another problem: Many
companies have switchboards that block users from dialing 900
numbers.
                                                                                                       

   Checking Photo I.D.s
   On a Computer Screen

   INVENTORS have struggled for years to meld computers with
security systems.
   Various companies already have marketed electronic devices
that check identities by examining eyes or by sensing the
speed and pressure with which people write their names.
   Now, Sacody Technologies Inc., New York, has developed a
straightforward system that lets clerks or security guards
call up stored photos and signatures on a three-inch screen.
Because pictures of authorized customers or employees are
stored on a disk, crooks can't get by with forged
identification cards.
   Sacody has devised a way to compress identification
photographs to 5,000 bytes of information, allowing storage
of 5,000 photos on a 30-megabyte personal-computer disk.
Without compression, a photo takes about 50,000 bytes. The
amount of data is small enough so the information can be sent
from a disk to a Sacody terminal in six seconds on a
local-area network or 15 seconds over a regular phone line.
   One early user, Turtle Cove Golf Club, a New York driving
range, says the system helps workers confirm that a golfer
has credit in his account before handing out a bucket of
balls.
                                                                                                       

   MIPS Keeps Slipping
   As a Speed Standard
                                                                                                       

   THE COMMON measure of computer speed, MIPS, is an acronym
for millions of instructions per second, but cynical
customers joke that it means meaningless indicator of
processor speed or even marketing instructions for pushy
salespeople.
   Now, a new suite of measurements called SPEC, which is
being used widely by makers of engineering workstations,
makes clear just how meaningless MIPS can be. The 10 SPEC
benchmark programs were designed to provide consistent speed
comparisons among computers doing various types of jobs.
   John R. Mashey, a vice president at MIPS Computer Systems
Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif., workstation maker, recently
compared vendors' MIPS speed claims with their reported SPEC
performance numbers. It turns out the customers have a right
to be cynical. While Mr. Mashey says the vendors had
legitimate reasons for their MIPS claims, the ratings could
badly mislead customers.
   In the study, Mr. Mashey concludes that one of his
company's workstations rated at 20 MIPS "shows similar
performance on integer programs" to an International Business
Machines Corp. RS/6000 rated at 34.5 MIPS and is twice as
fast as a Sun Microsystems Inc. 12.5 MIPS workstation. A
Digital Equipment Corp. VAX workstation's SPEC performance
translates into about 90% of its claimed MIPS, but a Digital
RISC workstation is about 83%.
   Overall, Mr. Mashey says that actual performance as
measured by SPEC ranges from 54% to 96% of companies' MIPS
claims. In floating-point operations, which reflect
scientific performance, differences range from 34% to 135%.
"There is no such thing as a MIPS rating that means much," he
concludes.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE companies invested a record $320 million in small
U.S. technology companies last year, says Venture Economics
Inc., a Wellesley, Mass., research firm. Even without the
$100 million investment by Canon Inc. in Stephen Jobs's Next
Inc., that was 25% higher than the $176 million recorded in
1988. . . . Philip Emeagwali, a Nigerian graduate student at
the University of Michigan, won the Gordon Bell Prize for
last year's most cost-effective supercomputer program, a
simulation of an underground oil reservoir that he wrote for
the Connection Machine, a computer with 65,000
microprocessors connected together. The fastest conventional
supercomputers link eight very powerful processors. Mr.
Emeagwali compares big processors to oxen and small ones to
chickens: "If the chickens coordinate their efforts, they'll
do a better job."
