   NEW YORK -- An agreement under which FlightSafety
International Inc. was to acquire certain assets of Bicoastal
Corp.'s SimuFlite division was terminated, the companies
said.
   In April, FlightSafety agreed to pay about $64 million for
the assets and to assume about $19 million in long-term debt.
Both FlightSafety and SimuFlite have interests in pilot
training.

   FlightSafety Chairman Albert L. Ueltschi declined to say
why the plan was ended. Bicoastal, Tampa, Fla., couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Bicoastal, formerly Singer Co., has been shedding various
assets of what had been a defense-electronics company.
