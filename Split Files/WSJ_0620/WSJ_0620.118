   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A federal grand jury indicted the
retired head of the Food and Drug Administration's
generic-drug division on two counts of perjury in a
corruption scandal involving the division.
   The indictment accuses Marvin Seife of lying to government
investigators about meetings with generic-drug company
executives and about whether he let the executives buy him
meals, said U.S. Attorney Breckinridge Willcox.

   The indictment was the latest development in a two-year
investigation of corruption in the generic-drug industry and
among its regulators.
   Mr. Seife, of San Antonio, Texas, retired Dec. 31 after 17
years as director of the generic-drug division, where he was
responsible for reviewing manufacturers' applications to
market generic drugs.
   According to the indictment, Mr. Seife in a sworn
statement to an FDA investigator falsely denied meeting with
two generic-drug company executives in 1987 to discuss FDA
matters. The indictment also alleges that Mr. Seife made a
similar false statement last year to a House subcommittee.
   The second count of the indictment charges that Mr. Siefe
lied to FDA investigators when he said he had never had meals
with the executives. The indictment alleges he accepted
numerous lunches, dinners and drinks paid for by generic-drug
companies.
   If convicted on both counts, Mr. Seife would face a
maximum of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
