   WASHINGTON -- A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee recommended approving a test kit that would
facilitate hormonal therapy for breast cancer.
   The kit, which will be marketed only to clinical
laboratories, is intended to measure a woman's response, or
likelihood of response, to hormonal therapy, which is a less
traumatizing alternative to chemotherapy.

   The test kit, known as an enzyme immunoassay, is
manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill. It
will be marketed under the product name Abbott PGR-EIA.
   The advisory committee said the kit "is only to be used as
an adjunct" to other methods of measuring the progress of
breast cancer tumors, an FDA official said.
