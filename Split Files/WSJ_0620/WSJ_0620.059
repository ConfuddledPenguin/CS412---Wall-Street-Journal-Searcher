   Bayer AG of West Germany, a chemical concern, said that
its group earnings declined in the first five months of this
year, though it didn't disclose profit figures, and that
group sales fell 2.2% to 18.25 billion marks ($10.89 billion)
from 18.66 billion marks a year earlier.
   The announcement at Bayer's annual meeting confirmed
expectations of falling profits in the West German chemical
industry, following several years of record results. Bayer
said foreign-exchange fluctuations alone reduced its sales by
about one billion marks and also depressed earnings.
