   Advantage Life Products Inc. said it signed a letter of
intent agreeing to settle litigation with More Direct Health
Products Inc. More Direct, based in Carlsbad, Calif., is
Advantage's sole supplier of a stop-smoking product whose
retail distribution is Advantage's main business.
   The proposed settlement would bring More Direct's top
officer onto Advantage's board and give More Direct warrants
to buy 400,000 shares of Advantage stock, equivalent to 8.7%
of the about 4.6 million shares currently outstanding.
</LP>

   Advantage, based in Laguna Hills, Calif., said More
Direct's warrants would be exercisable at the June 12 closing
price for its stock, which finished the day at $3 bid,
$3.1875 asked, in over-the-counter trading. Yesterday,
Advantage stock jumped $1 a share to close at $4.3125 bid.
   The proposed settlement continues indefinitely a sales
agreement between the two companies that otherwise would have
expired in 1995. The arrangement includes 15% annual
increases in Advantage's minimum purchases after 1995.
