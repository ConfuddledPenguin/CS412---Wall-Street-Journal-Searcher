   Suddenly, the problem isn't what's in the Perrier but what
the Perrier is in.
   The latest twist in the much publicized Perrier recall
last February is a controversy over milk crates -- lots of
them -- into which retailers hastily dumped bottles of the
suspect French mineral water.

   The disappearance of thousands of milk crates was first
noticed by deliverymen working for Farmland Dairy,
Wallington, N.J., the state's second-biggest dairy.
Farmland's president, Marc Goldman, sent out sleuths who
traced the missing containers to an Elizabeth, N.J.,
warehouse he says is filled with discarded bottles of
designer water. It seems retailers -- faced with recall
orders after traces of benzene, a carcinogen, were found in
the bubbly water -- had simply tossed the green bottles into
any available receptacles, including empty fruit, cornflake
and tampon cases -- and plastic milk crates.
   The discovery of the missing crates raised Mr. Goldman's
ire. Last month, he brought criminal charges against the
Elizabeth warehouse, Distribution Warehouse &amp; Service Corp.,
and a Newark, N.J., recycler, REI Distributors, alleging
illegal possession of milk crates.
   Mr. Goldman, his good nature already sorely tested by more
commonplace milkcrate miscreants, fumes that Farmland will
have to replace as many as 50,000 of its approximately
175,000 crates, whose cost of about $3 each is passed along
to consumers.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. unit of Source Perrier S.A.
denies any malicious intent. The recall started suddenly on a
Friday night, she explains, and "everybody was just
scrambling to do the best they could."
   Robert Kortenhaus, a vice president at the warehouse, says
he's got Perrier stored in crates from about 24 Northeastern
dairies and he's trying to return the crates as fast as he
can. Getting permits to dispose of the water took time, he
says. "You can't just dump large amounts of Perrier into the
Newark sewer system."
   Joe Mastriano, the official named in Farmland's complaint
against the recycler, thinks he's being blamed because Mr.
Goldman is afraid to confront the real culprits: his own
customers. "It would be the same as if someone had stolen a
car and dropped it off on your property," Mr. Mastriano says.
He is understandably pretty sour about the whole affair. If
convicted under New Jersey's Milk Case Recovery Act, he could
face 30 days in jail.

   A STORY on page B1 of yesterday's edition incorrectly
reported that Distribution Warehouse &amp; Service Corp. and REI
Distributors were named in criminal complaints brought by an
individual alleging the misuse of milk crates. Neither
company was named in the complaints, and neither has been
accused of any illegality. The complaints name an individual
at each company, but not the company itself.
