   I was struck by the drawing of Karl Marx's grave in your
June 6 page-one article "Those Still Longing for Class
Struggle Might Try London." The grave seemed to be in pretty
good shape.
   Seven summers ago, I was in Edinborough, Scotland, for a
couple of days. Finding myself with a bit of free time, I
thought that I would pop into a handy bookstore and pick up a
copy of "Wealth of Nations." Not only could I not find a copy
after popping into many bookstores, but also I couldn't find
a bookstore proprietor who had ever heard of Adam Smith]

   Disappointed, I took another tack and was able to get a
line on where he was buried. I found the site and more
disappointment. The cemetery is tucked back off Holyrood
Street toward the palace end. It is nondescript, and though
Adam Smith's gravestone is legible, it is overrun with weeds.
It seems the Scots have forsaken their most, arguably, famous
contributor to the course of human events. Perhaps with Marx,
Lenin, Stalin, et al. being revisioned down, it's time to
refurbish Adam Smith's grave along with his image.
