   From an address by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari to the Business Roundtable on June 11:

   There is a certain uneasiness in the United States
concerning loss of jobs for Americans and migration flows
from Mexico that could result from a free trade agreement. In
my opinion, this uneasiness is unfounded. In Mexico, we seek
to export goods, not labor. To date, the lack of
opportunities in Mexico and better paid jobs on the other
side of the border have been the main driving forces behind
Mexican migration. I am convinced that greater access for
Mexican goods to the United States market and major
investment in Mexico will provide better job opportunities in
my country, together with a lesser and more orderly flow of
workers.
