   ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif., said fiscal
second-quarter net income rose 78% to $2.8 million from $1.5
million a year ago, reflecting higher international sales and
other benefits of a recent acquisition.
   Sales more than doubled to $35.3 million from $14.2
million in the quarter ended May 31. Per-share net was 25
cents compared with 15 cents, restated to reflect a 20% stock
dividend paid in August.

   ICN Biomedicals attributed its increases to the strength
of the company's development and marketing of biomedical
research tests and to the sales volume of Flow Laboratories,
acquired in November.
   The company said that international sales jumped to $20.8
million from $1.7 million, mainly reflecting Flow sales,
which are primarily in Europe, Japan and Australia. Flow
produces laboratory equipment, live cells and related
products for life-science research.
   In national over-the-counter trading, ICN Biomedicals fell
12.5 cents to $9.625.
