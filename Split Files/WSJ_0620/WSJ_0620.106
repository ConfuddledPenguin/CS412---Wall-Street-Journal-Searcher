   Andrew Ferguson's June 4 Leisure &amp; Arts review of Vladimir
Pozner's "Parting With Illusions" quotes Mr. Pozner as
saying: "By 1947, I was getting beaten up at Stuyvesant High
for being pro-Soviet."
   Baloney. I graduated New York City's Stuyvesant High
School in 1950. (Question: was Edward Posner, my classmate,
his brother?) No one got beaten up at Stuyvesant in those
days. Our athletic teams were losers. Our idea of physicality
was a rousing chess game.

   As for being pro-Soviet . . . who wasn't? This was New
York, and we were mostly the children of proletarian Jews.
Anybody who got beaten up for his politics was probably a
Catholic Republican, and I never heard of them until I
entered the service during the Korean War.
   Get real. Mr. Pozner and P.T. Barnum are brothers under
the skin.
