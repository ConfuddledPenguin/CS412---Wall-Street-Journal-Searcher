   NEW YORK -- The dollar drifted lower against other major
currencies in thin trading. But the yen reaped few gains from
the weak U.S. currency, despite welcome economic reports in
Japan.
   In the trendless market, participants felt confident
buying currencies supported by high interest rates. As a
result, sterling closed in New York at its highest level
since the first quarter of 1989. The Australian dollar, which
rose strongly in Asian trading, added to those gains around
the globe.

   The dollar fluctuated in Europe and in the New York
morning between its global low on Monday of 1.6735 marks and
1.6770 marks. Twice it was stopped from falling below 1.6730
marks by strong buying interest from the Soviet Union, said
Jerry Egan, chief foreign exchange dealer for Bank of Boston.
   Explaining the unremitting downside pressure on the U.S.
currency, Mr. Egan said "there's a lot of technical bears out
there" after Monday's technical selloff against the mark.
   About midmorning in New York, on the market's third
attempt, the dollar fell below 1.6730 marks and sustained
institutional selling at 1.6715 marks. Finally, at 1.6680
marks, the U.S. currency found support, Mr. Egan said, and
bounced back above 1.67 marks.
   The dollar remained above that level the rest of the day,
partly as a result of the emergence of buying interest among
Middle Eastern investors, Mr. Egan said.
   Monday "appears to have been the keynote day," said Keith
Cheveralls, foreign exchange manager for Nippon Credit Bank
in New York, and yesterday "would appear to be a continuation
of that."
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6738
marks, down from 1.6758 marks late Monday. The U.S. currency
also stood at 153.55 yen, down from 153.66.
   At midmorning Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading
at 153.88 yen; it closed Tuesday in Tokyo at 153.72 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6773
marks, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.6757 marks.
   On Tuesday, sterling was trading at $1.7210, well above
$1.7145 late Monday. The last time the pound closed higher in
New York was March 22, 1989, when it ended at $1.7270.
   Once again, the yen failed to match the success of other
currencies against the dollar. The Japanese currency was
sold, along with the U.S. currency, for marks and Swiss
francs.
   News that Japan's broad money supply, M2 plus certificates
of deposit, grew at a 13.2% year-on-year pace in May had
little impact on currency markets around the world, even
though Tokyo credit-market participants said the report
probably will reinforce the Bank of Japan's tight monetary
policy.
   Similarly ignored was the report that Japan's real gross
national product grew 2.5% in the fiscal fourth quarter,
making a 10.4% annual growth rate.
   "One would have thought" the economic reports would have
helped the yen yesterday, Mr. Cheveralls said, "but the
underlying environment is one of yen weakness. One could say
the fundamentals are offering a modicum of support in what
otherwise would be a weaker market for the yen."
   Mr. Cheveralls said the possibility of a political scandal
touching Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was just one
element contributing to the bearish attitude traders have
developed toward the yen.
   Looking for a way to make money in the quiet market,
investors turned to currencies supported by high interest
rates. But potential buyers are shying away from the Canadian
dollar until the constitutional dispute over Quebec is
resolved.
   The Australian dollar bounded through the 78 U.S. cents
level in Asian trading, with Japanese investors providing the
initial burst of buying. The currency stalled at 78.30 cents
when Sydney participants failed to follow through.
   Markets in Europe and North America, however, picked up
the ball, lifting the Australian dollar to an intraday high
of 78.45 cents. It closed in New York at 78.35 cents.
   The Australian currency is being supported by bank bill
and cash rates above 15%. "Until the (Australian government)
administration gives an inkling it's willing to relax
interest rates," Bank of Boston's Mr. Egan said, the
Australian dollar "is going to remain a glamorous
high-yielder."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $349.10 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 1.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $347.85 an
ounce.
