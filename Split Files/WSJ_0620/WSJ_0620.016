   PHILADELPHIA -- Bell Atlantic Corp. said it signed an
agreement to acquire Simborg Systems Corp. in an all-stock
transaction but didn't disclose the terms.
   Closely held Simborg, based in Greenbrae, Calif., develops
hospital information management systems and is a pioneer in
open architecture systems for the health care industry.

   Bell Atlantic is a telecommunications company.
   Bell Atlantic said the purchase -- which would involve its
first subsidiary in the hospital information industry -- will
be closed within 60 days and the venture will be renamed Bell
Atlantic Healthcare Systems, providing total patient care
solutions for hospitals and other health care facilities in
the U.S.and Canada.
   Donald W. Simborg, who founded the company in 1984, will
become president of Bell Atlantic Healthcare Systems. All of
Simborg Systems' 40 employees are expected to join the new
company, Bell Atlantic said.
   Simborg System's STAT LAN hospital network product,
currently used in 25 U.S. hospitals, will complement network
and business systems offered by Bell Atlantic units.
   "STAT LAN is a backbone to a network to which a customer
can plug in applications," a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman said.
   "Healthcare is a major thrust for Bell Atlantic," said
Jeffrey S. McDermott, president of Bell Atlantic Software and
Systems Solutions division, which will oversee the
acquisition.
   The STAT LAN health care information network uses the
latest local area network and microcomputer technology,
allowing different hospital departments to run independent
systems and to share information over the network.
   The company said Bell Atlantic Healthcare Systems will
market sales of STAT LAN and will continue joint marketing
accords with distributors such as Andersen Consulting and
Ameritech Corp., both based in Chicago.
   Douglas Ryckman, managing partner of Andersen Consulting,
said hospital systems must evolve to include open
architecture and networking.
   Industry consultant Sheldon Dorenfest said the deep
pockets of Bell Atlantic will give Simborg Systems the
"resources and staying power to further enhance STAT LAN and
become a major player in health care information systems."
   Clayton Brown, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in New York,
said the venture is another way for Bell Atlantic to
diversify. "The deal is different from Bell Atlantic's
cellular phone and yellow pages mainstays," he said.
   Bell Atlantic shares closed yesterday at $49.75, off 25
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
