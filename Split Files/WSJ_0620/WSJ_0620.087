   Seattle is mostly a tolerant and lush place. It tries very
hard to be very good. For 12 years, long after many
communities have decided that school busing for racial
balance paradoxically does not achieve racial balance, the
city has persisted without so much as a court order. Now even
Seattle is nearly ready to consider alternatives. Today the
school board is to consider five plans for scaling back the
busing project. The most ambitious proposal, by trustee
Kenneth Eastlack, would effectively end the idea of busing
children around the city solely for racial purposes.
   The emerald city is coming to recognize that this
much-heralded policy doesn't improve schools or integrate
them very well. It unavoidably causes many poor children to
spend an hour or more of potential learning time riding
around on a bus. And affluent white students find a way out
of the system.

   When the city began the program in 1978, it tried to mix
and match youngsters all over town, designating the fourth
through sixth grades and the high school years as pairing-off
periods. Part of the enrollment at a neighborhood school
would be swapped for students from a campus at the opposite
end of town (in Seattle, north is white and south is black).
That didn't work, so the authorities eventually came up with
a "controlled choice" formula that tries to keep minority
enrollment at any school within 20 percentage points of the
total minority share of the district.
   The result? Black south-siders have about twice as much
chance of being sent by bus to an out-of-neighborhood school
as north-side children. About 80% of south-siders are bused
to school, against only 35% of northsiders. The white share
of the system's enrollment has dropped to 45% from 62%. Total
enrollment in Seattle schools has dropped by more than half
over the past 20 years, to about 41,000. In the city's
current economic boom, households without children have been
buying many of the nice homes, while families moved to the
suburbs.
   Mr. Eastlack, who represents a white, working-class area
of West Seattle where opposition to busing is most
pronounced, thinks it's time to act. Lest enrollment take
another sharp drop, he wants to clear the air in time for
fall's reopening. Mr. Eastlack favors some integration
program, in part because he thinks the district will be sued
into one in any case, but he's recommending a loosened
formula: no more than 80% of one race in a school. All of the
schools currently would meet that standard without forced
busing.
   Seattle is fortunate, in that unlike a number of other
American cities its schools are still run by an elected board
and not a federal judge. It can choose. In fact, choice is
the key word here. It is now possible to suggest for the
first time that the busing model in the U.S. may be in the
process of being taken over by the choice model -- an
alternative that draws parents more tightly into the
education of their children.
   As Polly Williams is attempting to demonstrate in
Milwaukee, empowering parents to second guess the teacher
unions and central office is critical to busting the yoke
that weighs heavy on school performance in general and that
of poor urban minorities in particular. If the intent of
busing and other integration plans is to make sure all
students have an equal opportunity for good schools, the
provision of choice through vouchers or simple
school-selection options is looking more than ever like a
better way to go.
