   TOPSAIL, Newfoundland -- Kevin Dunn has come to this
church basement, on a hillside overlooking the blue and
choppy Atlantic, to ask his representative in the
Newfoundland legislature to vote against the Canadian
constitutional accord that would recognize French-speaking
Quebec as a "distinct society."
   Mr. Dunn and his 570,000 fellow Newfoundlanders are
distinct, too. "We're different," says the red-headed,
middle-aged Mr. Dunn. "Call us strange if you want, but we're
unique. We're 500 years old, and this time we're going to be
heard."

   Canada's future may hinge on their voice. If either
Newfoundland or Manitoba fails to ratify the Meech Lake
package of constitutional amendments by Saturday, the accord
will die -- and Quebec's movement toward total independence
from Canada will surge.
   Worried about making the emotional debate even hotter,
outsiders aren't rushing to Newfoundland to twist arms.
They're leaving the decision to the 52 members of
Newfoundland's legislature who begin a three-day debate on
the deal this morning.
   The power to influence history is a new sensation for
Newfoundland. Accounting for just 2.2% of Canada's
population, it is the poorest of the nation's provinces,
economically dependent on the Grand Banks fishery, and the
butt of countless "Newfie" jokes.
   As recently as the Great Depression of the 1930s
Newfoundland was governed as a British colony, and it joined
Canada only in 1949. It is nearer to Ireland than it is to
Miami or the Canadian prairies. There's a small,
French-speaking minority of 3,000 in the province. Most
Newfoundlanders live in modest clapboard homes along the
coves and bays of the island's bleak, forbidding and starkly
beautiful coast.
   The Dictionary of Newfoundland English includes 600 pages
of local words and expressions. In Newfoundland, Mother
Nature "slobs" a harbor with soft, mushy ice. A worthless
fellow too lazy to fish is an "angishore." Outsiders --
people who "come from away" -- find some Newfoundlanders'
thick accent incomprehensible.
   "Given our history and the fact that we live on an island
it isn't surprising that we're peculiar," says Cyril Poole,
editorin-chief of the Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and
Labrador. Labrador, largely uninhabited, is the mainland part
of the province, officially known as Newfoundland and
Labrador.
   If Newfoundland is peculiar, it is also peaceful. Police
don't carry guns here. Among other distinctions: There are no
public schools; the government largely finances four
religious school systems, one Catholic and three Protestant.
   Newfoundland politicians, who as a rule love the sound of
their own voices, regularly embrace goofy development
schemes. The latest failed project was going to make the
cloud-shrouded island a world-class producer of cucumbers by
growing them hydroponically in giant greenhouses.
   Mr. Poole delights in his province's place names: Witless
Bay, Blow Me Down, and Happy Adventure, as examples. Heart's
Content, Heart's Desire and Heart's Delight are all within a
few miles of each other. Mr. Poole's favorites are Nancy Oh,
Come By Chance, and Nicky's Nose.
   Newfoundland was discovered in 1497 by John Cabot. By the
1600s settlements were established to exploit the fishery,
which still employs almost a quarter of the labor force. "The
fishery just permeates the whole culture," Mr. Poole says.
   Every Newfoundlander knows classic songs such as
"Squid-Jiggin' Ground" even though squid is rarely jigged, or
caught by handline, these days. Eating cod is almost a duty
here. One traditional dish, fish and brewis, consists of
dried, salted cod and "hard bread" soaked overnight, then
cooked and served with scrunchions, small cubes of pork fat.
"Hard bread" is very, very hard. "Don't bite (an unsoaked)
one unless you have a great dental plan," advises Gerard
Power, a staffer at Purity Factories Ltd., which makes the
stuff.
   Times are hard in the fishery. Newfoundlanders blame the
Canadian government for the death of their sealing industry a
few years ago at the hands of foreign animal lovers. Now
Newfoundlanders say Ottawa is letting foreigners overfish and
slowly kill the cod fishery, the only source of jobs in many
of the province's tiny outports.
   Unemployment is so high that people talk about two kinds
of jobs here: permanent and "10-42." After ten weeks of
steady employment a worker qualifies for 42 weeks on the
dole. The jobless rate in May was 17.6%, compared with 7.6%
in Canada as a whole. Average household income in 1988 was
34,233 Canadian dollars, compared with $40,684 for the
country as a whole.
   The economic troubles feed antagonism toward Quebec.
Newfoundland has huge hydroelectric resources in Labrador,
but the province blundered in making a contract to sell the
power to Quebec at a price that is now only one-fifteenth the
prevailing rate. The contract runs until 2041. It is "kind of
a running sore," says Newfoundland writer Patrick O'Flaherty,
adding that a "strong latent anti-Quebec feeling" partly
motivates the opposition to the constitutional accord.
   It doesn't help that Quebec's separatist opposition party,
the Parti Quebecois, doesn't recognize Newfoundland's hold on
Labrador. And many Newfoundlanders, like other
English-speaking Canadians, believe that recognizing Quebec
as a "distinct society" will give it special power that other
provinces lack.
   Mr. O'Flaherty is one of several well-known
Newfoundlanders urging the legislature to ratify the accord.
He fears that Canada will break up if the accord dies. "It's
a choice between a flawed accord and possibly the future of
the country," Mr. O'Flaherty says. If Quebec were to
separate, Newfoundland would be even more isolated from the
rest of Canada, he says.
   Now Newfoundland's politicians are canvassing every town
and hamlet to sound the depth of feeling on the issue. Here
in Topsail, visitors in a steady stream stop by the church to
tell Patricia Cowan what they think. Ms. Cowan, the
province's minister of employment, represents the Topsail
district in the legislature, the House of Assembly.
   "No, no, a thousand times no]" a constituent says before
launching into an impassioned speech. The pastor of the
Anglican church also urges Ms. Cowan to reject the accord.
"I'm a Newfoundlander by birth, a Canadian by heart and a
Meech Lake opponent by nature," says the pastor, the Rev.
Lloyd Collett. In four hours 65 constituents drop in. Only
four support the accord.
   If the legislators vote according to the wishes of their
constituents the accord will fail. "It will be interesting to
see what happens," says Ms. Cowan.
   The Newfoundlanders' new-found political clout seems
destined for a short life. There's even a chance the vote
here will be canceled as meaningless, if the Meech Lake
accord dies first in the Manitoba legislature.
   Newfoundland visionaries can still nurture their dream of
independent nationhood for The Rock, as the province is
known. It had been a self-governing Commonwealth nation until
Britain took charge in 1934. Now, says singer Shawn McCann,
pointing to the unofficial green, white and pink flag of the
Republic of Newfoundland, "That's all we have left."
   If for nothing else, Newfoundlanders resent other
Canadians for their Newfie jokes, even though Newfoundlanders
are fond of telling them on themselves.
   "Two hunters go into the woods and shoot a moose," Ralph
Wiseman, Ms. Cowan's aide, relates. "They begin dragging it
back home by the tail. The tail breaks off. `What are we
going to do now?' one says to the other. A third hunter comes
along. `Why don't you just pull it by the head,' he says. `We
aren't going that way,' the first two reply."
   Says Ms. Cowan: "People here wouldn't like you tell that
story unless they were sure you were a friend."
