   Traditional Industries Inc. posted a net loss of $5.5
million, or $1.46 a share, for the nine months ended March
31, reflecting in part the impact of a Federal Trade
Commission settlement last year.
   Nine-month revenue dropped 8% to $40.8 million from $44.3
million. In the year-earlier period, the company had net
income of $4.7 million, or $1.31 a share.

   Traditional Industries, Agoura Hills, Calif., markets
photographic products and services; it didn't report any
third-quarter results. Company officials weren't available to
provide additional figures or comment.
   Last summer, the company reached a settlement with the FTC
regarding some of its sales practices. Under the agreement,
Traditional was required to set up a $250,000 trust fund to
provide refunds to certain customers.
   In a statement, Arland D. Dunn, chairman and chief
executive officer, said, "We have experienced in the past two
years an increase in canceled sales, defaulted payments and
slower collections." These problems are due to the FTC
settlement and to some bad accounts related to discontinued
operations, he said.
