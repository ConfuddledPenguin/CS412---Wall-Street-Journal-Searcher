   What's an investor to do?
   With the markets continuing to waffle between complacency

invest.

   Even the experts can't seem to agree about the outlook for
the economy, interest rates or corporate profits. Meanwhile,
political changes race ahead world-wide at a mind-numbing
pace.
   Some investment professionals recommend that individuals
use 10-year Treasury notes as the yardstick for comparing the
allure of various investment alternatives. At the moment,
while the pros don't rule out some selective stock picking,
they say that the risk-return trade-offs seem tipped in favor
of Treasurys.
   "I always start by asking myself why I do or don't want
(the 10-year Treasury) vs. something else," says Arthur
Zeikel, president of Merrill Lynch Asset Management Inc.
"It's the highest-quality investment, it's just 10 years, and
you know exactly what you're going to get if you hold it to
maturity."
   Bonds look increasingly attractive at current interest
rates the higher stocks go, the pros say. "If you compare
value, we're really at a place where stocks are pretty
overextended relative to bonds," says William Gross, managing
director at Pacific Investment Management Co.
   Risk-free 10-year Treasury notes currently yield about
8.4%, and the income is exempt from state and local taxes. By
comparison, the historical return on stocks has averaged
about 10% a year, but with far greater risk: Returns over
shorter periods, particularly less than 10 years, have varied
widely from the long-term average.
   To be sure, investors can still find yields above 8% on
some money-market mutual funds. With so little difference
between yields on these and other short-term investments and
those on longer-term investments, many people apparently see
little or no advantage in "going long."
   But such a flat "yield curve" has in the past been "a sign
you should extend maturities to take advantage of price
returns in the future," says Mr. Gross.
   James Hocking, U.S. chief investment officer at Citibank's
private banking group, estimates that if interest rates
decline, as some people expect, 10-year Treasury notes could
generate total returns -- including both interest payments
and capital appreciation -- of 12% to 15%. "It's an unusual
opportunity investors shouldn't miss," he says.
   As for stocks, most pros agree that the market -- at least
as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index or the Dow
Jones Industrials -- looks pricey based on earnings, interest
rates and other valuation criteria. They say that stocks, as
a group, are likely to disappoint investors, either with
lackluster performance or outright losses in the near term.
   "If you exclude 1987 before the crash, the market is now
selling at a higher valuation than it has at any time since
1972," says Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio
strategist at First Boston Corp. "If you've been conservative
for the last two years about putting money in stocks, this is
not a time to change."
   That doesn't mean there aren't some good long-term values
still to be found in sectors of the market that haven't run
up so wildly in price. But it does mean that this is no time
to chase a rally. "We're looking for a pretty sloppy market
where selectivity is crucial," says Michael Carty, a senior
portfolio manager at Value Line Asset Management Inc.
   For individuals willing to take the extra risk in stocks,
investment professionals offer widely varying suggestions.
   Perhaps the most popular recommendation is to play the
other side of the 1980s borrowing binge -- for instance, by
buying low-debt companies that have strong positions in
industries that are otherwise loaded down with debt.
   Such companies "are in a good position to both increase
market share and raise (profit) margins" as rivals weaken and
fall by the wayside, says Robert Raiff, managing director at
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. Some of these stocks
still sell at price-earnings multiples that look cheap
relative to their potential growth, he says. These include
American Airlines and Delta in the airline industry, and May
Department Stores and Liz Claiborne among retailers.
   For similar reasons, Eldon Mayer, chairman of Lynch &amp;
Mayer Inc., says large growth stocks could surprise skeptics
long-term, even though many pros view these stocks as
overpriced, after 18 months of strong performance. His
argument: Many of these companies' growth rates "are going to
increase rather than decelerate, because they are now
competing with companies that are overleveraged or have other
serious problems." He continues to like Wal-Mart Stores, Walt
Disney Co., Toys `R' Us and Microsoft, but would stay away
from McDonald's.
   Other strategists say to forget large stocks and go for
small and medium-sized growth stocks, which have been out of
favor with investors for so long that they look extremely
cheap.
   "On the stock side, value is really in the riskier area of
small growth," says Franklin Kennedy, senior vice president
at Equitable Capital Management Corp. As an overall strategy,
he recommends: "Be conservative in asset mix (by holding
bonds and cash) but very aggressive in the stock selection"
by investing in smaller technology and health-care issues.
   Still, other pros doubt that small growth stocks will
return to the limelight any time soon. "Smaller stocks appear
on balance to be cheaper, but really aren't," says First
Boston's Mr. Grigoli.
   Aside from worries about the illiquidity of such stocks,
he says, "my personal philosophy is to avoid them because
it's the really exciting opportunities overseas that will
fuel future earnings growth" among U.S. corporations, and
small stocks generally have little international exposure.
His advice is to stick with multinational companies in
industries such as drugs, health-care, foods, tobacco,
electrical equipment and computer systems.
   Robert Moseson, president of pension consultants
Performance Analytics Inc., says the fact that growth-stock
investing has become so broadly fashionable is a sure sign
that "there's a lot of greed out there now," and the market
is topping out.
   "The individual who owns growth stocks or mutual funds
should take profits and shift to value" -- such as low
price-earnings stocks or value-oriented funds, Mr. Moseson
says. By September, however, he advises being "as far away
from the equity market as possible" because the potential
returns will no longer justify the risk.
