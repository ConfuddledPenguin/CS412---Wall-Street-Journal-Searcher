   MUST STATES REFUND $2 billion they don't have to
federal-government retirees?
   In March 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court said Michigan had
taxed pensions of federal retirees unconstitutionally while
exempting those of state retirees -- but the court didn't say
whether the tax treatment must be equalized retroactively by
refunds or other action. So the 27 states potentially
affected waited to see the outcome of two cases involving
refunds of other unconstitutional state taxes. Two weeks ago,
the justices reached differing decisions in the two cases,
transmitting an ambiguous message to the states resisting
pension-tax refunds.

   The court has agreed to review another similar case, but
lawyers aren't sure that case can produce a definitive
ruling. Certainty may have to wait for refund suits to work
through state courts to the high court. South Carolina's
Supreme Court has rejected refunds; Missouri's has upheld
them. But New Mexico has just decided the U.S. Supreme Court
hasn't provided grounds for appealing a trial court's award
of refunds.
   Trial courts have granted refunds in four other states,
denied them in one.
                                                                                                       

   STATES FIND IT COSTLY to equalize taxes on federal and
state pensions.
   Refunds of past taxes still are at issue, but states
clearly had to equalize future taxes; 21 have done so. The
Federation of Tax Administrators, a state officials' group,
estimated that outright equalization could cut states'
revenue by $500 million a year; compromises have trimmed that
to $90 million. Four states have exempted federal pensions
fully, but 11 opted to end full exemption for state pensions
and to grant partial exemption to all government retirees.
   Three states increased state pensions to offset taxes
somewhat. But two others, New Mexico and Utah, dropped
state-retiree exemptions and now tax all retirement benefits.
Six generous states extended at least partial exemption to
all pensioners -- private and government. But one, Virginia,
cut back its exemptions this year after projecting that
revenue losses from its 1989 legislation would exceed $100
million in 1991; the projected loss now is about $60 million.
                                                                                                       

   IRS CRIME FIGHTERS will consider where to aim their
resources in the '90s.
   Half these resources long have gone into multi-agency
projects to nail organized-crime and drug figures; those
programs now include thrift-institution fraud. But total
resources have held steady at about 2,800 agents. The IRS and
others have questioned whether a larger share of them should
be investigating general tax crimes. In 1988, Congress's
General Accounting Office said IRS criminal enforcement
couldn't be evaluated because it didn't have specific goals.
   Now the IRS, the Treasury and the Justice Department are
forming a task force to study the allocation of these
resources. The group will meet for the first time late in
July to formulate purposes and methods. "We need a
broad-based study," says Assistant IRS Commissioner Morics.
In fiscal 1989, the IRS began 5,417 criminal inquiries, up
from 4,899 in 1988. Half the new cases, 2,709, involved drugs
and money-laundering, up from 1,430 in 1988.
   The group will seek comments from practitioners and
others, Morics says.
                                                                                                       

   HE NEVER LOST when he gambled, said Jerold Dean Kling of
Scottsbluff, Neb.; that's how he supported simultaneously his
wife and three children and his girlfriend and her children.
But the Tax Court agreed with the IRS that Kling embezzled a
taxable $95,000 in two years from the tire shop where he was
the manager.
                                                                                                       

   GENEROUS FOLKS often use charitable remainder trusts: They
set aside assets to go to charity when they die, but retain
trust income for their lifetimes. Now Revenue Procedures
90-30 through 90-33 describe 16 trust types that meet IRS
requirements; the IRS no longer will provide private rulings
on whether other forms qualify.
                                                                                                       

   VIRGINIA LANDLORDS can earn personal or corporate state
tax credits for 1991 through 1993 by reducing rents by at
least 15% for tenants who are disabled or over 62. The credit
will equal 50% of the reductions; the annual maximum will be
the lesser of $10,000 or the income tax due.
                                                                                                       

   TOUGHER TOOLS for collecting debts are sought by the 93
U.S. attorneys.
   These Justice Department officials say they are hampered
in collecting federal tax, loan and other delinquencies
because federal-court rules require them to operate under the
divergent collection laws of the states where they are
located. For example, says U.S. Attorney Wortham of Tyler,
Texas, five states don't permit garnishment of wages. Also,
he says, debtors in Texas and Florida can protect homesteads
"worth millions" from seizure, yet those in Idaho have no
homestead protection at all.
   The U.S. attorneys want to create uniform federal
collection rules to bypass the weaknesses in state laws. The
Senate adopted their bill last November. But at a House
Judiciary hearing last week, Robert Hobbs of the National
Consumer Law Center and Henry Sommer of Community Legal
Services of Philadelphia said many of the bill's measures are
far too harsh.
   Its garnishments could put families below the poverty
line, Hobbs said.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: The Senate Finance Committee plans a hearing June
27 on proposals to ease restrictions on "estate freezes" that
are used to hold down estate taxes when business ownership is
transferred within a family. . . . The House Ways and Means
Committee's 1,300-page compilation of tax-simplification
proposals is now available.
