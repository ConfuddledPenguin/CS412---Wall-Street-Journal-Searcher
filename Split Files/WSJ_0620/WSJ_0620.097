   CHICAGO -- Helene Curtis Industries Inc., its earnings
hurt by new-product spending and a strategy that seeks to
boost market share through price cuts, reported a fiscal
first-quarter loss, despite a 22% sales increase.
   For the quarter ended May 31, the maker of personal-care
products had a net loss of $1.8 million, or 20 cents a share,
compared with year-earlier net income of $2.2 million, or 24
cents a share. Sales rose to $195.1 million from $160.2
million.

   The company attributed much of the sales increase to the
recent introduction of its Degree antiperspirant/deodorant,
as well as "continued gains by our U.S. consumer brands and
strong performances by hair-care products in Japan and
Canada."
   Helene Curtis said its "strong" domestic business reflects
increased market share in hair-care products, and said the
more than 20% sales rise in its Suave line "underscores the
effectiveness of our strategy of lowering this brand's prices
by 10% last year to reinforce its position."
   The company said that, as it had projected, higher
marketing expenses and capital layouts aimed at boosting
manufacturing and distribution cut into earnings. And it
reiterated that it "will be difficult for us to match our
fiscal 1990 earnings performance in 1991."
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Helene Curtis shares dipped 50 cents to $25.125.
