   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks eased despite a mild
recovery on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Traders say OTC investors held back from buying stocks to
see if Monday's weakness would resume.

   But with OTC stocks registering only mild losses by the
session's end, some players are predicting that unlisted
share prices will recover today.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.26 point, or 0.06%,
to 460.53, while averages on the Big Board edged higher. The
NYSE Composite Index added 0.35%, while the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 0.39%.
   OTC advancers led decliners, 1,036 to 932, while total
Nasdaq volume eased to 143 million shares from Monday's 157.6
million shares.
   George Jennison, co-manager of OTC trading at Wheat
First-Butcher &amp; Singer, says there are still plenty of
portfolio managers with sideline cash itching to turn that
money into stocks before the second quarter ends. That buying
could support unlisted stock prices through the end of the
month, he says.
   "I think you're going to see a recovery in OTC stocks"
today, says Mr. Jennison.
   But after the end of the quarter, concern will probably
grow over how much money companies earned in the quarter, Mr.
Jennison says.
   Analysts warn that recent economic data showing a
continued weakness in the economy could translate into
falling profits at some companies.
   While that may not hurt those stocks for which investors
are already expecting an earnings decline, a slump could
devastate stocks for which investors are betting on a rise.
And thinly capitalized OTC stocks often react more
drastically than others when earnings don't come in on line.
   "High growth expectations leave you susceptible to
disappointments, especially in an environment where we seem
to be getting negative signals out of the data," cautions
Claudia Mott, small-stock analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities.
   She warns that apparel retailers may be the most
vulnerable this time around.
   Ms. Mott tracks earnings expectations for about 800 stocks
with market capitalizations of $50 million to $500 million.
   Apparel retailers top the list of groups in which
investors are betting on a sharp rise in profits, she says.
But falling retail sales may mean those expectations are too
high, she adds. Retail sales fell 0.4% in March, 0.4% in
April and 0.7% in May.
   And Ms. Mott notes that earnings for apparel retailers
weren't exactly stellar in the first quarter, making a sudden
leap in growth rates all that more unlikely.
   Among apparel retailers for which analysts are expecting a
big second-quarter earnings rise are Deb Shops, Paul Harris
Stores and Jay Jacobs, Ms. Mott says.
   According to Ms. Mott, analysts are expecting Deb Shops to
earn about 32 cents a share in the second quarter, up from
only six cents a share a year earlier.
   Paul Harris is expected to earn about five cents a share,
compared with two cents a share in last year's second
quarter, she says.
   And analysts are looking for Jay Jacobs to earn 10 cents a
share, more than double the four cents a share earned in the
year-earlier quarter, Ms. Mott says.
   Deb Shops slipped 1/4 to 11 5/8, this year's low for the
stock. Paul Harris, which didn't trade yesterday, trades at
about 4, and Jay Jacobs added 3/8 to 9 3/4.
   Ms. Mott says strong earnings growth is also expected for
some technology stocks, particularly those in
computer-related industries. The group already saw its
earnings turn around in the first quarter, however, making a
strong second-quarter a safer bet, she says.
   Meanwhile, earnings of companies in financial services or
basic industries have been slumping for some time, and
continued weakness should come as no surprise to shareholders
of those stocks.
   On the losers list, Gradco Systems dropped 1 1/2 to 9 1/2.
The company said it had a loss of $3.79 a share in its fourth
quarter ended in March, after taking a charge of about $23
million from the restructuring and consolidation of its
world-wide operations. Gradco earned 27 cents a share in the
year-earlier fourth quarter.
   Separately, Gradco said it expects to report a gain of
about $2.35 a share in the current second quarter from the
proceeds of a $26.5 million private placement in Japan.
   Software Toolworks recovered 1 1/2 of the 4 7/8 point loss
incurred Monday, ending yesterday's session at 20 1/2. The
stock fell in reaction to a bearish article in this week's
Barron's, leading some analysts to defend the company.
   Other OTC technology stocks that advanced include Oracle
Systems, up 5/8 to 23 1/8, and Microsoft, which added 1/8 to
75.
   Newport Pharmaceuticals surged 13/16 to 3 5/8, nearly a
29% rise for the stock. A study conducted by researchers in
Sweden and Denmark suggests that a controversial drug
developed by the company may delay the onset of AIDS in
people infected with the AIDS virus. The Food and Drug
Administration said, however, that other tests of the drug,
isoprinosine, don't support the findings.
   Handex Environmental fell 1 3/4 to 21 1/4. The company
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Monday for
a secondary offering of 750,000 common shares.
