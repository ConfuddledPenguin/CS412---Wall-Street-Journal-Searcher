   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Agriculture Committee voted to
spare the nation's dairy farmers from any further cuts in
dairy price supports over the next five years.
   The panel agreed to make the current milk support price --
$10.10 for each 100 pounds -- the five-year floor price for
milk producers. They would allow for adjustments in the
support price as government-owned dairy surpluses fluctuate
in size, but in no case could the support price fall below
$10.10.

   But committee members rebuffed their chairman, Democratic
Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, by voting to prohibit the
government from undertaking another massive buy-out of dairy
herds to control surpluses of butter and other dairy
products.
   Disenchantment with the $1.8 billion whole-herd buy-out in
the mid-1980s -- also known as the dairy termination program
-- was so great on the committee that even Democrats deserted
Sen. Leahy in the 16-2 vote yesterday. Only Republican Sen.
Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, a major dairy-farming state like
Vermont, took his side.
   The amendment was advanced by Sens. Max Baucus (D., Mont.)
and David Boren (D., Okla.), who both represent major beef
cattle-raising states, and it was strongly supported by the
National Cattlemen's Association and other farm groups.
