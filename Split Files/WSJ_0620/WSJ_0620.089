   MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Consolidated Freightways Inc.,
buffeted by continuing losses at its Emery Worldwide
air-freight unit, said it will suspend its quarterly dividend
as part of an agreement with lenders providing a new line of
credit of as much as $860 million.
   Consolidated said the five-year agreement permits it to
reinstate its 26.5-cent-a-share payout "subject to meeting
certain performance standards." A spokesman declined to say
how soon that might be; Consolidated was scheduled to pay its
next dividend after the second quarter.

   The trucking and air-freight company had gone nine years
without a quarterly deficit until its $230 million
acquisition of loss-plagued Emery last year; Consolidated
also agreed to take on about $240 million in Emery debt.
   Hurt by a slump in its own business and
higher-than-anticipated losses at Emery, Consolidated
reported a fourth-quarter loss of $32.3 million, or $1.01 a
share, on revenue of $991.3 million. In the first quarter,
its loss widened to $33.9 million, or $1.06 a share, on
revenue of $997.7 million.
   Consolidated said that although losses at Emery have
narrowed in recent months, "Emery's long-term prospects are
dependent on substantially increased business levels." At the
time of its acquisition, Emery, battered by stiffening
competition in the international air-freight market, had
three consecutive years of losses. Consolidated viewed the
purchase as central to its strategy to compete in the global
freight-hauling business.
