   GORBACHEV ENDORSED a separate Communist Party in the
Russian republic.
   But the Soviet president assailed those who want to make
the new party a separatist force in Russia, largest of the 15
Soviet republics. The impetus for Gorbachev's reluctant
endorsement of the separate party, announced at a conference
of Russian Communists in Moscow, is the emergence of rival
Boris Yeltsin as the new president of the Russian Federation.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is considering participating in a $20
billion international rescue effort for the Soviet economy.

   A HOUSE PANEL CLEARED an amendment barring desecration of
the flag.
   The Judiciary Committee sent the proposed constitutional
amendment protecting the flag to the full House without
recommendation, signaling possible difficulties for the
measure in a floor vote that could come as early as tomorrow.
The 19-17 vote surprised some panel members, who had
predicted a favorable recommendation. The amendment was
proposed by Bush last week after the Supreme Court overturned
a law banning flag desecration, saying it violated freedom of
speech.
   The amendment would have to be passed by a two-thirds
majority in Congress and then approved by legislatures in at
least 38 of the 50 states.

Mandela was to fly to New York today.
