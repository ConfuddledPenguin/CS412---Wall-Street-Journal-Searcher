   Adolph Coors Co. violated Colorado water law by
discharging contaminated groundwater into nearby streams
without a permit and without notifying state water
authorities, the Colorado Department of Health's Water
Quality Control Division said.
   According to the agency, groundwater contaminated with
organic chemicals, including one probable carcinogen, were
released from a well under the company's can plant into Clear
Creek, a source of water for five municipalities, from 1982
to 1985.

   In addition, groundwater contaminated with a petrochemical
compound was released into the drainage from 1978 to 1989
from another site near the plant, the agency said.
   The discharges stopped when Coors began treating the
contaminated groundwater in its own treatment plant. But that
also was a violation of state law, says the water agency,
because the company didn't get a permit to treat water with
those chemicals.
   The violations carry fines of as much as $10,000 daily,
and Coors's illegal discharges continued for more than 4,000
days. Daily fines are usually levied in contamination cases
of much shorter duration, said David Holm, director of the
state's water quality division. He said he couldn't estimate
what the fine for Coors ultimately might be.
   Although no fish kills or other visible impact from the
pollution was recorded in Clear Creek during the discharges,
"there were very likely days when contaminants would have
exceeded water quality standards," said Mr. Holm.
   Sandra Woods, Coors vice president, environmental affairs,
said the company doesn't believe the contamination ever
presented a risk to consumers, employees or Coors's
neighbors. She added that the company is certain that no
contaminants from the polluted groundwater ended up in the
beer. Although traces of trichlorethane, a non-carcinogen,
were found in some of the brewing water at the time of the
discovery, the amounts were far below government standards.
The water quality division said it "is highly unlikely that
such chemicals would have survived the brewing process."
   The state agency and the company will begin negotiations
soon to determine what penalties should be levied. If an
agreement isn't reached in informal talks, a formal hearing
will be set, Mr. Holm said. Ms. Woods said she thinks the
matter will be resolved within 30 days, and the penalties
"will be very fair to Coors."
