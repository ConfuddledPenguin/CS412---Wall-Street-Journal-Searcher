   Gold King Consolidated Inc. said it poured its first gold
and silver from the Adelaide Crown mine in Humboldt County,
Nev. It said the mine is expected to produce about 20,000
ounces of gold a year.
   The Denver-based company said studies indicate that the
Adelaide Crown property, which it is leasing from Icarus
Exploration Co., has proven reserves of 585,000 tons of ore
with a grade of 0.043 ounce per ton of gold and 1.313 ounces
per ton of silver in one partially developed open pit mine on
the property.
