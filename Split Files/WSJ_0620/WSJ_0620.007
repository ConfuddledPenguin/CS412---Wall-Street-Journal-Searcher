   TOKYO -- Japanese shipbuilders signed contracts to export
35 vessels weighing a total of 1,389,000 metric tons in May,
up 132% by weight from a year earlier, the Japan Ship
Exporters' Association reported.
   The total gross tonnage was pushed up widely because of
increases in contracts for mid-sized or larger vessels, an
official of the association said.
