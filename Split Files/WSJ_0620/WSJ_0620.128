   LOS ANGELES -- Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. sued an insurer for
allegedly refusing to pay for its defense against a flurry of
investor lawsuits filed this year.
   In a complaint filed in state court in Los Angeles,
Saatchi asserts that a directors' and officers' liability
policy issued by New Hampshire Insurance Co. provides for
payment of defense costs of the suits now pending in federal
court in Los Angeles but that the insurer has declined
payment.

   The suits, filed by holders of Saatchi's American
depositary receipts, allege that Saatchi and its officers
artificially inflated the market price of the receipts, which
represent shares in London-based Saatchi, and that they
failed to disclose the giant advertising firm's difficulties
in digesting a series of acquisitions.
   Saatchi's suit seeks a declaration that New Hampshire
Insurance must pay for defense of the investor suits and asks
at least $100,000 in damages.
   Officials of New Hampshire Insurance, based in Manchester,
N.H., couldn't be reached for comment.
