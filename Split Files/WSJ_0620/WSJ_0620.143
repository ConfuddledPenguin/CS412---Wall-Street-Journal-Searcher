   Charter Consolidated PLC, a British industrial holding
concern, said pretax profit for the year ended March 31 rose
12% to #75.8 million ($129.9 million) from #67.7 million a
year earlier, as strong gains in its core mining and
industrial equipment activities offset a 24% lower
contribution from its 38% stake in the precious minerals
group Johnson Matthey PLC.
   Profit after taxes and minority interests rose 1.5% to
#46.1 million from #45.4 million. Earnings per share edged up
1.2% to 43.6 pence from 43.1 pence. After-tax earnings were
damped by a sharp rise in tax charges to #23.7 million from
#17.4 million paid in fiscal 1989, when the group benefited
from tax losses and deferred-tax credits. Net profit
attributable to shareholders after one-time gains increased
12% to #51.8 million from #46.3 million.

   Sales rose 2% to #1.03 billion from #1.01 billion.
   An extraordinary gain of #5.7 million is chiefly the
balance of a #24.4 million profit on the sale of a
stockholding and a #20.6 million write-off on Johnson
Matthey's restructuring program. A year earlier, the company
had a one-time gain of #900,000.
