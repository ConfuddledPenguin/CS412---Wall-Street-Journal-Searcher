   PALMDALE, Calif. -- Northrop Corp. executives and Air
Force brass invited reporters inside the B-2 Stealth bomber
factory here for the first time, underscoring how nervous
they are about congressional efforts to kill the plane.
   The balcony viewing of the shop floor, where dozens of
workers were scurrying to complete four of the manta-shaped
aircraft, was preceded by a two-hour briefing, where the
press was implored, in the words of Gen. Richard Scofield,
"to tell the whole story."

   But that plea, essentially to stop focusing on the
Stealth's enormous price tag and instead to acknowledge the
technological advances made on the program, remains a hard
sell to many lawmakers.
   "This plane is going to bankrupt America," Rep. John
Kasich (R., Ohio) said in an interview. Were Northrop to
build all 75 B-2s being sought now by the Pentagon, they
would cost more than $800 million each.
   Rep. Kasich has proposed a measure that would mothball the
tooling for the B-2 after only 16 planes are built. He said
he now has more than 200 supporters for that plan; the bill
needs 218 to pass the House.
   "Sure, it's got me worried," Ollie Boileau, president and
general manager of Northrop's B-2 division, said of the
effort. Gen. William Davitte, special assistant for strategic
modernization, said that other attempts brewing to put the
B-2 on the shelf for a year, while more testing is done, are
nothing more than "a euphemism for killing out the program."
   Yesterday's media circus provided little, if any, new
information about the B-2. Patriotic slogans were easily
tossed about. Tendentious explanations of why the nation
needs a manned, penetrating bomber were provided. But mostly
the gathering was a chance for the project's champions to
rebut criticism of the plane point by point.
   Kent Kresa, Northrop's chief executive, shot down
arguments that the Stealth is easily detected by certain
kinds of radar. He said more than 40 concepts have been
devised to foil Stealth technology but still "we're no closer
to defeating Stealth today than when the original concept was
proposed" more than a decade ago.
   In fact, it was asserted that trying to find the B-2 on a
radar screen would be as tough as trying to pick out someone
you know in the Rose Bowl, when it is filled, with the lights
out, and all you have is a flashlight.
   Gen. Davitte defended the B-2's mission, both strategic
and conventional. He likened the plane to Bo Jackson, the
multisport athlete, maintaining that the Stealth can do many
things well. But all of its roles, he said, have one
underlying goal: nuclear deterrence.
   Northrop officials also reiterated the manufacturing
advances the B-2 has inspired, especially with computer-aided
design. These techniques, they said, slowly are filtering to
other aerospace companies, and into other industries as well.
And they hailed the Stealth's 16 flight tests so far,
totaling more than 67 hours in the air, as a success.
   The one-million-square-foot final assembly area, Building
401, is itself impressive. Huge B-2 parts are hauled in by
C-5 cargo planes from LTV Corp., Boeing Co. and other major
subcontractors. The fuselage and wing sections are then
joined, though there is hardly any riveting needed on the
high-tech composite parts. At its peak, the factory could
handle more than a dozen planes at once.
   But, admittedly for the officials who hope to reach that
number, cost remains a sticking point. Indeed, one of the
more compelling reasons for making all 75 B-2s is a
paradoxical one: lots of money already has been sunk into the
program, including $1.2 billion out of Northrop's own pocket.
   Gen. Scofield, in what is becoming an oft-repeated
argument, said it would cost about $35 billion to shut down
the program early and wind up with an ineffective fleet of 15
B-2s. To get 75 planes, he maintained, the figure only goes
up to about $62 billion.
   The Air Force, which has been criticized for keeping
details about the B-2 classified for too long, apparently
will try to do better on one of its other costly planes, the
Advanced Tactical Fighter. On Friday, Northrop and team
member McDonnell Douglas Corp. will roll out their version of
the jet at Edwards Air Force Base, and top program officials
will be on hand to answer questions.
