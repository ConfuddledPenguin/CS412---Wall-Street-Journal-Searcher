   CHICAGO -- A federal grand jury indicted Michael S.
Douglas of Antioch, Ill., for allegedly selling unregistered
securities and defrauding more than 300 investors of millions
of dollars.
   Mr. Douglas, 37 years old, who the indictment says failed
to disclose to investors that he has twice been convicted in
Illinois for theft and deceptive practices, collected about
$45 million from investors between 1987 and late 1989 by
selling securities and other market instruments through three
trading companies he controlled.

   The limited partnership interests he offered to investors
constituted securities under federal law, the indictment
says, and thus should have been registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Mr. Douglas is charged with misrepresenting to investors
in at least eight states the actual investment strategy of
the limited partnerships he offered through his company, D&amp;S
Trading Group Ltd.
   Mr. Douglas also told investors D&amp;S had historical returns
of between 10% and 25% on a monthly basis, but those returns
were "invented," according to the indictment. Mr. Douglas
also calculated his share of the purported profit and a
management fee on the basis of profit that was "frequently
nonexistent or grossly inflated," the grand jury said.
   When the SEC began investigating D&amp;S Trading, Mr. Douglas
established a second company, Analytic Trading Systems Inc.,
to prevent discovery of the scheme, according to the
indictment. He subsequently established a third company,
Analytic Trading Service Inc., for the same reason, the
indictment says.
   Federal prosecutors said they haven't determined how much
of the investors' money had been pocketed and how much
remains available. Mr. Douglas's companies are currently
being liquidated.
   Mr. Douglas, who is being held pending a hearing scheduled
for tomorrow, didn't enter a plea yesterday.
