   Woolworth Corp. executives think they've seen the future
-- and it's in East Germany.
   The New York-based retailer, which already operates 286
stores in West Germany, expects to become the first American
company to open general merchandise stores in East Germany,
where it had business before World War II.

   "We think we'll have a couple of {stores} open before the
end of this year," said Harold Sells, Woolworth's chairman
and chief executive officer, in an interview. "This will give
us a good test of the market," he added, "and enable us to
move rapidly in 1991," perhaps with another eight to 10
stores.
   "East Germany will be our No. 1 priority," Mr. Sells said,
adding that the company also is considering opening Foot
Locker athletic shoe stores and Rubin jewelry stores there,
as it has in West Germany. Woolworth also sees opportunities
in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but isn't likely to seriously
consider entering those countries for at least a year, the
executive predicted.
   Woolworth, of course, isn't alone in looking behind the
crumbling Iron Curtain. U.S. marketers of everything from
fast food to jeans are attempting to capture the hearts --
and buying potential -- of Eastern Bloc consumers. McDonald's
Corp. and Estee Lauder cosmetics already have opened shops in
the Soviet Union. Bloomingdale's is in talks about opening
two Bloomie's Express airport shops in Moscow. And like
Woolworth, Toys "R" Us Inc. wants to open stores in East
Germany, although Joseph Baczko, president of the company's
international division, says: "There are a number of issues
that are still up in the air. I don't anticipate that
anything will happen in the next 12 months."
   But the fall of the Berlin Wall and next month's monetary
union of East and West Germany hold special significance for
Woolworth. It opened its first German "25 and 50 pfennig"
store -- the equivalent of a 5 and 10 -- under the Woolworth
name in Bremen in 1927. By the 1940s, the company operated
more than 30 stores in what became East Germany and Poland.
But, after World War II, the Communists seized them and
turned them into state-run outlets. Woolworth was never
compensated for its loss.
   The company is pursuing its claim on the properties, but
its store-opening plans don't depend on the outcome. "We're
going to open new stores, regardless of whether we get the
former locations back," Mr. Sells said. "We think it's a very
attractive market."
   It's also a risky one. The East German government itself
is predicting that 15% to 50% of its workers could lose their
jobs as the nation lurches toward capitalism. And many East
Germans are openly fretting about how much their spending
power will lag behind that of their West German cousins.
   Mr. Sells acknowledged that the approximately 16 million
East Germans are in for a tough transition. But, "we think
we're in a better position than any other U.S. retailer," he
said. "The older generation remembers Woolworth. They
recognize Woolworth being a store for value and one they can
afford."
   Woolworth stores in Germany, like those in the U.S., carry
low-priced snacks and household supplies. But they also carry
more apparel at higher prices than Woolworth outlets in the
U.S.
   Mr. Sells said the company is encouraged by the results of
its German stores near the Eastern border. In the euphoric
first week of free travel to the West last November, East
German consumers swamped the 30 or so nearby Woolworth
locations, Mr. Sells noted. They snapped up candy, peanuts,
toiletries and small computers, doubling year-earlier sales
tallies at many of the stores.
   The first wave of shopping was helped by a West German
government handout of roughly $55 for each East German. Even
so, Mr. Sells said sales at the border stores remain strong.
"We've continued very strong double-digit gains almost every
week since then," he said.
   In the current fiscal year, he said he expects sales to
East Germans to boost the West German unit's sales by an
additional 2% or 3%. The West German operation last year rang
up sales of $1.13 billion, or roughly 13% of Woolworth's
total revenue of $8.82 billion.
