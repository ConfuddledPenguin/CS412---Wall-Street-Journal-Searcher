   NEW YORK -- When applied to bonds, the term "high yield"
meant junk. Does it mean the same thing when applied to bank
stocks?
   Shares of three New York City banking giants have been
beaten down so much in recent weeks that their dividends have
hit the stratosphere, posing a tempting speculation for
investors. Wall Street analysts are starting to talk about
the "high-yield" banks, what with Chase Manhattan and
Chemical Banking yielding more than 10% and Manufacturers
Hanover a shade over 9%.

   By just about any measure, those yields are at historic
highs. Chase and Chemical, for example, are yielding almost
seven percentage points more than the stocks in the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index. Big banks in general offer higher yields
relative to the S&amp;P 500 than at any time in the past 20
years.
   You can get a higher yield buying the stock of one of
these three banks than you can by buying a certificate of
deposit from them. (Their one-year CDs are yielding between
8% and 8.5%.)
   As always, there's a catch. The stocks of these banks have
been driven down by fears of future losses from the current
unholy trinity of bank lending: real estate, highly leveraged
transactions, and loans to less-developed countries. If there
are further big losses lurking in the loan portfolios of the
banks, their stocks could fall even more, wiping out some of
the dividend return.
   "Yields wouldn't be this high if there weren't concern
about the dividend being cut," says Cheryl Swaim, a bank
analyst at Oppenheimer.
   "There must be a number of investors who believe the
dividends aren't safe under current economic conditions or
that federal regulators will change the rules under which
they can pay those dividends," says Mark Alpert, a bank
analyst at Bear Stearns.
   In fact, bank regulators already have proposed new rules
restricting dividend payments by banks. But Mr. Alpert and
many other Wall Street analysts believe that dividends at the
major New York banks are safe, though he isn't expecting big
dividend increases in the next year or so.
   Others, however, argue that the stock market is correctly
pricing bank stocks to reflect the possibility of a dividend
cut. Among the more vocal in this camp is James Grant, editor
of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a longtime Cassandra
about the leveraging of America.
   "Chase and Chemical are right up there in the rankings of
banks committed to real estate, HLTs {highly leveraged
transactions} and Third World loans," says Mr. Grant. He says
he has sold short "a bourgeois amount" of Chemical stock,
hoping that the price will fall so he can buy back the stock
at a lower price.
   Mr. Grant isn't flatly predicting dividend cuts, but he
says the dividend rules proposed by the Federal Reserve Board
and the comptroller of the currency would make the payouts
less secure. The rules would significantly tighten the
restrictions on dividends that banks can pay to their parent
holding companies.
   In essence, both the current and proposed rules say that
banks can't pay out more in dividends than they earn in
profits. The new rules, however, would change the way profits
are calculated.
   In the past, provisions for anticipated future loan losses
weren't deducted from earnings as regulators figured them;
only the actual "charge-offs" were deducted. But when banking
companies report earnings to shareholders and the Securities
and Exchange Commission, provisions for loan losses are
deducted from earnings as soon as the provisions are made.
The regulators' new proposal would align the regulatory
accounting practices with SEC's. Had the rule been in place
in recent years, it could have severely reduced the banks'
dividends.
   Two aspects of the proposed rules work in favor of the big
bank holding companies, Mr. Alpert notes. First, the
proposals would apply only to banks, not their parent holding
companies, which actually pay the dividends to shareholders.
Even if one bank within a holding company had to cut its
payments to its parent, the parent could continue to pay
dividends with profits from other subsidiaries.
   Second, the rules wouldn't take effect until 1991, and
wouldn't force banks to recalculate their earnings for prior
years. That's important, because under both the current and
proposed rules, banks are allowed to pay dividends equal to
their current-year profits plus any retained earnings from
the previous two years. So the banks won't have to slash the
cushion obtained from 1989 and 1990 earnings figured under
the existing, less-stringent rules.
   The three "high-yield" banking companies express slightly
varying degrees of confidence in their dividends.
   Manufacturers Hanover believes its dividend is safe, a
spokesman says. He notes that the company's board yesterday
declared a regular quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share.
The spokesman said Manufacturers Hanover doesn't "see any
increases in the dividend in the near term," but added: "We
do not expect the new rules {by regulators} to have any
impact on our ability to pay the dividend."
   Chase Manhattan "doesn't foresee any problem maintaining
our dividend at our current level," a spokesman says. In a
recent filing with the SEC, Chase said the ability of its
largest bank subsidiary to pay dividends to the parent "is
likely to be severely impacted" under both current and
proposed rules. But, it added, "management expects the
company to continue to pay dividends on its preferred and
common stock from other sources," such as dividends from
other operating units.
   At Chemical, "we simply, as a matter of policy, don't
speculate about our dividend going forward," a spokesman
said. The spokesman pointed to a paragraph in Chemical's most
recent annual report saying that under current rules,
Chemical's bank subsidiaries could pay $459 million in
dividends in 1990, plus an amount equal to the units' 1990
profits. At current levels, Chemical pays $330 million a year
in dividends. Though the Chemical report describes the
regulators' proposed changes, it doesn't say how Chemical
might be affected.
   Bear Stearns's Mr. Alpert says Manufacturers Hanover has
the best balance sheet of the three but has "limited revenue
growth prospects." Chase, which is considering its second
restructuring in two years, "looks to be the most out of
control," he says. And Chemical is "the darkest horse among
the money center banks," with an attractive branch system
despite still-high levels of non-performing loans in Texas
and New Jersey.
