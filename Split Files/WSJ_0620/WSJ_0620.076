   Responding to a U.S. Supreme Court decision issued last
week, a private psychiatric hospital in Rye, N.Y., proceeded
with a suit seeking more money from the state for Medicaid
services.
   Rye Psychiatric Hospital Center, a private 41-bed
psychiatric facility, is alleging that the state Office of
Mental Health and Department of Social Services violated a
provision of the Medicaid law that requires states to provide
Medicaid reimbursement rates that are "reasonable and
adequate" for efficient medical care. Rye has also sued the
federal government, which approved the state's reimbursement
plan.

   The lawsuit is believed to be the first filed by a private
psychiatric facility over Medicaid reimbursements. Rye filed
the suit in federal court in White Plains, N.Y., two years
ago but the suit wasn't pursued pending the outcome of the
Supreme Court case.
   In last week's decision (Wilder vs. Virginia Hospital
Association), the Supreme Court ruled that hospitals and
nursing homes may sue state officials under federal law to
force them to provide adequate reimbursement for Medicaid
services.
   The Supreme Court decision is expected to force many
states to increase payments to hospitals and nursing-home
services. Hospitals around the country say they have been
hurt by states' efforts to control rising health care costs.
The hospitals complain that states have set reimbursement
rates so low that providers lose money on Medicaid patients.
Medicaid aids women and children and elderly nursing-home
patients.
   Rye's suit focuses on a state regulation that applies
solely to private psychiatric hospitals. Under that
regulation, the hospitals receive lower Medicaid rates if
their occupancy level falls below 75%. Rye's occupancy rate
runs between 55% and 65%, said Dr. Jack C. Schoenholtz, the
hospital's medical director.
   Dr. Schoenholtz said that the formula unfairly penalizes
the hospital because it does not take into account the
patients' length of stay or the fact that the hospital admits
a disproportionate share of low-income patients with special
needs. In 1989, Rye patients remained in the hospital 36 days
on average, among the lowest of the state's 13 private
psychiatric hospitals, he said.
   "It is an industrywide practice to penalize a hospital
that does not have a high occupancy rate. It's used to
encourage health care providers to take down beds for which
they have a license but which they do not use," said Pamela
Tindall-O'Brien, assistant counsel for the state Office of
Mental Health, which sets Medicaid rates for the state's
private mental health care providers.
   Both sides have asked the judge to rule in their favor
without a trial.

   MARCOS PROSECUTION rests its case in federal racketeering
trial.
   The U.S. Attorney's office concluded its case against
Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, 11
weeks into the trial. Attorneys for Mrs. Marcos and
co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi said they plan to call no
witnesses on their clients' behalf. Closing arguments in the
case are scheduled to begin Monday, following two days of
procedural hearings this week.
   Mrs. Marcos, facing four counts of racketeering, fraud,
conspiracy and obstruction of justice, is accused of
plundering the Philippines and illegally using the money to
buy artwork, real estate and jewelry in the U.S. On trial
along with her in federal court in Manhattan is Mr.
Khashoggi, a Saudi financier accused of helping Mrs. Marcos
hide her ownership of Manhattan real estate.
   "It's our view that the government has utterly failed in
this case," said Gerry Spence, Mrs. Marcos's attorney. "You
only call witnesses when you have a case to rebut."
   When the trial began, Mr. Spence promised to call a wide
range of witnesses, including President George Bush and a
witness in the Philippines who claimed to have helped Mrs.
Marcos's late husband discover a hoard of gold. Mr. Spence
has said that the gold -- a legendary treasure supposedly
hidden by a Japanese general during World War II -- accounted
for the Marcoses' wealth. Mr. Marcos, who was ousted as
president of the Philippines in 1986 and came to the U.S.,
died last September.
   Prosecutors called nearly 100 witnesses, including
Philippine National Bank officials, who testified that secret
accounts were set up by Mr. Marcos and that government money
was used in personal spending by the Marcos family.
   Mrs. Marcos's attorneys maintained that the spending was
for legitimate government expenses, and that Mrs. Marcos knew
nothing about the alleged theft and fraud.

   INDUSTRIAL PIPE companies settle price-fixing case for
$5.2 million.
   In Houston, U.S. District Judge Norman W. Black approved
the agreement with 14 pipe manufacturers and suppliers named
as defendants in a class action lawsuit. The civil suit was
brought on behalf of hundreds of businesses that bought pipe
used in paper mills, nuclear plants and oil refineries.
   Filed in late 1988, the suit alleged that the defendants
violated federal antitrust laws by conspiring to overcharge
customers between January 1966 and December 1985. Allegations
against 12 other defendants still are pending, but a trial
date hasn't been set.
   The charges parallel those spelled out in a number of
earlier criminal antitrust actions brought by the U.S.
Justice Department. Most of those government actions have
been resolved, a Justice Department spokesman said.
   Agreeing to pay varying amounts of the $5.2 million civil
settlement were Bear Tubular Steel; Benjamin F. Shaw Co. and
its parent Blount Inc.; Guyon Alloys; ITT Fluid Products
Corp.; Louis Canuso Inc.; Mannesmann International Alloys
Inc.; Newman Flange &amp; Fitting Co.; Pipe Fabricating &amp; Supply
Co.; Power Piping Co.; Ram Forge & Steel; Tad U.S.A. Steel
Pipe Fittings; U.S. Metals; and W.F.I. International.
   ITT Fluid will pay the largest portion at $1.4 million;
Guyon and Mannesmann are each paying at least $800,000.

   CALIFORNIA LAW will close court hearings where trade
secrets are at issue.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law a bill
that allows closed state court hearings in cases where there
is a "substantial probability" that trade secrets might be
disclosed. A caveat of the law, however, is that owners of
the secret must be able to show that harm from disclosure
outweighs any "overriding public interest" in making
information public.
   The bill is aimed at stemming piracy in the state's huge
computer and high-technology industry. The purpose is to
close a perceived loophole in criminal court procedures that
has resulted in defendants in trade-secrets theft cases
avoiding prosecution by threatening to reveal the very
secrets they allegedly stole.
   "You're a pirate; you steal it, then you say, `Okay,
prosecute me. But if you do, I'll recite the secret in open
court, or I'll put it in depositions where it becomes a
matter of public record,'" said a spokesman for Chuck
Quackenbush, the California legislator who sponsored the
bill. Many companies, faced with that dilemma, have decided
not to prosecute when faced with the risk of widespread
dissemination of their property rights, he said.
   The law doesn't set fines or penalties for disclosure of
such secrets in court, but establishes a mechanism by which
proceedings can be closed upon probable cause that a secret
may be revealed.

   JUDGE FINALIZES RULING that Amoco is liable in oil spill.
   Amoco Corp. will appeal the ruling that it must pay about
$160 million in damages related to a 1978 oil spill.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Charles R. Norgle
relates to suits brought against Amoco by various French
entities and Shell Oil Co., following a spill by the Amoco
Cadiz supertanker of more than 68 million gallons of oil
along the coast of France. Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch
Petroleum Co., owned the ship's cargo.
   The case was originally heard by Frank J. McGarr, a
federal judge who later sitting as special master
preliminarily decided its outcome.
   Amoco said that in addition to appealing, it will seek to
have responsibility for payment of the damage awards passed
on to the builder of the Cadiz, Astilleros Espanoles S.A., of
Spain.
   It was also ruled that Astilleros was liable for design
and construction flaws that contributed to the accident in
which the 1,095-foot tanker ran aground. The court has not
yet set the amount of damages to be paid by the company.
   A spokesman for Amoco said insurance coverage, reserves
and a damage fund set up in 1978 will negate any "material
adverse affect to the company."
