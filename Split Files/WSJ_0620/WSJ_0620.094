   Motorola Inc. said a federal court in Washington, D.C.,
granted a temporary stay of an injunction that would have
forced the company to stop selling a popular computer chip
that a lower court found to infringe on Hitachi Ltd. patents.
   Motorola requested the stay soon after a federal judge in
Austin, Texas, entered an order to impose a March ruling that
called for Motorola to stop selling its 68030 chip. In the
March ruling, the Austin judge issued an injunction ordering
Motorola and Hitachi to stop making chips that were found to
infringe on each others' patents.

   The judge later granted a stay of the injunction, urging
the two to settle the matter out of court. In his order to
lift the stay of injunction, the Austin judge explained that
"the parties have chosen not to forge a settlement in the
interim, and this court is not inclined to continue its
indulgence."
   If enforced, the Austin injunction against the Motorola
chip, one of its hottest sellers, could have hurt computer
makers, such as Apple Computer Inc., that use the chip.
Hitachi wouldn't have been hurt much because it sells few of
the disputed chips in the U.S.
   Motorola said it will file a formal appeal of the Austin
judge's decision in the Washington court by June 22. Motorola
and Hitachi said they were continuing negotiations to settle
the 18-month patent dispute out of court. "Our No. 1 task is
to reach a settlement" through negotiation, said a Hitachi
spokesman.
   The ruling is the latest twist in an 18-month
trans-Pacific patent battle, started by Motorola, in which
Motorola and Hitachi have launched a barrage of suits and
countersuits.
   Motorola had said Monday that the U.S. Patent Office
agreed last week to re-examine Hitachi's patent, which
Motorola claims is invalid on the basis of a 1966 patent. The
patent office has found that "a substantial new question
about (the) Hitachi patent has been raised which has a direct
bearing on the outcome of this case," Motorola said.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Motorola shares fell 87.5 cents apiece to close at $85, while
Hitachi American Depository Receipts fell 62.5 cents apiece
to close at $98.50.
