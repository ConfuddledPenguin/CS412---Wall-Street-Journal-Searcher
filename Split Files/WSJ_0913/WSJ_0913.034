   BEEF'S BACK with a new image and higher price. But some
cry fowl.
   Leaner steaks and meaner advertising help boost red meat's
image as beef cattle prices hit a record 75.4 cents a pound
in August. Economists say prices are higher even than tight
supplies warrant; some suspect a change in consumer tastes,
encouraged by ads touting trim cuts to counter cholesterol,
calorie concerns. "There's a different attitude about beef,"
says Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst at Shearson Lehman
Brothers. Perhaps. But a spokesman for Dominick's Finer Foods
Inc., Chicago, notes: "The trend is still away from red meat
and towards poultry and seafood."

   Chicken's still the top seller, but it may be bumped due
to a technicality next year. Starting in 1991, the
Agriculture Department will tighten up its formula for
subtracting nonessential bird parts like bones and organs
from consumption data. Still, beef's comeback may be
short-lived if a recession hits and consumers switch to
cheaper meats. Supply may also be a problem -- at any price.
In 1989, the nation's herd shrank to its smallest numbers
since 1961, and ranchers remain leery about expanding.
   Beefed up, but still down: Per capita beef consumption may
slip another two pounds this year to about 67 pounds.
                                                                                                       

   TAKE A LETTER. Service firms pick up the pen for lazy
correspondents.
   Action Write Now], a Farmingdale, N.Y., direct-mail firm,
expands with customized letters for lobbying groups big and
small. For about $4 a letter or $11 for a mini-campaign, it
digs up legislator addresses, fires up the laser printers and
signs with script. Options: real stamps, telegram stationery.
In Boston, WordRight offers daily writing tips over its
900-number. "You know how people are about writing, they're
afraid of it," says Susan Benjamin, president, adding: "I
have a woman who calls me up for memos." A WordRight call
costs $2 a minute; related instructional audio tapes are
$11.95 each. Is MathRight next?
   As for social correspondence, greeting card companies try
to thaw writers' block with hot products. American Greetings
offers Anytime Cards and tests a back-to-school theme;
Hallmark's "Just How I Feel" line notes "all sorts of
personal feelings and relationships." Not everyone approves.
Don't even think of sending storebought thank-you cards, says
Judith Martin, who writes as "Miss Manners," noting they're
more costly and "a lot less charming." And matters of the
heart? "If you've ever been in love and kissed a signature,
you know that the person who actually wrote it makes a big
difference," she says.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. QUALITY gets better. But pricing, innovation problems
loom.
   Improvements to American goods grow, but cost
efficiencies, new-product gains don't, says the Boston
University School of Management Manufacturing Roundtable. Its
latest survey finds quality improved at an annual rate of 7%,
up from under 6% in the 1988 survey. But cost and new-product
introduction gains were flat at 2% to 3%, trailing Japan.
"Americans caught on to quality" but "aren't addressing the
other issues with equal fervor," says Jeffrey Miller, author.
   The survey of some 200 manufacturers also identified
several major obstacles facing U.S. manufacturers, including
a lack of shared vision within companies; misaligned
performance and incentive measures; poorly educated workers;
environmental regulations and lack of trust by suppliers.
   More than half say they begin product manufucturing
feasibility tests only after most of the design work is done.
                                                                                                       

   TAKING THE LOW ROAD: Travel Agent magazine offers this tip
on minimizing damage done to the cruise industry by the
Mideast crisis: "Americans are notorious for their poor sense
of geography, and that is a greater threat to agents than
bullets and rising oil prices combined." The article suggests
displaying large maps.
                                                                                                       

   NO BRAINS NEEDED. The USDA says exports of edible innards
like kidneys, livers and hearts are likely to shrink by
two-thirds to $30 million in 1990, due largely to Europe's
ban on meats with hormones.
                                                                                                       

   MORE IN HAND. Men's ties are wider (by about a half-inch),
bolder (especially florals) and pricier (up $5 or so) than
last year, says an NBO Stores Inc. survey.
                                                                                                       

   DEBT COLLECTION firms may flash a warning light on
approaching recession.
   When claims spurt and collections shrink, bill collectors
start talking recession. "We certainly are starting to see
some signs," says Les Kirschbaum, president of Mid-Continent
Agencies Inc., Glenview, Ill. He says claims jumped 15% in
August and continue at that pace so far this month.
Previously, claims were growing 8% to 9%. Meanwhile,
collectibility is slowing, although not dramatically. Still,
if the trend continues, chances of a recession accelerate, he
says.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet chief economist Joseph Duncan cautions
that collectibility ratios are far from perfect predictors.
For one thing, companies in deep trouble sometimes pay bills
"early so stress doesn't show on the balance sheet," he says.
Separately, Mr. Duncan notes early readings on Dun's business
expectations survey "show a sharp weakening in business
optimism."
   A growing trend: Asking old customers for new financial
data to better assess their ability to pay for orders.
