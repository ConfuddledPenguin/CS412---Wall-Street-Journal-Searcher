   NEW YORK -- Investors shrugged off potentially unsettling
Middle East news and pushed stock prices higher in a
last-minute rally.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.12 points
higher at 2625.74. Volume was light most of the day but
picked up in the final hour. Bond prices edged lower in
continued light trading. The dollar hit a 13-month low
against the yen but was higher against the mark.

   Stocks' late surge, said Christopher Pedersen, director of
trading at Twenty-First Securities, was sparked by a news
service report about an Egyptian news story asserting that
Saddam Hussein is increasingly vulnerable to ouster by Iraqi
dissidents. "That gave us a nice little belt," Mr. Pedersen
said.
   While the pickup in volume as prices rose was encouraging,
Mr. Pedersen said: "There's generally no positive news and no
expectation of positive news on the horizon. There's no
reason to buy," which means sellers have a hard time getting
out at desirable prices.
   Oil prices remained relatively stable through the day,
despite news items -- such as Iran echoing Iraq's call for a
holy war -- that might have been expected to send prices
jumping. Mr. Pedersen said he believes the stock market is
priced assuming $30-a-barrel oil. Now investors are shifting
their focus to what emerges from budget deficit-cutting talks
in Washington -- especially regarding higher taxes.
   The Iran holy war news did affect the bond market,
however. "Were Iran suddenly to become a military ally of
Iraq, the Gulf forces there would need someone guarding their
back," said Ward McCarthy, of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates in Princeton, N.J. Partially offsetting that
influence were "faint notes of optimism" for a
deficit-reduction pact to be reached soon, Mr. McCarthy said.
   John Mendelson, a money manager at L.P. Cook &amp; Co., said,
"The feeling among investors is that another rabbit is about
to be pulled out of the hat in Washington," and the Federal
Reserve will respond by easing interest rates.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. Volume was 129.9 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 778 to 638.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000
of face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond rose to 8.94%.
