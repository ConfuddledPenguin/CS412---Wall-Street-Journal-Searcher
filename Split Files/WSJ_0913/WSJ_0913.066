   Butte Mining PLC of Britain has made a takeover offer for
two Australian gold mining concerns, Vam Ltd. and
Perseverance Corp., that values both companies at a total of
about 46.8 million Australian dollars (US$38.2 million).
   Butte is offering two new Butte common 10-pence shares for
every three shares of Vam and four new Butte common 10-pence
shares for each Perseverance share outstanding. At exchange
rates last Thursday, the offer values each Vam common share
at 23.1 cents, which values the whole company at A$26.5
million. It values Perseverance shares at A$1.39 each and the
company at A$20.3 million.

   Vam owns about 49% of Perseverance. An associate of Butte
has agreed to accept Butte's offer for its 16.5% of Vam,
entitling Butte to that stake. Butte doesn't have any
entitlement to Perseverance shares.
   Vam and Perseverance had combined gold production of about
35,000 ounces in the fiscal year ended June 30. They are
forecast to reach an aggregate annualized level of 65,000
ounces by mid-1991.
