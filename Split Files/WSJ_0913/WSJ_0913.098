   BROOKLYN, N.Y. -- A federal judge and a New York state
judge called off plans for an unusual, joint federal-state
trial against former asbestos makers because settlement talks
have successfully resolved most of the cases.
   Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn and state
Justice Helen Freedman of Manhattan had scheduled the trial
to begin Tuesday if efforts to settle the approximately 500
cases failed. In an order, the judges said that almost all of
the cases have been settled or are in the process of being
settled and that a joint trial won't be necessary.

   The personal-injury cases involve former Brooklyn Navy
Yard workers who were exposed to asbestos on the job.
Asbestos, once widely used in insulation, causes cancer and
respiratory ailments years after exposure. More than 40
former asbestos makers and distributors were named as
defendants.
   The two judges teamed up earlier this year to consolidate
the cases and push for a settlement in a federal-state
effort. The hearings rotated from state to federal court,
with both judges presiding at most of the proceedings.
   In their order, the judges praised Kenneth Feinberg, the
court-appointed special master who oversaw the settlement
efforts.
   The settlement amounts haven't been disclosed. The cases
that aren't settled are scheduled to go to trial in separate
state and federal proceedings beginning next week.
