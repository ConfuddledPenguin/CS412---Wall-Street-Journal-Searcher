   In your Aug. 16 Asides "Markets Defended" you described my
opposition to the proposed stock transaction excise tax
(STET). This matter is no aside to those of us who are
concerned about the economic vitality of our cities and
states -- and that of our country. Research conducted by my
office calculated in real terms the multiple blows that STET
will deliver.
   Based on a Congressional Research Service estimate that a
0.5% STET will prompt a 9.3% drop in stock values, the report
by my office notes this could mean the loss of $325 billion
in the value of American equities. This drop will most
certainly have a negative effect on consumer spending and
pose the threat of recession.

   Jobs will also fall victim to STET. An 8% drop in trading
volume will result in a loss of more than 30,000 jobs
nationally in the "FIRE" sector-finance, insurance and real
estate. In New York City we project a loss of 10,000 jobs in
the FIRE sector and 18,000 in non-FIRE private employment.
The aggregate annual income loss in New York alone would be
$1 billion.
   Equally as serious will be the effect on major pension
funds. For example, the pension funds of New York City,
currently valued at $38 billion, will lose $51 million in
direct payments of STET. The expected decline in stock-market
values will hit the pension funds with an additional $1.2
billion to $1.9 billion nationwide; STET will force private
and public pension-fund sponsors to increase their
contributions or decrease benefits to retirees.
   Since state and local government bonds and notes are not
exempt from STET, although federal government securities are,
underwriters estimate that STET will cost New York City $75
million to $125 million a year in additional interest charges
for bond financing and $25 million a year for note sales.
(Similar costs and consequences will be encountered by other
states and localities that issue bonds or notes.) Capital
expenditures for bridges, highways, schools and prison
facilities will be jeopardized. At the same time, New York
City will find its tax base suffering from the job losses and
a consequent reduction in personal-income-tax receipts that
will cost the city $20 million.
   STET proponent Lawrence Summers of Harvard, who believes a
decrease in volume will cut down on volatility, cheers the
idea that the excise tax will "throw sand in the gears" of a
market that works too well. The risk of sending investors to
markets overseas or of forcing the economy into a downgrade
tailspin cannot be left to academic speculation or
Bush-administration hijinks. STET is really another covert
action that attempts to shift the burden of the federal
deficit to already-distressed state and local governments. If
adopted, STET will throw more than sand in their gears; it
will rub salt into already-wounded municipal local and state
economies.
