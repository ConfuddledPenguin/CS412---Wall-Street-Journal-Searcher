   COLUMBUS, Ohio -- National City Corp. said two of its
units were selected by the U.S. Agriculture Department for a
pilot program offering electronic delivery of food-stamp
benefits.
   The bank holding company said the project is expected to
give it an edge in what it called a potentially large
long-term revenue source. A National City spokeswoman
declined to make any projections of earnings from the
project.

   National City said the units involved are National
Processing Co. and First National Bank of Dayton.
   Under the program, recipients of food stamps -- which the
federal government provides to low-income individuals who
meet its guidelines -- will receive a plastic card similar to
a bank automated teller machine card. A microprocessor chip
embedded in the card will provide access to the person's
records and enable the amount of food stamps withdrawn to be
deducted from the amount the recipient is entitled to,
without requiring a call to a central computer.
