   NEW YORK -- Corna &amp; Co., a Columbus, Ohio, securities
firm, agreed to be expelled from the National Association of
Securities Dealers, and its owner was barred from the
industry as regulators charged them with 20 violations of
securities laws and rules, including stock parking.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the firm and
David A. Corna consented to the sanctions imposed by the
securities industry's self-regulatory agency. The NASD also
fined the firm $100,000 and Mr. Corna, of Dublin, Ohio,
$150,000. Corna &amp; Co. was the subject of eight prior
disciplinary actions, the NASD said.

   Mr. Corna was unavailable for comment.
   The main charge in the NASD's disciplinary complaint is
that Corna &amp; Co. executed a stock-parking scheme to conceal a
lack of sufficient capital to conduct a securities business.
Parking securities involves placing them with another entity
to conceal their true ownership and reclaiming them later.
   In Corna &amp; Co.'s case, the NASD said that in February and
March 1988, the firm sold short the stock of First World
Cheese Inc., a Maplewood, N.J., cheese marketer.
   Short sales are effectively bets that a stock's price will
decline. However, First World's stock jumped in price. The
NASD charged that Corna suffered more than $200,000 of losses
on the short sales, and as a result was at least $100,000
below net capital requirements for seven months.
   The NASD charged that instead of ceasing business, as
federal law requires, Corna &amp; Co. placed its short positions
with 19 different customer accounts, hiding its net-capital
deficiency.
   The agency also charged Mr. Corna with creating two
fictitious customer accounts, which allegedly defrauded the
firm through which Corna &amp; Co. cleared its business. And the
agency charged Mr. Corna with forging the signatures of
several customers and former employees on various documents.
   First World Cheese wasn't charged with any wrongdoing.
