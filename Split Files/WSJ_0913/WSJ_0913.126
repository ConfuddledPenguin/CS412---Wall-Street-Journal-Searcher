   The House voted overwhelmingly to require heftier military
spending by U.S. allies in Europe and the Pacific as part of
any post-Cold War defense arrangements.
   The provisions, approved during debate on a $283 billion
defense-authorization bill for fiscal 1991, include a
requirement that Japan pay the full cost of U.S. forces in
that nation.

   The actions are the clearest signal yet that lawmakers are
determined to make long-term, fundamental changes in how the
Pentagon bases and pays for U.S. forces overseas. The
short-term effect, however, depends on whether the Senate
goes along with the House approach. The White House and
Pentagon oppose the House language.
   Meanwhile, lawmakers in the next few days are expected to
receive details about a proposal to sell to Saudi Arabia an
arms package substantially larger than the Pentagon or Saudi
officials previously indicated. Some defense industry
officials estimated that the proposed sales could total as
much as $20 billion -- about twice as large as the packages
disclosed previously -- if the White House doesn't pare the
Saudi request for political reasons.
   In yesterday's action on the defense bill, the House voted
370-to-53 to adopt an amendment requiring Tokyo to pay the
entire $5 billion estimated annual cost of keeping 50,000
U.S. troops and their dependents in Japan. If Japanese
officials balk, the amendment requires the U.S. to reduce its
forces in that country by 5,000 soldiers each year.
   Reflecting the frustration of many lawmakers, Rep. David
Bonior (D., Mich.) said: "History has shown that we need to
be tough to get action from Japan."
   For the first time since World War II, the House also
voted to require the Pentagon to draft plans for so-called
dual basing of troops in Japan, West Germany and other
nations. Under this concept, most of the Army and Air Force
units stationed overseas, as well as their dependents, would
be brought back to U.S. bases. Small contingents of troops
would return without their dependents periodically for
training and military exercises during six-month tours, but
the cost of keeping them overseas would be far less than
under the current system.
   The Senate version of the bill doesn't contain such
provisions, and senior members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee have favored a more gradual approach to burden
sharing.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.), the main sponsor of
the dual-basing provision, said the U.S. currently is paying
to keep more than 300,000 troops to protect West Germany from
East German forces, while "all of the East Germans are
shopping in West Germany at the malls . . . . It doesn't make
any sense."
   In another section of the authorization bill, the House
agreed to set up a bipartisan commission, similar to one
created under the Reagan administration, to recommend which
domestic bases should be closed as overall Pentagon spending
declines. But the language effectively prohibits closing any
bases for two years. Critics contend that would tie the hands
of Pentagon officials and permit parochial interests to fight
for jobs by keeping unnecessary bases in operation.
   When the House resumes debate today on the bill, one of
its most controversial provisions isn't expected to come to a
vote. Proponents of the B-2 Stealth bomber, which the bill
proposes to kill, have decided they don't want to risk a
lopsided defeat on the House floor. Instead, they will rely
on supporters in the Senate to try to keep the radar-eluding
plane alive in a conference committee.
   The B-2 will survive the conference "if we have a good
strong commitment from the administration" for the program,
predicted Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.) "But it's sometimes
hard to know what that commitment is."
   The White House has threatened to veto the defense bill if
it kills the B-2, sharply restricts funding for Star Wars
antimissile research and cuts too deeply into uniformed
personnel.
   Efforts to fashion a defense bill have been complicated by
uncertainties over the outcome of the current budget talks
between Congress and the White House. In addition, lawmakers
haven't decided how to factor in the expected
multibillion-dollar cost of military operations in the Middle
East.
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D.,
Wis.), for example, has been pushing to include the funds as
part of a later supplemental appropriations measure. Other
House leaders want to earmark at least $7 billion for the
operation as part of the 1991 bill.
   For the Saudi arms deal, U.S. defense industry officials
said the Bush administration is planning to request expedited
congressional approval to sell the Saudis about 24 F-15
fighters and 48 Apache tank-destructing helicopters, both
made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. The package, according to
these officials, also is slated to include Bradley Fighting
Vehicles, built by FMC Corp.; Patriot air-defense missiles
built by Raytheon Co.; as well as trucks and other support
equipment.
