   RIO DE JANEIRO -- A few weeks ago, a top American
executive from a major multinational corporation was all set
to come here on business and to visit a relative at the same
time. But he ran into a problem: His employer wouldn't let
him make the trip.
   "We wouldn't send anyone down there unless absolutely
necessary," explains a spokesman for the company, who asked
that the identities of the company and the executive not be
disclosed for "obvious security reasons." Going to Rio these
days, he adds, "would be the same as going to the {Persian}
Gulf."

   Although few companies hold such extreme views or take
such extreme precautions, Rio is, in fact, a dangerous city.
Kidnapping has replaced the lambada as the latest Brazilian
craze. The targets are usually prosperous businessmen, and
have included one foreigner, a West German executive who
police found five days after his abduction.
   In Rio, alone, there have been 31 kidnappings this year --
more than double the figure for all of Brazil last year --
and total ransom payments exceeding $10 million. This week,
breaking a 69-day lull, kidnappers struck again, nabbing two
students, Vania Benzaquem and Alexandre Wenkert, as they
drove to college. Both are children of wealthy businessmen,
and one of the executives commented that kidnapping "is one
of the few growth industries in Brazil."
   But the kidnapping wave is no joke. Long used to living
with high levels of violence, Brazilian society has suddenly
grown afraid that the kidnappings are a disturbing sign that
organized crime is taking hold of urban areas. "Criminal
groups are organizing more and more and getting increasingly
involved in politics," says Alba Zaluar, a sociologist
specializing in crime. "{The kidnappers} may be trying to
interfere in the {October gubernatorial and congressional}
elections, get money to buy votes to support politicians {who
are} less inclined to repress."
   Police and state government officials disagree. Jorge
Mario Gomes, the director of the police's anti-kidnapping
division, sees a simple reason for the sudden surge in
kidnappings: the need for money. Many of the kidnappers, he
says, are people who used to rob banks. But since Brazil
enforced a tough anti-inflation plan in March, freezing much
of the money in circulation, banks have less cash. Moreover,
many of the kidnappers had their illicit cash gains frozen,
too.
   So kidnapping has become "the fashionable crime," Mr.
Gomes asserts.
   The ruckus triggered by the surge of kidnappings is
starting to focus attention on Brazil's crime problem.
   So pervasive is Rio's crime that some joke that the city's
symbol, the huge statue of Christ that dominates the city
from a hilltop, should have its hands up instead of
outstretched. In 1989, according to police figures, there
were 7,654 homicides, 1,201 rapes, 14,436 car robberies,
65,027 robberies, 3,104 break-ins and 420 bank robberies in
the state of Rio. The population tops three million.
   Now, a new fighting spirit is emerging."Kidnappings are
the drop of water that made the glass spill over," says Nello
Pedra Gandara, the owner of the Four Paws Kennel in Sao
Paolo, a dog-training establishment that's doing a huge
business offering $1,200-a-month anti-kidnapping courses with
the use of dogs. Many other security outfits are cashing in
on fear, offering to install James Bond-like gadgets on cars
or to teach drivers defensive measures.
   While many say this uproar illustrates the injustice of
Brazilian society -- violence only becomes an issue when it
moves out of the slums and affects members of the elite --
security is emerging as a leading theme in the October
elections. Some 57% of respondents to a recent survey in the
daily Folha de Sao Paulo identified crime as the leading
problem in Rio today, far ahead of cost of living, the usual
bogeyman, which drew only 17%.
   Sitting under a three-dimensional picture of Jesus Christ
whose eyes open and close depending on the angle from which
it's looked at, an exhausted-looking Mr. Gomes, the
anti-kidnap chief, says: "I sleep only three hours a night.
My family sees me only on television."
   Mr. Gomes has results to show for his long hours of work,
however. "We're arresting people daily," he says. More than
70 people have been arrested in the past few weeks and the
police claim to have identified and begun to dismantle nine
different but interlinked kidnapping groups.
   Some cases have been bizarre.
   In one case in Sao Paulo in July, the family of
businessman Gilberto Bernardini paid a much higher ransom
than the kidnappers had requested. When they called for the
first time, they requested five million cruzeiros, or about
$60,000. Mr. Bernardini's son, also named Gilberto,
misunderstood. He thought they asked for $5 million and
started negotiating on that basis. He ended up shelling out
$1.8 million.
   In Rio, businessman Sergio de Paulo Pacheco was kidnapped
and released the following day after payment of a ransom of
$200,000 plus 10 million cruzeiros, another $125,000. Mr.
Pacheco never reported the case to the police. A few weeks
later, however, he complained that those who had kidnapped
him were now threatening to kidnap him again unless he paid
yet another 25 million cruzeiros. The police laid a trap and
arrested four kidnappers. Among them was a soldier in the
Military Police.
   Roberto Medina, a prominent advertising executive and rock
promoter, has helped arouse Brazilian outrage over the
kidnappings. His case brought home to many the growing
audacity of kidnappers.
   Mr. Medina was kidnapped in early June as he left the
offices of Artplan, his advertising company. He was taken to
a cold, humid house where he spent two weeks sleeping on the
floor, his eyes covered with glasses whose lenses were
blacked out by tape. After his family paid a $2.5 million
ransom, Mr. Medina was set free on a Rio street after being
inexplicably presented by one of his kidnappers with a
sparrow in a cage. "I told them I didn't want the sparrow,"
the 41-year-old Mr. Medina recalls. "They told me if I didn't
take it, I wouldn't be set free."
   Although clearly shaken by the experience, Mr. Medina
thinks his kidnapping has contributed to snapping people out
of their complacency toward crime.
   Mr. Medina has talked with Brazil's President Fernando
Collor de Mello to suggest ways to improve security. He is
also doing his bit to try to improve Rio's image.
   Sitting in his office that overlooks the city, he says Rio
is "the most beautiful place in the world. It has a magic, a
musicality," and needs only a spark to renew its past as
cultural and tourism capital of Brazil.
   Mr. Medina is hoping to light that spark and contribute to
its musicality by organizing an eight-day rock festival here
in January. "I want to show the good side of Rio, show that
it's not only violence," he says, adding:"Rio will recover,
like New York did. And rock in Rio will be the starting
point."
