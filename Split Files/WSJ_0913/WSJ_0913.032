   Santa Fe Pacific Corp., Chicago, said it has accepted for
exchange $215.6 million principal amount of its 16% senior
subordinated debentures, due 2003, under its previously
announced debt-for-equity swap.
   The railroad, real estate and natural resources concern
said debenture holders will receive 67.25 shares of its stock
plus $26.67 for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures
accepted for exchange. Santa Fe said it will issue 14.5
million common shares in the exchange offer.

   Santa Fe said the debentures are being purchased on a pro
rata basis; the definitive pro rata factor is expected to be
announced on or about next Tuesday.
   The company said it is continuing with its plan to
refinance and redeem the remaining $565 million of debentures
outstanding on about Oct. 31 through the issuance of
long-term debt at the parent company and proceeds of an
offering of variable-rate exchangeable debentures at its
pipeline subsidiary.
