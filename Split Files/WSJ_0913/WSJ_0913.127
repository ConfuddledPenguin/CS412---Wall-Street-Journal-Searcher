   Honda Motor Co., Gardena, Calif., said it is raising base
prices on several 1991 models as much as 7.2%, although it is
freezing prices on some versions.
   The biggest price increase is on the Prelude 2.0 Si. The
1991 model will have a base price of $14,945, up 7.2% from a
year earlier. Honda said spokesmen weren't immediately
available to comment on the reason for the move.

   The Japanese auto maker is boosting the price on its most
expensive Prelude, the Si four-speed equipped with automatic
transmission, 4.9% to $19,450. Honda said it will also raise
the base price on its 1991 Civic three-door hatchback to
$6,895, up 3.9% from a year earlier.
   The auto maker isn't changing prices on some other 1991
models, including the CRX HF and the CRX Si.
   Honda said that, on average, its 1991-model base reflect
an increase of 1%, or $140 a car. That average includes a
modest increase on the Accord, the top-selling car model in
the U.S. Its base price, announced earlier, will increase
$200, or 1.6%, from the 1990 model.
