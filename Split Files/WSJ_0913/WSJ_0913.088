   Ratners Group PLC, the British retailer in the midst of a
takeover bid for Kay Jewelers Inc. of Alexandria, Va.,
reported a 37% plunge in pretax profit for the first six
months of the year.
   Britain's biggest jewelery chain said pretax profit fell
to #9.30 million ($17.3 million) from #14.7 million a year
earlier.

   The latest results, in line with market expectations,
suffer in the comparison because of a #7.4 million gain on
investments and property disposals in the 1989 period. There
were no such gains in the latest period.
   Ratner said that despite the slowdown in U.K. consumer
demand, the company is heading toward "the all-important
Christmas season with confidence."
   The $328 million bid for Kay, funded in large part through
a 1-for-4 rights issue, is expected to be completed before
the Christmas selling period, it said.
