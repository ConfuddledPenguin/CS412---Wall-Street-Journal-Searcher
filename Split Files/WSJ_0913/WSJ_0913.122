   Staodyn Inc. said it expects to post a loss of $275,000 to
$300,000 for the second quarter, ended Sept. 1, compared with
profit of $100,147, or six cents a share, a year earlier.
   Based in Longmont, Colo., the company, which recently
changed its name from Staodynamics, also said sales would be
down 18%. The sales decline, "plus our own mistakes," caused
the loss, according to Bayne Gibson, chief executive officer.
"We have initiated the necessary steps to turn the sales
picture around, but it may take the rest of the year," he
said.

   The company said product-development costs for a new power
wheelchair added to the loss. Staodyn makes medical
electronics used to relieve chronic and acute pain and for
muscle rehabilitation.
