   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Has one of the nation's most
prestigious universities been cheating Uncle Sam out of
millions of dollars in research money?
   Stanford University disclosed it was investigating that
and other concerns in the wake of charges by a federal
official that the school may have submitted "false" and
"fraudulent" claims for various overhead charges related to
research projects bankrolled at the university by the federal
government.

   Stanford said the Office of the Chief of Naval Research
was reviewing whether the government made a "significant
overpayment" to the university for overhead costs. That
inquiry, Stanford said, apparently stemmed from a March 6
report by a campus-based representative of the agency who
alleged that Stanford officials may have engaged in
"fraudulent acts" and made "false claims" in its billing
practices, including "excessive library cost reimbursement"
amounting to $30 million to $40 million from 1983 to 1986.
   The full amount of any overbilling or wrongdoing wasn't
given in the report, which Stanford itself released. The
campus representative, Paul Biddle, declined comment,
referring calls to Pentagon officials, who couldn't be
reached.
   An arm of the Pentagon, the naval research office is the
federal agency with which Stanford negotiates overhead rates
that it charges for all federal research projects. Stanford
received some $400 million in research money in the 1988-89
academic year, the latest figures available, and, like most
major research institutions, most of that came from the
federal government. It is considered among the top two or
three recipients of federal research money among U.S.
universities. About $91 million of that figure reflected
overhead costs, which are charges for such things as use of
facilities, maintenance and utility expenses.
   Stanford officials said its internal audit of the
situation is due to be completed by Sept. 28. In a statement,
Stanford president Donald Kennedy said the fact that the
overhead issue was being scrutinized wasn't unusual. He said
the Stanford officials responsible for calculating overhead
"enjoy excellent reputations in their professions and
widespread confidence here at Stanford," and said the
university was eager to cooperate with the inquiry.
   Overhead charges, also known as indirect costs, have been
the subject of much debate in academic circles, amid federal
budget austerity and declining support for university
research in general. Many university administrators claim
that major funding sources such as the government have failed
to pay their fair share of such costs in recent times. Some
grant recipients, meanwhile, have complained that bloated
university bureaucracies and ambitious campus building
programs have taken a bite out of outside funds that would
otherwise have been directly available for their research.
   Last month, U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) asked the
General Accounting Office to review federal contracting
procedures with an eye towards examining escalating overhead
rates at major universities, including Stanford.
