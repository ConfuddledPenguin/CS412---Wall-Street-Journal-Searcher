   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian President Fernando Collor de
Mello, continuing his drive to liberalize the country's
economy, unveiled plans to speed up the opening of the
computer and electronics industry to foreign competition.
   In an announcement that will be welcomed by Brazil's major
trading partners, the government said it will end its
controversial "market reserve" for electronics by Oct. 29,
1992, two years ahead of schedule. The market reserve
effectively prevented the import of foreign computers,
software and electronics to Brazil.

   At the same time, the government said the list of
protected items is to be reduced to 30 immediately. Those
items, to be specified later, will include microcomputers and
minicomputers and software that cost no more than three times
the price of foreign-made equivalents.
   All other products can now be imported immediately,
provided import duties are paid, or produced locally by
multinational companies. Protection also will be lifted for
computers, electronics and telecommunications equipment that
is more than four years old.
   In a bid to allow Brazil to overcome its technological
lag, the government also said it will submit a bill to
Congress that would reduce obligatory local content in
electronics to 30% from 70% now. The government also said it
would allow foreign companies to hold 49% of joint ventures,
compared with a maximum 30% now.
   The moves are part of Mr. Collor's efforts to boost the
competitiveness of Brazil's economy and end its longstanding
protectionist trade policies, which he feels have caused
Brazil to fall behind in terms of technology and quality. "It
will be a great challenge to the nation's industry to face
foreign competition," Jose Goldemberg, Brazil's science and
technology secretary, said.
   The market reserve was created by the military governments
that ruled from 1964 to 1985. Big multinational companies,
such as International Business Machines Corp., were limited
to the production of large computers.
