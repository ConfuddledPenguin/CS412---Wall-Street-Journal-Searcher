   LOS ANGELES -- A federal bankruptcy judge approved the
sale of $42.4 million in assets by Qintex Entertainment Inc.,
which filed for bankruptcy protection last October, to RHI
Entertainment Inc.
   When Qintex also completes the sale of about $20 million
in interests in HR Broadcasting Inc., an owner of television
stations, it will have completed the transition to a shell
company with about $100 million in tax benefits. Los
Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp., bondholders and other
creditors are awaiting a reorganization plan, but Qintex had
wanted to make the sale before the value of the assets
declined, said company president Jonathan D. Lloyd.

   The assets acquired by RHI Entertainment, a closely held
New York television production concern bankrolled by New Line
Cinema Corp. and Chemical Bank, includes the Qintex film and
television library, which contains among other properties the
miniseries "Lonesome Dove" and the Laurel and Hardy films.
They also include about $25 million in accounts receivable
and $10 million in cash.
   Qintex Entertainment is 43% owned by Qintex Australia, a
unit Brisbane-based Qintex Ltd., which made a $1.5 billion
bid to acquire MGM/UA Communications Co. last year. The deal
collapsed. The assets sale is still subject to more court
approvals but Qintex said it expected the transaction to be
completed next month.
