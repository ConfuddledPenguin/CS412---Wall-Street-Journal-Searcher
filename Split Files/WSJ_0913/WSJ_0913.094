   General Motors Corp. said its engine division will provide
jobs to about 135 laid-off hourly workers at a new engine
remanufacturing business to be located in Lansing, Mich.
   The venture, while small, has symbolic importance as
contract talks between GM and the United Auto Workers union
head toward a strike deadline tomorrow night. The UAW is
demanding that GM step up efforts to re-employ idled workers
by launching ventures such as this.

   The engine remanufacturing business is the first venture
to be funded by a $100 million fund established under the
1987 UAW-GM national contract. The fund is designed to
provide new jobs that aren't included in the scope of GM's
operations, the auto maker said. GM officials wouldn't
disclose the cost of the business.
   The remanufactured engines will be sold through the GM
service parts operations, a GM spokesman said.
