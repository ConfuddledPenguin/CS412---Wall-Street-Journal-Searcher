   The prospect of record yields forced the Agriculture
Department to boost its production estimates for the 1990
corn and wheat crops.
   The new estimates are expected to trigger a major selling
spree this morning in the commodity markets, driving down
grain prices anywhere from three cents to five cents a
bushel.

   The department, in its most definitive 1990 crop forecast
yet, said it expects U.S. farmers to harvest 8.12 billion
bushels of corn, up 3% from last month's estimate and up 8%
from last year's actual production. Corn yields are projected
to average a record 121.7 bushels an acre, four bushels more
than forecast last month.
   At the same time, the department boosted its forecast of
wheat production by 2% to 2.76 billion bushels in light of a
record spring wheat crop of 581 million bushels projected for
this fall. A bumper winter wheat crop already is in the bins.
As a result, department analysts expect average yields for
all wheat to equal the record 39.4 bushels an acre, set in
1983.
   Soybean production was forecast at 1.83 billion bushels,
essentially unchanged from last month's estimate. Some market
analysts had expected a drop in the estimate, but drought
damage to the soybean crop in the Mississippi Delta during
August was offset by good growing conditions in the Midwest.
   In Chicago, analysts said corn futures prices would be
down about five cents a bushel at the start of trading today.
Over the next few days, they said, the corn prices could
plunge as much as 20 cents a bushel.
   The department's new corn forecast was unexpected. Most
analysts had estimated a harvest of 7,968,000,000 bushels;
the highest estimate called for 8,108,000,000.
   "These figures are amazing, especially when you plant as
late as we did this year," said Daniel Basse, director of
market research for AgResource Co., Chicago.
   The new yield estimate of 121.7 bushels of corn an acre
surpasses the previous high of 119.8 bushels an acre reached
in 1987. Very favorable weather in July and August helped
counteract a soggy June, which kept many farmers from
planting until well after usual corn-planting deadlines.
   Typically, record yields occur in the second year after a
drought, analysts said. Although 1988 was a drought year, no
one had expected the pattern to hold this year, because of
the late planting.
   The department's report on wheat yields and wheat
stockpiles is likely to force down wheat futures prices --
and increase pressure on the Bush administration to do
whatever it can to prop up wheat prices.
   The report predicted that U.S. wheat stockpiles will total
946 million bushels on June 30, 1991, up sharply from 535
million bushels last June 30. The record spring wheat crop
and weakening export prospects prompted department analysts
to raise their stockpile forecast by 100 million bushels from
last month.
   If the administration doesn't extend credit guarantees to
foreign countries for additional wheat purchases, the number
of acres planted this fall with winter wheat will have to be
curtailed to avoid further price-depressing surpluses,
analysts said.
   On Tuesday, the Senate approved a bill introduced by Sen.
Bob Dole (R., Kan.) that would require farmers enrolled in
the government's subsidy program to idle 15% of their 1991
wheat acreage. The bill also would urge Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter to give farmers the option of setting aside
additional acreage in return for government payments. Similar
legislation is pending in the House.
   Mr. Yeutter has said he can't announce an exact set-aside
figure because of discrepancies between House and Senate
versions of the 1990 farm bill, which haven't yet been
reconciled by conferees. Mr. Dole's bill and a bill submitted
by Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) are designed to give farmers
timely guidance on how much wheat to plant this fall.
   But there's nothing lawmakers can do to avert the sell-off
foreseen for the markets today. Even soybeans will be
affected, analysts said. While soybean futures prices are
expected to remain strong over the long term, they are
expected to plunge today in sympathy with corn and wheat.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose, mostly in response to a
strong London market. The soonest-to-expire September
contract advanced 1.10 cents a pound to $1.3590, while the
most-active December was up 0.20 cent to $1.2875. The premium
of September over December widened by 0.90 cent to 7.15 cents
a pound. In London, the premium of the cash position on the
London Metal Exchange over the three-months delivery doubled
to about 10 cents a pound; the cash position was quoted at
$3,365 a metric ton, and the three-months delivery was at
$2,943 a ton. Analysts expressed surprise and puzzlement at
the strength in London, which they said wasn't justified by
market fundamentals. However, William O'Neill, senior futures
strategist for Merrill Lynch, noted that "the European copper
market is stronger than the one in the U.S. Japan has been a
continuous buyer in London. European demand for copper
remains at a comparatively high level, particularly from West
Germany, and it isn't significantly reflecting any evidence
of an economic slowdown." European metal dealers kept their
supplies low and have been buying copper only as needed while
waiting for copper prices to peak out from the current rally,
Mr. O'Neill said. "Now, it appears that the dealers' supplies
may have been smaller than was thought and they're having to
come in to buy copper to fulfill continued industrial demand.
This has helped boost prices," he said.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices closed higher yesterday
after jumping late in what had been a dull trading day at the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Light sweet crude for October
delivery ended at $30.97 a barrel, up 21 cents. Petroleum
product prices finished mixed, as gasoline prices moved
higher along with crude prices futures late in the session.
Heating oil futures ended lower. A report released by the
American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday should have
produced a more bearish response in the marketplace. However,
concern over the Middle East continued to provide some
support for prices. The industry report showed that
distillate stocks had grown by 5.0 million barrels to 131.7
million barrels last week. Crude oil stocks increased 2.1
million barrels to 374.3 million barrels, while gasoline
stocks rose 650,000 barrels to 211.1 million barrels.
However, traders perceived President Bush's speech Tuesday
night as well as Iran's overtures to Iraq as hawkish and
declined to sell heavily in the face of such news.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: The soonest-to-expire October futures contract
rose strongly, while most other months were moderately
higher. October ended with a gain of 1.73 cents a pound at
73.90 cents, after climbing its daily limit of two cents a
pound shortly before the close. Continuous rain in the
southern part of the Mississippi Delta, a major
cotton-growing area, has delayed the crop, according to
Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache
Securities. The rains began sporadically last week, have been
steady this week and are expected to continue into the
weekend, he said. "This means the crop in that area, instead
of being early as had been expected, will be collected at
about the usual time," he explained. "As a consequence, there
will be very little or any to deliver against the October
contract on the exchange." The first day for the issuance of
notices to deliver cotton against the October contract is
Sept. 24. There are 1,194 bales of cotton currently in
warehouses of the New York Cotton Exchange that have been
certificated for delivery against futures contracts, Mr.
Simon noted. In contrast, the number of outstanding October
contracts that remain to be nullified by an opposite trade or
satisfied by delivery of the commodity amount to the
equivalent of 277,500 bales. The number of outstanding
contracts, known as the open interest, "isn't particularly
large as such, but it's huge compared with the amount of
cotton in storage for delivery against" the expiring October
contract, Mr. Simon said. Separately, the analyst said the
Agriculture Department crop report, issued after the close of
trading, was about neutral for cotton. The department
estimated U.S. cotton production for the 1990-91 season,
which began Sept. 1, at 14.7 million bales, only 142,000
bales less than the August estimate. "That wasn't a
significant difference," Mr. Simon said. Output in 1989-90
was 12.2 million bales. The report showed little change for
world cotton production from the August estimate, and it said
that a 200,000-ton increase expected in U.S. mill use of
cotton would be offset by a drop of the same amount in U.S.
exports this season.
