   Aon Corp. made a surprise $40-a-share, or $840 million,
proposal for Corroon &amp; Black Corp., challenging a
$33.49-a-share, or $703 million, stock-swap accord under
which the New York insurance broker has agreed to merge with
Willis Faber PLC of London.
   Aon's unsolicited all-cash proposal offers a premium to
the terms of the tentative deal with Willis Faber, which
received a chilly reaction from the market when it was
announced in June, and on which Corroon holders haven't yet
voted. But some experts said tax and other considerations
make Aon's proposal less than a sure bet to succeed.

   Corroon &amp; Black said it is "studying" the new bid from the
Chicago insurance concern. In composite New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday, Corroon shares soared $6.75, to
close at $37.625. Volume was nearly 1.7 million shares.
   The latest proposal represents one of the first big public
bidding contests in a year marked by a dearth of high-profile
takeover battles. This year's merger slowdown reflects the
collapse of the junk-bond market, tight bank credit
conditions and most recently the economic uncertainty created
by the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The combination of Aon's Rollins Burdick Hunter Group
insurance brokerage unit with Corroon &amp; Black would create
the world's fourth-largest insurance brokerage concern, with
annual revenue of nearly $1 billion, Aon said.
   An insurance broker specializes in assisting primarily
corporate clients in seeking and arranging coverage with an
insurance company.
   "We are not interested in pursuing any transaction which
is opposed by your board of directors," Patrick G. Ryan, Aon
chairman, president and chief executive officer, wrote in a
letter to Corroon &amp; Black's chairman and chief executive,
Richard M. Miller. But, he continued, "we believe that your
board will conclude, as our board and financial advisers . .
. have concluded, that $40 in cash per share from Aon Corp.
represents a superior proposal to the proposed merger" with
Willis Faber.
   Under the proposed merger with the London insurance
broker, Corroon holders would receive for each of their
shares 7.8 shares of Willis, whose shares currently trade on
London's stock exchange. While the swap offered stock worth
$38.13 the morning the accord was offered, Willis shares have
slumped since the disclosure, and Corroon shares have
similarly declined. In London trading Wednesday, Willis
shares closed off one pence at 231 pence, or $4.29, a share.
Willis officials weren't available for comment.
   Mr. Ryan stressed in the letter to his counterpart that
Aon's proposal "is firm and not subject to fluctuation" and
"eliminates all of the concerns which your stock holders may
have about currency exchange rates, stock market
fluctuations, the trading and liquidity of American
depositary receipts, and the tax treatment of foreign source
dividends."
   The Aon offer for Corroon &amp; Black is "a complete
surprise," especially because Corroon was just weeks away
from completing its merger with Willis Faber, said Russell
Miller, a San Francisco investment banker. He added that Aon
hadn't given any indication that it wanted to expand its
insurance brokerage business to the size that it would if it
swallowed Corroon &amp; Black. Currently, Corroon is the fifth
largest insurance broker in the U.S. and Rollins Burdick
ranks seventh.
   While the Willis Faber offer for Corroon got a cool
reception in the U.S. market, analysts had viewed the merger
as a good strategic move for both companies. Corroon had been
looking to expand internationally to better serve its large
corporate clients. The merger would give Willis Faber a
significant presence in the vast U.S. insurance market.
   "Aon may have the money, but it doesn't have the European
or Asian connections that Willis Faber has," Mr. Miller, the
investment banker, said.
   Aon shares slipped $1.50 in Big Board trading yesterday,
closing at $33.
   Its cash bid for Corroon represents a higher
price-to-earnings ratio than other recent acquisitions in the
insurance brokerage industry. But Mr. Miller figures that on
an after-tax basis, the Aon offer doesn't give Corroon
shareholders a much greater profit than if they stuck with
the Willis Faber proposal. Cash deals require selling
shareholders to pay capital-gains taxes, while stock-swap
transactions are typically done on a tax-free basis.
   Such a tax consideration could be an important one, as
about 30% of Corroon's stock is held by management and
company employees. These employees include many former
brokerage agency owners who sold their firms to Corroon in
exchange for stock.
   To make the deal more appealing, Mr. Miller expects Aon
would probably have to offer more cash. Yet, he believes
Willis Faber may sweeten its offer for Corroon.
   Not all analysts are betting on a higher bid for Corroon,
however. Ira Malis, an insurance industry analyst at Alex.
Brown &amp; Sons, advised clients that with Corroon shares
selling near $38, "I'd be more of a seller than a buyer. I
don't have a lot of confidence in a higher deal coming
along."
   Corroon's shares retreated from a high yesterday of
$38.125, as traders became concerned that Willis Faber might
not try to top the Aon bid and that Corroon and the London
concern might try to go through with their merger on the
original terms. While Corroon and Faber holders must still
approve the merger in votes scheduled for Sept. 28, some
traders worried that Aon could drop its bid if Corroon
directors rebuffed it.
   Some analysts noted that the economic environment for a
merger between two U.S. brokers is hardly upbeat right now.
Property/casualty insurers have been locked in a three-year
pricing war and brokers have watched their profit margins
slip as their commissions and fees, which are based on
premiums, declined.
   Aon's largest unit is its Combined Insurance Co., the
company founded by Aon's former head, W. Clement Stone. Mr.
Stone stepped down as the holding company's chairman earlier
this year at age 87, and Mr. Ryan added that title.
