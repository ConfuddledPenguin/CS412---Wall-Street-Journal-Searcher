   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Jonathan D. Krane wowed Wall
Street three years ago when he announced the creation of a
1930s-style Hollywood studio with a 1980s twist.
   The charismatic attorney said he would make quality
low-budget movies driven by the "passion" of directors,
writers and actors whose careers the company also managed,
including John Travolta and Mr. Krane's wife, Sally
Kellerman.

   Management Company Entertainment Group Inc. raised more
than $120 million and became a hot stock last year after
producing the box-office hit "Look Who's Talking," starring
Mr. Travolta. Flattering articles about the MCEG and its
chief appeared in magazines and newspapers.
   But Mr. Krane, 38 years old, has recently inspired more
enmity than passion in Hollywood. The company is in default
on more than $100 million of debt to major creditors,
including the GE Capital unit of General Electric Co., and it
owes money to scores in Hollywood.
   Director Nicolas Roeg and two other creditors have taken
legal steps to force MCEG's movie unit into liquidation, and
today is the deadline for the company's response. MCEG, which
is frantically trying to recruit investors, has told Mr.
Roeg's attorney that it plans to ask for more time in a
federal bankruptcy court hearing today.
   More than 100 employees have been fired, leaving a staff
of fewer than 25 at headquarters here. Many of the departed
have harsh words for Mr. Krane. "Look up the word
`megalomaniac' in the dictionary and his picture is there,"
says Alan Lasoff, a former MCEG talent manager. "Jonathan is
mean, nasty and hateful," adds Andrew Milner, a former MCEG
senior vice president.
   At a time when major studios are making movies with big
stars and budgets over $50 million, Mr. Krane tried to make
movies for $5 million and under, using lesser-knowns. With
such low budgets, he said, all his movies would be profitable
through the sale of distribution rights overseas and to home
video.
   But Mr. Krane has turned out to be more skilled at issuing
positive press releases than in running a studio. He
announced many more movies than he made, and most of those he
released were disappointments in the U.S. and elsewhere.
"Look Who's Talking," the one box-office hit, was produced by
MCEG for Tri-Star Pictures Inc. What Mr. Krane didn't reveal
in press interviews was that while the movie has taken in
$283 million, MCEG's share has been less than $2 million.
   Mr. Krane did succeed in keeping film costs low, but in
the process a lot of directors, producers and vendors simply
weren't paid; many have filed lawsuits. Meanwhile, Mr. Krane
created huge overhead through rapid expansion into
distribution and even film financing.
   Despite the unpaid bills, Mr. Krane spent like a mogul. He
flew MGM Grand Air, the luxury airline, so many times that
his secretary received a free ticket. He drives a black
Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible, at a leasing cost to the
company of $30,689 last year.
   And, like a mogul, he made the films he wanted to make.
Hollywood executives joked that it was "The Sally Kellerman
Company" after Mr. Krane cast his wife, who is 53, as a femme
fatale in "Boris and Natasha," a $3.6 million movie, so far
unreleased.
   "It was a charismatic organization that was able to borrow
money. But they were morons with checkbooks," says Rick
Endelson, a former production controller of the company's
movie unit.
   Mr. Krane agreed to an initial interview for this article
and said he would be available for additional interviews.
However, he didn't return subsequent phone calls. Henley
Saltzburg, a lawyer for Mr. Krane, responded to a written
list of questions with this statement: "Since the information
and the allegations were unfounded and since the information
seemed to be obtained from disgruntled and former employees,
the questions will not be presented to Mr. Krane."
   A Michigan shareholder sued MCEG in state court here
charging that it misrepresented its financial condition to
inflate its stock price and give "the illusion of success."
The company denied the allegations, and the suit is pending.
The stock, which first traded at 62 1/2 cents and rose as
high as $4.375 last year, closed yesterday at 3 1/8 cents a
share (up 1/32 point) in over-the-counter trading.
   Mr. Krane blames the company's current state on his
co-founder, William J. Rouhana, 38, whom he fired four months
ago as vice chairman. "He was in charge of finance and
distribution. I basically relied on him," says Mr. Krane.
Says Mr. Rouhana: "As chairman and chief executive officer,
he was in charge."
   The roots of the company go back a decade to group therapy
sessions in Beverly Hills. Mr. Krane, the son of a Los
Angeles auto-leasing executive, had attended Yale law school
and later worked as a tax and film-finance attorney. His
entree into Hollywood came when he entered therapy and met
Ms. Kellerman and director Blake Edwards in the same group.
   He married Ms. Kellerman, who played Hot Lips Houlihan in
the 1970 movie "MASH," and co-founded an entertainment
company with Mr. Edwards in 1981. Mr. Edwards hoped Mr. Krane
could take that company public, say former associates.
   However, they say the two had an acrimonious parting after
Mr. Edwards discovered Mr. Krane instead had been working to
take his own company, MCEG, public. Mr. Edwards declines to
comment.
   Mr. Krane says the parting was amicable, adding, "I will
forever be indebted to him."
   After raising $9.2 million in a public offering in August
1987, MCEG bought Manson International, an international
distribution company, for about $4.9 million, providing a
source of revenue. Press releases flowed. In February 1988,
Mr. Krane announced a $50 million slate of 14 movies for
distribution that year. Just seven months later, he sounded
even more ambitious, announcing a total of 21 pictures valued
at $133 million.
   But MCEG released only one movie in 1988, despite having
put many more into production. It was "The Chocolate War," a
movie about a boys' school, written and directed by
actor-client Keith Gordon with a budget of just $750,000. Mr.
Krane produced three other movies that year, but one was
released only on video and two, produced for another company,
quickly disappeared. He now says the company has produced a
total of 10 films at an average cost of $2.7 million.
   Richard Martini wrote and directed "Limit Up," a $2.4
million movie about a commodity trader who trades her soul
for success. The movie opened and closed quickly last year,
as did "Catch Me If You Can," about a high-school class that
bets on car races.
   "He had an inability to see the product for what it was,"
contends Mr. Lasoff, the former talent manager. "He said we
were making more movies than anyone else, that we were making
`A' product at a fraction of the cost. The reality was we
were making `C' product at best."
   One product was "Boris and Natasha," a movie based on the
old TV cartoon characters. Mr. Krane cast his wife as Natasha
although many felt that Ms. Kellerman was too old for the
part. "I personally feel she was tremendously miscast," says
Joel Soisson, one of the film's producers. Mr. Krane
continued to rework the movie, adding a song by Ms.
Kellerman, but it has yet to be released.
   MCEG paid $7,330 for Ms. Kellerman's personal exercise
trainer, Mr. Soisson says. "There were a lot of costs that
were arguably not germane to the film," he adds. MCEG also
backed Ms. Kellerman's singing career, paying more than
$25,000 for a nightclub act, a voice trainer, musicians and
recording time, adds Mr. Endelson, the former production
controller. Ms. Kellerman declines comment.
   Mr. Krane's public face was that of a strict cost cutter.
He appeared on the set in his Rolls-Royce and asked, "Who's
complaining about {working} overtime? I want to know who it
is and I want them fired," recalls Mr. Soisson. "A lot of the
crew had total contempt for him and the production," he says.
   Some projects were delayed because of cash-flow problems.
While Mr. Krane hoped to cover production costs by selling
foreign rights, that market went sour.
   Mr. Milner, the senior vice president, was in London in
October 1988 on his way to a sales convention when a fax from
Mr. Krane was pushed under his hotel room door at 3 a.m. "I
have reviewed your numbers and they aren't high enough," Mr.
Krane wrote. "I insist you come back with sales on the six
pictures of $20 million." Mr. Milner says he brought sales on
those pictures to just over $4 million.
   Buyers also backed off as MCEG failed to deliver movies.
"Jonathan always said pre-sales covered production costs and
it was never true, with the exception of `The Chocolate
War,'" says Mr. Milner.
   Yet MCEG was still growing rapidly, acquiring many of the
elements of a major studio, such as domestic home video
distribution. The company hired a high-paid staff last year
to distribute its films in the U.S., a risky move that has
proven lethal to other independents. But there were few
movies ready to distribute and a small budget for promotion.
MCEG moved into a sprawling office here and Mr. Krane filled
it with art, including two paintings of dogs in business
suits.
   "The overhead skyrocketed," says Michael Lauer, a former
head of business affairs. "Krane wanted to have it all."
   MCEG's earnings looked good, at least initially. The
company reported net income of $693,079 for the fiscal nine
months ended Dec. 31, 1988. However, auditors challenged one
transaction, requiring the company to restate its
third-quarter earnings. MCEG then posted a net loss of $2.5
million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1989. Still, Mr.
Krane painted a rosy picture, saying that "unclear accounting
standards" had led the company to defer income on completed
movies.
   Wall Street was happy to provide more cash. Kidder Peabody
&amp; Co., a unit of General Electric, underwrote $27.5 million
in convertible debentures in January 1989. "Our firm belief
in MCEG allowed us to market the securities aggressively,"
Richard Intrator, a Kidder senior vice president, said in a
newsletter. Kidder later helped MCEG create a new security
backed by foreign film receivables, a move that raised
another $20 million. Kidder officials decline comment.
   As recently as last September, Kidder analyst Christopher
P. Dixon issued a buy recommendation, writing, "MCEG is
superbly positioned to benefit from the globalization of
American entertainment." Mr. Dixon didn't return calls for
comment.
   At the Cannes Film Festival in France in the spring of
1989, Mr. Krane and two other top officers stayed in suites
at the posh Hotel du Cap Eden Roc at a cost of about $20,000
each for the 10-day period. The company, which spent nearly
$1 million at the festival, gave a lavish party to promote a
lengthy list of movies.
   MCEG released only three films last year, all box-office
duds, including "Getting It Right," a British comedy that won
some positive reviews.
   Executives say Mr. Krane frequently screamed that MCEG was
his company and the movies were his movies. Staff members
recall that Mr. Krane twice held staff meetings at his home,
about 45 minutes from the office. They say he sat in a
high-back leather chair and kept his back turned to the group
throughout the meetings. "So," he asked with his hands behind
his head, "what's been going on?"
   Close associates say Mr. Krane suffers from Tourette
Syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes muscular
twitches and sometimes involuntary verbal sounds. While Mr.
Krane exhibited some of the symptoms, executives say he
rarely discussed the condition. Experts say the Syndrome
affects people differently; some have difficulty in
controlling impulsive behavior such as swearing and angry
outbursts.
   One executive who attended the staff meetings in his home
said Mr. Krane's behavior didn't appear to be related to
Tourette Syndrome.
   Former associates question Mr. Krane's role in paying more
than $40,000 to Eliza Simons, a casting director. While Ms.
Simons did work on movies, former executives believe she was
overpaid on certain projects. MCEG issued a check to Ms.
Simons for $10,000 for "casting services" on two movies the
company never made, "Uncle Bob" and "Late Knight." Ms. Simons
says she wasn't hired as a casting director on those movies
and did "very little work" on the projects.
   When asked about the check, she says, "I don't remember. I
was handling so many shows at the same time." Ms. Simons says
she has known Mr. Krane since she was 13. "He was my
boyfriend in camp," she says. "We held hands."
   The move that pushed MCEG toward the edge was the July
1989 acquisition of Virgin Vision Ltd., a British-based
international distribution company, for $83 million. Analysts
considered the deal overpriced and there were significant
unresolved legal questions about distribution rights. Before
the acquisition, both companies were suffering from cash-flow
problems. But Kidder Peabody rallied again, providing a
bridge loan of $67 million.
   Within a month, MCEG issued bonus checks to Mr. Krane and
Charles J. Weber, then president and chief operating officer,
for $200,000 and $150,000 respectively, on top of salaries of
$577,782 and $350,000. The payments outraged some other MCEG
executives, who say the board hadn't approved the payments.
   "The checks weren't written before the board approved it,"
Mr. Krane says. "Every procedure was followed." Yet the bonus
checks are dated Aug. 25 and the board didn't meet to approve
the bonuses until Nov. 12, company records show.
   Mr. Weber, who declines comment on the bonuses, resigned
after the board approval and says his departure was amicable.
   Insiders worried that the company was rudderless. In a
November letter to co-founder Mr. Rouhana, Colin Hurren, then
executive vice president, suggested forming an executive
committee. "We need a `counter weight,' a `balance' if you
will to the operational and management style of our
chairman," he wrote. "We must demonstrate that the ship is
being `steered.'" Mr. Hurren declines to comment on the
letter but says, "There were good executives who told the
emperor he wasn't wearing any clothes."
   That became clearer when MCEG went into default on the
Kidder Peabody bridge loan last December. Mr. Rouhana says
the lending climate made refinancing impossible. Losses
snowballed to $14.9 million for the nine months ended Dec.
31, 1989, and Kidder sold the problem loan to GE Capital as
part of a larger portfolio.
   MCEG still hasn't filed its financial statement for the
fiscal year ended March 31. "There were optimistic policies
with respect to the accounting," says Raymond Godfrey, the
current president and chief operating officer.
   Meanwhile, work on six movies has ground to a halt. The
company has released only one movie this year, "Without You
I'm Nothing," based on comedian Sandra Bernhard's
off-Broadway show, which the company also financed. The movie
was distributed by New Line Cinema Corp. as part of a
distribution agreement signed in May.
   Mr. Krane now is producing "Look Who's Talking Too," the
sequel, again for Tri-Star, a unit of Sony Corp. And Mr.
Travolta, the star, has remained a supporter. "He has been
the best thing that happened to my career in 10 years," the
actor says of Mr. Krane. "He's a great friend and he wants to
take care of you in a parental way."
   That isn't how some former employees feel. Several vented
their frustration on a papier-mache cow in MCEG's lobby. The
black-and-white cow, which is balanced on one leg atop a
magenta ball, was a gift from Ms. Kellerman to her husband.
At first, several executives just spit on the cow. But one
livid employee finally knocked it over and thrust a letter
opener into its side. "It's not funny," says Mr. Krane. "They
stabbed it."
