   JAPAN'S MINISTRY OF FINANCE first auctioned stock in
state-owned Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. in 1987. It
last offered shares to the public in 1988. At the time, NTT's
stock traded at just below two million yen a share, down from
a high of 3.12 million yen in April 1987. In Tuesday's
edition, the history of the stock price was reported
incorrectly.
