   Swissair was dealt a blow in efforts to control costs when
the planned sale of its hotel unit, Swissotel AG, to the
Aoki/Westin Group of Japan fell through.
   The national airline, 23%-owned by Swiss federal and
cantonal authorities, signed a letter of intent in March to
sell its interests in 16 luxury hotels to the Japanese
construction and hotel group that owns Westin Hotels &amp;
Resorts of the U.S. Swissair cited "uncertainty in world
financial markets" and the complexities of the deal for the
sale's collapse.

   Analysts had valued Swissotel at as much as 750 million
Swiss francs ($565 million).
   An airline spokeswoman said the strengthening Swiss franc
against the yen and the dollar made Swissotel more expensive
for Aoki. Further, there were difficulties in financing the
four U.S. hotels in the chain, she said.
   Swissair in March said it wanted to sell the unit because
substantial investment would be required to develop Swissotel
into a viable international chain.
