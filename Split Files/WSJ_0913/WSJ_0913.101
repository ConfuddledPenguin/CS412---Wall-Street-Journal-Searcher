   Company-Owned Arby's
   To Accept Credit Cards

   THE TRICKLE of credit cards into fast-food outlets is
about to grow: Arby's Inc., the No. 7 sandwich chain, plans
to start accepting credit cards soon at all 245 company-owned
restaurants.
   Though a number of fast-food chains, including Kentucky
Fried Chicken and Burger King, have experimented with credit
cards, Arby's will be the first to go national. Over time,
Arby's expects many of its 2,055 franchised units to accept
them as well.
   Like other fast-food chains, Arby's was reluctant to slow
service for credit-card approvals. But it wanted to take
advantage of the cards' potential: In test markets, people
tended to spend 40% to 60% more at Arby's when they didn't
have to shell out cash.
   "Places like Denny's and Shoney's already take them, and
with some good marketing and incentives, they can spread in
fast food, too," says Kurt Peters, editor of Credit Card
News. MasterCard International, which is participating in the
Arby's program, says credit-card sales in fast-food
restaurants could top $1 billion annually in the next six
years.
   With a computer system using a "bad guys" list, Arby's has
cut credit-card approval time to less than a second from the
20 to 45 seconds required for standard bank authorizations.
Card numbers will be checked against a file listing stolen,
canceled and over-the-limit credit cards. The list is sent
daily via satellite by the maker of the system, MerchanTec
International, Tucker, Ga.
   Relying on the negative file has risks. Stolen cards don't
show up right away, so bad cards can slip by. But fast-food
places face small losses since their average sale is far
lower than that of most stores.
                                                                                                       

   Households Display
   Childlike Eating Habits
                                                                                                       

   EVEN AS you read this, you or someone you know may be
trapped in a Kids in Control home.
   So named by NPD Group Inc., a Port Washington, N.Y.,
market-research firm, these homes represent about 19% of all
U.S. households. And in them, people wolf down more
kid-oriented food.
   Most of these homes have kids. But fully 43% don't; in
these homes, the adults just eat like children. They zap more
food in the microwave, and taste is one of their main
motivators in deciding what to eat.
   These people snap up peanut butter, jelly, snack cakes,
ketchup, pizza, fish sticks, cold cereal, macaroni and
cheese, cold cuts, ready-to-eat popcorn, Velveeta and dips.
They shun fresh fish, decaffeinated coffee, oatmeal, skim
milk, sugar substitutes and meatloaf.
   In Kids in Control homes, the adults -- with or without
children -- care little about health and a lot about price.
They are less cautious than others about salt, cholesterol,
preservatives, fat and sugar, and they favor generic and
store-label brands over national or regional ones.
   Represented mostly by two-parent families, Kids in Control
homes are somewhat more blue-collar and tend to be located in
the Northeast and Midwest.
                                                                                                       

   Dispatches From Coke
   And Pepsi in Cola Wars
                                                                                                       

   REMEMBER Coca-Cola's MagiCans? They may be back in 1992.
   Coke marketing and technical officials met several weeks
ago, say people familiar with the meeting, to discuss what
went wrong with this summer's promotion and how it could be
resurrected.
   Under a crush of bad publicity about the prize-filled
cans, some of which didn't open properly, Coca-Cola cut the
promotion short in June. But Coke insiders are still enamored
of the idea, which boosted sales substantially. Even while
discussing a 1992 relaunch date, however, Coke wants to
ensure that all technical flaws are erased. And so far, no
managers are pushing hard for the project. Coke says no
decision has been made on a relaunch.
   PepsiCo's Cool Cans, meanwhile, may return in the form of
Yule Cans.
   Over the summer, Pepsi-Cola lined store shelves with
brightly illustrated Cool cans. On one can, a surfer rode a
wave; another can displayed a woman wearing sunglasses with
Pepsi logo lenses. After the success of that promotion, the
company confirms it is now considering Yule Cans, which might
use yuletide graphics.
                                                                                                       

   Using 3-D Pitches
   To Attract Business
                                                                                                       

   IN TRYING to lure new businesses, Richmond, Va., doesn't
just fire off chamber of commerce letters and glossy photos
of downtown landmarks.
   It sends toasters, gavels, baseballs, harmonicas,
compasses, Civil War bullets, thermometers, seashells and
calculators shaped like matchbooks.
   The calculators? They bear the message, "Add up the
reasons {Richmond} is the perfect match for your business."
Toasters? "Another major headquarters just popped up in
Richmond."
   The approach might sound hokey, but it gets results. In
the past three years, about 50 businesses have built or moved
headquarters, manufacturing or distribution plants or
divisions to Richmond. Omni Products International Inc.
recently opened a patio-furniture factory in Richmond. The
marketing ploys "helped emphasize the good points about the
city," says Richard Barker, Omni's president.
   Richmond started this all with an item or two about 10
years ago, and in recent years it has expanded its offerings.
"Executives are bombarded with all kinds of mail, half of
which is screened out by their secretaries," says A.J.
Christopher Wood, executive director of the Richmond area's
development council. "We decided to try three-dimensional
mailings to get into their offices."
