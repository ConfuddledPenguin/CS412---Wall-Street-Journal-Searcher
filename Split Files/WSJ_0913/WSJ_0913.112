   Tokyo stocks rose sharply Wednesday on spurts of
broad-based buying by investment trust funds, traders said.
   In London, stocks fell, as Iran's call for a "holy war"
against the U.S. wiped out earlier gains.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 611.48 points,
or 2.49%, to 25216.14. Volume on the first section was
estimated at 530 million shares, up from 405.9 million shares
Tuesday. Advancers outnumbered decliners 762 to 217, while
144 issues were unchanged.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index inched up another
20.85 points to close the morning session at 25236.99.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section rose 33.02 points, or 1.76%, to 1913.72.
   The Second Section index dropped 11.85 points, or 0.33%,
to 3591.55. Volume in the section was estimated at six
million shares, in line with 5.9 million shares Tuesday.
   Traders also said that futures-related activity picked up
in the second half of the trading day, with both domestic and
foreign brokerage houses unwinding long futures positions and
buying back cash stocks.
   Futures and options traders said that only some
institutional clients are backing the securities firms on the
arbitrage buying, with most of the activity targeted for
house profits.
   Because life insurance companies and other institutions
must pay commissions to the actual arbitragers, the companies
usually don't find it profitable to participate heavily in
arbitrage activity, futures traders said.
   But some institutional investors are still trying to
settle short arbitrage-linked positions, making it possible
that they were buying to cover Wednesday, traders said.
   Straight buying by investment trust funds, which was
scattered in small lots during the morning session but
increased in the afternoon, provided the basis for support on
the cash indexes, participants said.
   Traders estimated that 100 billion yen to 300 billion yen
($712.9 million to $2.14 billion) of funds may hit the market
by the end of the week.
   Although well-absorbed by the investment trust and
arbitrage buying Wednesday, arbitrage selling all day and
general bearishness in the morning about interest rates and
higher oil prices confronted the buying, traders said.
   The stock market was a little moody at the beginning of
the day because Japanese government bonds had opened weaker
after a softer performance overseas, traders said. But a
sharp appreciation by the yen sparked short-covering in the
bond market, soothing stock market sentiment in the
afternoon.
   Stock transactions were thin and swift, meanwhile, as much
of the day's activity was dealer-driven and based on
speculative or incentive-backed shares, traders said.
   Also, because Thursday is the last day of trading for
September futures and options contracts, while Friday is the
special quotation for those contracts, stock traders
reiterated that volatility can be expected.
   Steel shares were sharply higher. Daido Steel jumped 40
yen to 715 yen, Kawasaki Steel rose 28 yen to 458 yen, Kobe
Steel gained 37 yen to 527 yen, and Nisshin Steel was up 17
yen to 665 yen.
   Several speculative issues continued to attract buying
interest. For example, Sanrio rose 260 yen to 6360 yen and
Jujo Paper rose 50 yen to 670 yen.
   Oil and related product shares also rose, with Nippon Oil
up 20 yen to 1070 yen, Showa Shell up 80 yen to 1130 yen, and
Mitsui Petrochemical up 34 yen to 824 yen.
   Some construction shares also gained. Misawa Homes rose 50
yen to 1950 yen, Maeda Construction was up 70 yen to 1640
yen, and Ohbayashi rose 50 yen to 1290 yen.
   Gains on blue-chip issues were less impressive, however.
Pioneer rose 70 yen to 4850 yen and Fujitsu gained 30 yen to
1210 yen. But TDK fell 70 yen to 5680 yen and Sony dropped 20
yen to 7020 yen.
   Shipbuilding, real estate and financial issues rose.
   London traders said it was difficult to assess the
direction of that market, and that decisions could be made
only on a minute-by-minute basis.
   Prior to the Iran's call for war, London traders reported
general institutional buying. "Institutional cash piles were
beginning to look slightly embarrassing," one trader said.
However, profit-taking set in after the news, forcing the
London market lower, traders added.
   One trader said that the London Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 Share Index still needed to drop 30 points to
generate buying interest, and to allow London to fall closer
in line with Wall Street.
   Wednesday, the FT-SE 100 fell two points to 2142.3. The
Financial Times 30 Share Index was down 7.7 points at 1643.3.
Volume was 434.7 million shares, up from Tuesday's 338.8
million shares.
   Traders said that BTR PLC, an industrial holding company,
was the main feature of the market. Although the half-year
pretax profit rose 6.6% to #530 million ($983.1 million), the
figure failed to match expectations. BTR plunged 40 pence to
318 pence.
   Among other companies disclosing half-year results,
insurance giant Prudential PLC reported a decline in pretax
profit of 35% following claims involving winter storm damage.
The stock managed to gain 4 pence to 208 pence on the back of
optimistic expectations for overseas units.
   British Aerospace PLC posted a 0.7% fall in pretax profit
to #146 million, but remained optimistic about full-year
earnings. The shares gained 11 pence to 563 pence.
   In the wake of Iran's call for a holy war, oil prices
rallied and Lasmo gained 12 pence to 481 pence. Enterprise
Oil climbed 9 pence to 678 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Frankfurt, Zurich,
Milan and Brussels, lower in Paris and Madrid, mixed in
Amsterdam, and flat in Stockholm. South African gold stocks
edged up.
   Shares also ended higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei,
Wellington and Singapore, and lower in Manila and Seoul.
