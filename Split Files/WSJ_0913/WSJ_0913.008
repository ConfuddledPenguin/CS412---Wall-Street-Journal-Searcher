   Thursday, Sept. 13, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "48 Hours:
Murder, U.S.A." A graphic special edition on our murder rate,
now high enough for the U.S. to claim honors as the homicide
capital of the world. The evidence Dan Rather and company
have gathered in support of this thesis is both grisly and
convincing, if not exactly news to most people. Some of the
closeups are fairly gory, others notable for other reasons,
such as the scenes in which the art of loading and shooting a
gun is taught to an enthusiastic band of middle American
wives and mothers, one of whom announces -- and who can doubt
her? -- that this is better than housework.

   Thursday, Sept. 13, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "Gabriel's
Fire" is more like a sputter in danger of dying thanks to the
extreme windiness of its script, about a virtuous former
convict who teams up with an equally sanctimonious female
defense attorney. The high oratory here is such that even the
estimable James Earl Jones (Gabriel) may be unable to effect
a rescue.
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, Sept. 18, 9-11, on PBS (PBS air dates and times
vary so check local listings): "Frontline: The Decade of
Destruction," the beginning of a four-part series on the
decimation of the Amazon rain forest. Offered free land in
exchange for homesteading, Brazilian migrants slashed and
burned their way through the primeval trees in order to clear
farmland that soon lost its power to grow crops. It is a
seductively narrated story mingling themes of pursuit,
revenge and an eerily evocative war between settlers and
Indians, except that this isn't a Western, and the Indians
padding around with bows and arrows are not members of the
Screen Actors Guild. If only for the pictures the two hours
spent watching this would be well spent. (Parts two, three
and four air Wednesday-Friday, 10-11 p.m.)
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Sept. 19, 8-8:30 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Lenny," one
of the season's better new sitcoms. This is about a
blue-collar sort, portrayed with wry vigor by comedian Lenny
Clarke. The real find here though is Lee Garlington, who
gives a clever, nuanced performance as Lenny's wife-no easy
thing in a script evidently determined to obey this season's
fashion, which dictates at least a sprinkling of coarseness.
The last line's gratuitous vulgarity makes that determination
clear. Scriptwriters capable of imagining a line like it for
an ending are capable of any perfidy. This caveat aside, the
rest of "Lenny" shows a warmth and sparkle that ought to win
audiences.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Sept. 19, 8-9:30 p.m., on PBS: "Adlai
Stevenson: The Man From Libertyville." In 1952, for those not
around at the time, Illinois Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson ran for
president against Dwight Eisenhower, former supreme allied
commander in the European theater of operations, and
Stevenson lost -- badly -- as he would do again four years
later. That should have been the end of the story, but
Americans, including the notables who appear in this film,
knew Stevenson would never be just another failed candidate.
He was a legend, enshrined as few also-rans have ever been,
so it is not surprising that all these decades later we have
this TV biography, reverentially narrated by Gregory Peck.
Can you imagine this sort of emotional memorialization being
offered 38 years from now about, say, George McGovern? Lauren
Bacall is here too, still looking starry-eyed as she talks
about Stevenson. A lot of Americans like her were in love
with him -- there is no other word for it -- in a serious
way, and this film, with its clips of that piercing smile,
that voice with its stately, but humor-drenched cadences,
will make them remember why. Many more citizens, of course,
loved Eisenhower, but what Stevenson's admirers felt was a
passion of a different order. He elevated politics with his
wit and eloquence, and no one who saw him so would forget
him. In addition to all this, for many people, this surely be
the only chance in their lifetimes to behold a candidate who
actually had to be drafted, pushed and shoved, before he
would accept the presidential nomination -- at least the
first time.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Sept. 23, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "The Queen of
Mean," is the monarch of the Helmsley hotel chain, Leona
Helmsley, famed, among other unfortunate utterances, for her
alleged observation that "only little people pay taxes." Try
as she will, Suzanne Pleshette just does not have the
coarseness to make a true hotel queen. Lloyd Bridges, who
admittedly has a rather easier job of it, is on the other
hand splendid as the silent Harry, a weary old man who once
was a veritable Fred Astaire on the dance floor, as we see
here. Mawkish in its psychologizing and also in a lot of
other ways, "Leona" still is indisputably entertaining,
especially if you like a little embarrassment with your
movies.
