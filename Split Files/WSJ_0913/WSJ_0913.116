   Cambridge Capital Fund L.P., which holds 14.1% of
Whitehall Corp., said it may seek seats on Whitehall's board
even though it lost a proxy contest in May.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Cambridge
said it is concerned about the continuing deterioration in
Whitehall's operations. Last month, Whitehall reported a
second-quarter loss of $359,000, or 11 cents a share,
compared with year-earlier profit of $380,000, or 11 cents a
share. Revenue fell 53% to $4.1 million.

   Cambridge said it is considering the solicitation of
written consents from holders, or the calling of a special
meeting, to remove some or all of Whitehall's directors and
replace them with its own nominees.
   Whitehall officials couldn't be reached. A Cambridge
attorney wouldn't comment.
   In the filing, Cambridge also said it raised its stake to
14.1%, or 478,300 shares, including 23,600 shares bought from
Aug. 24 to Tuesday at $11.50 to $12.125 each.
