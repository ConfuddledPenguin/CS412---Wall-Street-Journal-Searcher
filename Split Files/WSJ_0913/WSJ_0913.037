   TW Holdings Inc. said it is making two prepayments
totaling $70 million on senior debt, reflecting "better than
anticipated" operations.
   TW, which in December 1989 acquired TW Services Inc., the
giant food-services concern with 1989 revenue of $3.5
billion, said a $40 million prepayment made yesterday was
applied to four quarterly principal payments of term A senior
debt, scheduled to begin Dec. 1.

   TW, a Spartanburg, S.C., provider of food, vending and
medical services said the other $30 million, which it plans
to pay today, will reduce the bridge portion of its senior
bank loan to $267.5 million. The company said it expects to
pay off the balance of the bridge loan by Dec. 1 with
proceeds from planned asset sales and real estate financings.
   Karl Sedlarz, vice president and treasurer, said cash flow
has been better than expected, largely because of controls on
capital expenditures and strong revenue, which rose 7.7% in
the six months ended June 30 to $1.8 billion from $1.67
billion a year earlier.
   TW owns Canteen, the big contract food and vending
service, Denny's restaurants, and the Quincy's Family
Steakhouse chain, and is the largest franchisee of Hardee's
restaurants.
   Coniston Partners, the New York-based investment concern,
and associated parties control TW Holdings.
