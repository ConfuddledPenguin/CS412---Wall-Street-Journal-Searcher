   Kansas Power &amp; Light Co. is the previously unidentified
third party negotiating to rescue Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co.
from an $857 million hostile bid from another local utility,
according to people familiar with the situation.
   However, the same people said the talks between the two
utilities haven't progressed very far.

   They and some takeover stock traders theorized that
disclosure of the talks late Tuesday by the target, Kansas
Gas &amp; Electric, may have been aimed at getting the first
bidder, Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co., to increase its
$27-a-share offer.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Kansas Gas &amp; Electric's stock rose $1.25 to $25.75
in response to its disclosure after the market closed Tuesday
that it has begun acquisition talks with an unidentified
third party.
   Yesterday, Kansas City Power &amp; Light, based in Kansas
City, Mo., asked to be given "equal opportunity with other
parties" to negotiate an acquisition of Wichita-based Kansas
Gas. Kansas Power &amp; Light is based in Topeka.
   One reason some traders were skeptical about Kansas
Power's chances of acquiring Kansas Gas is that Kansas Power
carries a somewhat smaller stock-market value than Kansas
Gas. "You've got an $800 million company trying to buy a $1
billion one," said one.
   Officials at Kansas G&amp;E and Kansas P&amp;L couldn't be reached
to comment late yesterday.
