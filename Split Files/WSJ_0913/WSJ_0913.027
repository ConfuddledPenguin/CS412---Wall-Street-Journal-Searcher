   General Dynamics Corp. said James Mellor, an executive
vice president responsible for the company's submarine and
tank-making divisions as well as its overseas sales, will
become president and chief operating officer at the beginning
of the year.
   Mr. Mellor, 60 years old, succeeds Herbert Rogers, who
previously had indicated his intention to retire soon but
will now become vice chairman.

   The two appointments stress important trends at General
Dynamics, a major defense contractor. First, Mr. Mellor's
promotion underscores the increasing role of international
sales at U.S. defense companies in general and General
Dynamics in particular; in his present role at the St. Louis
company, which he has played since 1986, Mr. Mellor has
concentrated on marketing M-1 tanks and F-16 jet fighters
abroad. As the U.S. defense budget is cut, success overseas
will become more crucial.
   Mr. Rogers's decision to stay on indefinitely, meanwhile,
is a sign of how much the company is determined to turn
around the A-12 aircraft line at its Fort Worth, Texas,
factory, where the 65-year-old General Dynamics veteran is
now on special assignment. In the second quarter, the company
recorded a $450 million charge on the A-12 program, which is
experiencing delays because of what Navy officials have
described as design problems and excessive weight.
   "We've got real heavy firepower on it" to rectify the A-12
situation, said William Anders, who is the company's current
vice chairman and who was named in September 1989 to become
chairman and chief executive officer when Stanley Pace
retires at the end of this year.
   Mr. Mellor was unavailable for comment yesterday. But Mr.
Anders, in an interview, described his colleague as "a solid,
instinctive businessman."
   "Besides being an experienced man, he is a pleasant
no-nonsense guy," Mr. Anders added. In a statement, Mr. Pace
said of Mr. Mellor: "He combines a technological know-how and
business sensitivity that will be invaluable in helping Bill
Anders guide the company through the difficult but opportune
times ahead."
   Mr. Mellor, an electrical engineer, joined General
Dynamics in 1981 and before that held various posts at
several defense companies, including Litton Industries Inc.
He was also president and chief operating officer of AM
International Inc., a graphics equipment concern in Chicago.
