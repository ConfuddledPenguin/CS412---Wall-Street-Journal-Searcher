   OTTAWA -- A group of oil companies led by Mobil Oil Canada
Ltd. is expected to sign an agreement tomorrow to develop the
big Hibernia oil field off Canada's east coast.
   The US$4.4 billion project will be Canada's largest and
most expensive energy development, and industry analysts
predict it will spur further development of Canada's offshore
oil resources.

   Separately, the government approved the development of
another smaller oil project off the Canadian east coast.
   Hibernia, discovered more than 10 years ago, is expected
to produce 110,000 barrels of oil a day for 20 years starting
in 1996. Most of the oil is expected to be shipped to
refineries in the U.S. Northeast.
   Hibernia's prospects have brightened as a result of the
Persian Gulf crisis, which has pushed oil prices to their
highest levels in almost 10 years.
   Still, the project has been widely criticized by some
industry analysts who claim it wouldn't be economical without
the heavy financial support of the Canadian and Newfoundland
governments. Both governments are due to sign the Hibernia
development agreement tomorrow.
   The Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney announced that it would contribute $2.3
billion in grants and loan guarantees to the project just
before it called a federal election in November 1988.
   The Newfoundland government, anxious to generate
employment in the province, has agreed to forgo some taxes on
the project.
   "We're bringing onstream probably the most expensive
production in the world," said Ian Doig, editor of Doig's
Digest, an industry newsletter. Mr. Doig estimated that it
will cost almost $33 a barrel to develop Hibernia. He said
about another $1 billion would have to be spent to shut down
the field when its reserves run out. Mr. Doig said the nearby
Terra Nova oil field could be developed at a fraction of
Hibernia's cost.
   Newfoundland Energy Minister Rex Gibbons said Hibernia
would generate "a very quick payback to Canada." He estimated
that Hibernia would be profitable with oil prices as low as
$14 a barrel. At current prices, Hibernia would produce
"significant profits," Mr. Gibbons said. West Texas
Intermediate, a benchmark crude, was quoted yesterday at
$30.95 a barrel.
   Some industry analysts said Hibernia will encourage
development of other east coast oil discoveries including the
Terra Nova and White Rose fields, all off the coast of
Newfoundland province. Only one well is currently being
drilled in the eastern offshore region, but Mr. Gibbons said
the area could produce as much as 200,000 barrels of oil a
day once Hibernia and other fields start production.
   Hibernia's development has been repeatedly delayed because
of low oil prices and jurisdictional disputes between the
Canadian and Newfoundland governments. In recent months,
negotiations between the oil companies and the Canadian and
Newfoundland governments were stalled by disagreements over
where contracts for Hibernia's work will be placed.
   "What should have been the trigger project for a complex
of offshore fields has degenerated into an exercise in
regional politics," said Frank Dabbs, an energy writer, in
Canada's Financial Post newspaper.
   Mobil Oil Canada has a 28.1% stake in Hibernia. Its
partners include Gulf Canada Resources Inc., which is
controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, with 25%;
government-owned Petro-Canada, 25%; and Chevron Canada
Resources Ltd., a unit of San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,
21.9%. Mobil Oil Canada is a unit of New York-based Mobil
Corp.
   A government agency approved plans by a Canadian unit of
London &amp; Scottish Marine Oil PLC, or Lasmo, to develop two
oil fields off Nova Scotia province. The fields are due to
start production in 1992, before Hibernia, making them the
first developed oil fields off the North American coast.
   Lasmo Nova Scotia Ltd. and its partner Nova Scotia
Resources (Ventures) Ltd., a provincial government agency,
plan to recover 35 million barrels of light oil from the two
fields over six years. The fields, known as Cohasset and
Panuke, are expected to cost $134 million dollars to develop.
   The fields contain a high-grade condensate that can be
used to make jet fuel and can be blended with heavier crudes.
   Petro-Canada is expected to submit to government
regulators this year its plans to develop the Terra Nova
field. The field is expected to contain 300 million barrels
of crude and production is expected to begin in the
mid-1990s. Terra Nova's development is expected to cost about
$1.7 billion.
