   WASHINGTON -- The budget negotiators' goal of reducing the
federal deficit by $500 billion over the next five years is
"considerably more modest" than is needed, the General
Accounting Office said.
   The investigative arm of Congress said a $500 billion
package would be only "a first step" and ought to be followed
by an even larger $550 billion round of deficit reduction in
fiscal 1996 and 1997.

   In its 140-page report, the GAO said the government ought
to run a surplus to ensure that the nation saves more and
invests more for the future. By 1997, the GAO said, the
surplus should equal 2% of the gross national product, the
total output of the economy. "The average deficit as a
percent of the GNP has doubled every 10 years for the past 40
years," the GAO said. It is now at about 4% of GNP.
   As a result, interest payments are the fastest growing
item in the budget. "Current projections indicate that debt
service costs will replace defense as the largest item in the
budget by 1992," the GAO said.
   Separately, the director of the Congressional Budget
Office, Robert Reischauer, said that the slowing U.S. economy
and the effects of the Persian Gulf crisis could push the
deficit as high as $267 billion in fiscal 1991 without some
action by Congress and the White House. In July, the office
put the deficit at $232 billion.
