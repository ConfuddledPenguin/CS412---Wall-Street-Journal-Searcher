   PONTIAC, Mich. -- Mazda Motor Corp. launched its Navajo
sport-utility vehicle, the first vehicle made by a Big Three
U.S. auto maker to be sold in the U.S. by a Japanese company.
   The Navajo is a two-door version of Ford Motor Co.'s
popular Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Ford builds the
Navajo, Mazda's first sport-utility vehicle, at the same
assembly plant in Louisville, Ky., that produces the Ford
Explorer introduced earlier this year. Ford owns 25% of
Mazda, and the two companies have extensive product
development alliances.

   Mazda set the base price for the Navajo at $17,560. The
auto maker projects annual Navajo sales in a range of 15,000
to 20,000 vehicles. The Navajo is only available in a
two-door; the Ford Explorer is offered in both two-and-four
door models.
   Mazda this week began its television advertising campaign
for its 1991 vehicles, including the new Navajo
sport-utility. Footage for the television commercials was
shot in Ship Rock, N.M., "in the heart of Navajo lands," said
Clark Vitulli, chief operating officer of Mazda Motor of
America Inc. "The television creative builds on the strong
Navajo name and the heritage and imagery it implies," he
said.
   Mazda features North American Indians in the advertising
campaign but says it won't make any mention that the Navajo
sport-utility is American-made, Vitulli said. "I don't think
people care where it was manufactured or where it came from,"
he said.
   Mazda also said it will raise base prices of some its 1991
models by less than 1% to 4.5% from 1990 levels. Mazda didn't
increase the base price of its popular Miata two-seater,
leaving it at $13,800. But it raised the starting price of
its cheapest car, the 1991 Mazda 323 hatchback, by 4.5% to
$6,899 from $6,599.
   The Protege compact sedan base price was raised to
$10,999, or 4.3% from $10,549 a year ago. Mazda said it
upgraded the interior and exterior trim and replaced an
entry-level model in the Protege line-up.
