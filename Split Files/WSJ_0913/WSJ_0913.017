   ROCKY HILL, Conn. -- Ames Department Stores Inc. reported
a second-quarter net loss of $152.5 million, or $4.15 a
share, but said that operating losses weren't as bad as it
had expected.
   The discount retailer, which is operating under Chapter 11
protection of the federal Bankruptcy Code, said the loss
widened from a restated loss of $11.1 million, or 38 cents a
share, in the year-ago quarter.

   Stephen L. Pistner, who took over as Ames chief executive
officer in May after the bankruptcy-law filing, said the
company's losses before nonrecurring charges were
"significantly less than we expected because of
better-than-expected summer clearance sales."
   Ames said that before the nonrecurring charges, its
operating loss was $79.4 million. Nonrecurring charges
include a $40 million adjustment of accounts payable during
the bankruptcy claims filing process, a $20 million reserve
for inventory markdowns and a $9.1 million write-off of
certain management information systems.
   Ames sales declined 54% to $563.3 million from $1.22
billion.
   Ames started racking up big losses last year after
acquiring the Zayre discount store chain in an ambitious
expansion attempt. Many of the Zayre stores proved to be
money-losers, and Ames closed 221 of them in June.
   Mr. Pistner said that during the quarter Ames "essentially
restarted the business," getting suppliers to start shipping
merchandise again and resuming advertising.
   For the six months, Ames net loss widened to $583.4
million, or $15.71 a share, from $27.5 million, or 90 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell 33% to $1.55 billion from
$2.33 billion.
