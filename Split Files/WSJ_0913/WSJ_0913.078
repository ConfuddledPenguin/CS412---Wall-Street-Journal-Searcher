   British Aerospace PLC said pretax profit for the first six
months eased 0.7% to #146 million ($270.8 million) from #147
million a year earlier.
   The results, which matched market expectations, were
damped by a #28 million charge related to a prolonged
industrial dispute at the aerospace division of British
Aerospace, which is one of the country's largest industrial
concerns with interests in auto making and property
development.

   Profit after taxes and minority interests, or net profit
attributable to shareholders, was unchanged at #102 million.
Earnings per share eased 0.3% to 35.6 pence from 35.7 pence.
Despite the flat earnings performance, the company said it
will boost its interim dividend to 8.9 pence a share, up 9.9%
from the 8.1 pence paid in the year-earlier first half.
   Sales climbed 20% to #4.79 billion from #4 billion a year
earlier.
   The company said cost-reduction programs helped profit
margins in several divisions, including both commercial
aircraft and defense equipment.
