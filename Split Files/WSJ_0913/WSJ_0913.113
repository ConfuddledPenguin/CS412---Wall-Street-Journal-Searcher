   The Ford Foundation launched a program to help combat
racism on college campuses.
   The foundation announced $1.6 million in grants to help 19
colleges and universities add courses that deal more directly
with such issues as cultural diversity, ethnic heritage and
racial oppression. The initiative comes at a time when many
campuses -- and the nation as a whole -- are dealing with
outbreaks of racial prejudice and tension.

   "To reach the roots of intolerance and improve campus
life, we must make the teaching of non-Western cultures a
basic element of undergraduate education, said Franklin
Thomas, president of the New York foundation. "The minority
population under the age of 18 in the U.S. has risen from 15%
in the 1950s to 36% today, and the number is still growing.
As the face of America changes, education must help American
students learn to live and work together," he said.
   Foundation officials said that the grants are just the
first step in what will be a multiyear program involving
other institutions.
