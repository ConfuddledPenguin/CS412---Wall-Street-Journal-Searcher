   Landmark Land Co., Carmel, Calif., said federal regulators
subjected its Oak Tree Savings Bank unit to operating
restrictions because of insufficient capital.
   Landmark said the "supervisory agreement" includes limits
on new lending and certain other actions, including the
payment of dividends and the hiring of directors and
employees, without clearance from the federal Office of
Thrift Supervision. Landmark said the restrictions are
customary for thrifts that fail to meet higher capital
standards established under last year's thrift-bailout law.
It added that Oak Tree, based in New Orleans, had already
been curtailing its lending since the beginning of the year.

   Landmark also said that it received "several proposals" in
reply to a plan to sell much of Oak Tree's real-estate
holdings but that it couldn't predict whether a sale would be
completed. An earlier agreement to sell nearly $1 billion in
real estate to developer Barry Hon collapsed because of
regulatory objections.
