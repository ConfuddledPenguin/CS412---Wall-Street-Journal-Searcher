   DeKalb Genetics Corp. estimated that per-share earnings
for its fiscal year ended Aug. 31 rose 20% on a 7% increase

   The DeKalb, Ill., company said all three of its businesses
-- seed, swine and poultry -- contributed to the improved
performance. Its largest business, hybrid seed corn, will
report increased sales in the U.S., driven by both higher
planted corn acreage and increased market share for its corn
hybrids.
   DeKalb also said it estimates that its return on equity
exceeded 1989's 12.2%, but that it didn't reach its near-term
goal of 15%.
