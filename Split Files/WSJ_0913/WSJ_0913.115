   NEW YORK -- Yields that topped 8% attracted a large number
of individual buyers to New York City's $850 million general
obligation bond issue.
   But the high yield, which translates into a taxable
equivalent yield of more than 12% for many individuals,
wasn't high enough to lure many big investors. Dealers said
institutions considered the yields too low in light of New
York City's financial troubles.

   Still, officials at lead underwriter Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
said the issue was oversubscribed due to strong demand by
individual investors.
   "We had very strong retail demand throughout," said Dan
Keating, senior managing director of municipal underwriting
at Bear Stearns. "Institutional business was scattered in the
shorter and longer maturities."
   The New York City issue was priced to yield from 6.50% for
two-year notes to 8.05% for 30-year bonds. Moody's Investors
Service Inc. confirmed a single-A rating on the issue while
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. confirmed a single-A-minus rating.
   Investor reaction to the New York City sale spilled over
into the rest of the municipal bond market, helping
tax-exempts to outperform the broader bond market.
   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point
higher, a gain of $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
But Treasury, corporate and mortgage-backed bonds ended
unchanged to as much of 1/8 point lower in quiet trading. The
yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.94%
from 8.92% on Tuesday.
   Mitchell Held, economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said the Treasury market opened with a "nice little
runup," which reflected optimism that congressional
negotiators would soon forge a credible budget-reduction
plan. That was considered good for bonds because many
economist argue that a smaller budget deficit could lead to
lower interest rates.
   But later in the day, bond prices slid on news that Iran's
spiritual leader, Ali Khameni, said that the U.S. military
presence in the Middle East justifies a Moslem jihad, or holy
war.
   Mr. Held said the pronouncements raised the specter of
still higher oil prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,
crude oil futures contracts for October delivery settled at
$30.97 a barrel, up 21 cents on the day.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Yields topping 8% attracted many individual buyers to New
York City's $850 million general obligation bond issue.
   But the high yield, which translates into a taxable
equivalent yield of more than 12% for many individuals,
wasn't high enough to lure many institutional investors.
Dealers said the institutions considered the yields too low
in light of New York City's financial troubles. Still,
officials at lead underwriter Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said the
issue was oversubscribed.
   The New York City issue was priced to yield from 6.50% for
two-year notes to 8.05% for 30-year bonds. Moody's Investors
Service Inc. confirmed a single-A rating on the issue while
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. confirmed a Single-A-Minus rating.
   In competitive action, an issue of $100 million Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power electric plant revenue
bonds sold out immediately after they were purchased by a BT
Securities Corp. group, officials at the firm reported. BT
Securities is a unit of Bankers Trust Corp.
   The bonds, rated double-A by Moody's and S&amp;P, were priced
for reoffering to yield from 6.40% for six-year notes to
7.39% for 30-year bonds.
   Meanwhile, Swiss Bank Corp. said it would not back $50
million of Philadelphia temporary loan notes. Philadelphia
had been expected to sell about $375 million of the notes
this week, with proceeds intended to keep the city afloat
financially until tax collections begin. Without the note
sale, Philadelphia officials have said the city will run out
of cash later this month.
   "The deal has definitely been postponed," said Alan
Schankel, first vice president and manager of the municipal
bond department at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia. "I think they'll go back to the drawing board
and try everything," such as trying to obtain another letter
of credit or getting the state more involved with the sale,
he said.
   Mr. Schankel quoted Philadelphia general obligation bonds
8 1/4% due in 2009 as trading late yesterday at 96 to yield
about 8.60%. Trading halted for about one hour after the
Swiss Bank news. After it resumed, bond yields rose slightly
before returning to the 8.60% level.
   Elsewhere yesterday, most municipal bonds were unchanged
to 1/8 point higher.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended at a price of 97
28/32 to yield 8.94% compared with 98 2/32 to yield 8.92% on
Tuesday. The latest two-year notes ended unchanged at 100
5/32 to yield 8.02%.
   Short-term securities were lower yesterday. The discount
rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.37% for a bond
equivalent yield of 7.59% while the rate on six-month bills
fell to 7.30% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.66%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Resolution Trust Corp.'s junk-bond sales put a damper
on the high-yield market, sending prices moderately lower.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, fell 1/4 to 1/2
point.
   The declines came after the RTC sold $70 million of junk
bonds Tuesday and was seeking to sell another $40 million of
high-yield bonds yesterday.
   A spokeswoman for the RTC, the federal agency set up to
bail out the nation's troubled thrifts, said the RTC managed
to sell between two-thirds and three-quarters of the $40
million in bonds. "We could have sold them all but we were
not happy with the prices," she said.
   Although the spokeswoman declined to say which junk bonds
the RTC was trying to liquidate, dealers said the list
included a number of cable TV companies, including Century
Communications Co., American Cablesystem and Comcast Corp. On
Monday, the House passed a bill that would regulate cable TV
rates for basic service and assist emerging competitors.
   Among the big losers in the high-yield market were junk
bonds of AmBase Corp., which plunged a day after the company
said its Home Insurance Co. unit has discontinued
negotiations to sell US International Reinsurance Co.
   AmBase's 14.875% senior subordinated notes, maturing in
1998, tumbled six points to 61.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds ended unchanged to slightly lower.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage securities ended with slim gains.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue
for September delivery rose 2/32 to 98 7/8. The 9 1/2%
securities of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal
National Mortgage Association each rose 3/32 to 98 14/32 and
99, respectively.
   Lehman Brothers announced the pricing of a $300 million
Fannie Mae real estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic,
issue. The 16-class deal, Series 1990-123, is backed by
Fannie Mae's 9 1/2% securities. Details were not immediately
available.

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The World Bank managed to sell its third and largest
global bond issue yesterday but underwriters said it wasn't
easy.
   The $2 billion of 8 5/8% five-year notes were priced
within expectations but the latest tremors from the Persian
Gulf, coupled with tough market conditions, nearly derailed
smooth placement.
   "This was a deal which people had to work for," said
Walter Henniges, head of syndication at Deutsche Bank Capital
Markets Ltd., the joint lead underwriter with Salomon
Brothers International Ltd. "The Treasury market was very
nervous and this was a very difficult market to work in."
   In addition to negative talk from Iran, underwriters had
to contend with lukewarm demand from Japanese investors. The
dollar's weakness and the prospect of lower rates in the U.S.
while Japanese yields are increasing muted demand.
   European investors, who have previously been more willing
to buy World Bank bonds than U.S. or Japanese investors,
picked up only 35% of the issue.
   West German and British government bonds closed moderately
lower after earlier gains were wiped out after an Iranian
call for a "holy war" against the U.S. presence in the Middle
East.
   In Japan, government bonds rose.
