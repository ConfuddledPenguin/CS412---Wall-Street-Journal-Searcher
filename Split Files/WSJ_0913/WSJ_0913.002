   PARIS -- Matra S.A. of France, a defense and electronics
concern, said it received a contract from Norway to supply
its navy with Mistral surface-to-air missiles. Matra didn't
disclose the value of the agreement but said this is the
largest defense materials contract ever signed by France and
Norway.
   The company said Norway represents the 11th Mistral
customer to date, while the Norwegian navy is the fourth
defense force to entrust its ship defense system to Matra's
product.

   Matra said the accord includes an industrial cooperation
agreement, effective immediately, that is expected to open
the door to defense-related projects linking French and
Norwegian companies.
