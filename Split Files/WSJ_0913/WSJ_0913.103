   WASHINGTON -- Senate appropriations subcommittees plunged
into a set of disruptive fights over how to meet new funding
commitments on issues ranging from the United Nations to AIDS
treatment and law enforcement.
   Practically all new funding for a landmark AIDS relief
bill would be deferred for 12 months under allocations
approved yesterday as part of an almost $176.4 billion health
and education measure for fiscal 1991. And while fulfilling
President Bush's commitment to increase U.S. donations to the
U.N., two of the principal authors of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law first had to bust
their own budget for an estimated $19.7 billion bill covering
the State, Justice and Commerce Departments.

   The AIDS and U.N. issues are sure to be revisited by the
full Appropriations Committee, and the maneuvering is a
harbinger of the conflict ahead as lawmakers come to terms
with the even tighter spending limits being set by the
current budget negotiations between Congress and the White
House.
   Advocates of increased funding for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome said offsetting cuts could be found
within the existing limits, but as the budget talks ratchet
down the numbers further, these choices will be more
difficult in the weeks before November's election.
   As approved yesterday by the subcommittee, an estimated
$2.17 billion is budgeted for AIDS-related research and
treatment, but any expenditure of the $490 million allocated
for state and city grants under the bill would be deferred
until Oct. 1, 1992. The impact falls most directly on such
cities as New York, San Francisco and Miami, which were
targeted for funds, and the decision met bitter criticism
from advocates of increased AIDS treatment and counseling.
   "The provision is hollow without real dollars," said Tom
Sheridan of the AIDS Action Council, adding: "No money means
lost lives."
   Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), chairman of the health and
education subcommittee, has won praise from the same
organizations in the past for his support of AIDS funding.
But up for re-election, he appears bent on using available
funds for education and health services with more immediate
impact on his constituents. Rural health and Alzheimer's
research funding would double to almost $593 million, and
both Head Start and compensatory education programs for
disadvantaged elementary school students would be increased
substantially from current funding.
   From the outset this year, Mr. Bush has emphasized the
need for the U.S. to better meet its obligations to the U.N.,
and this pressure has only increased with the Mideast crisis.
In line with this request, the bill approved yesterday by the
state, justice and commerce subcommittee provides an
estimated $908.6 million for international organizations and
peace-keeping operations; the entire measure is approximately
$600 million over budget.
   The action could invite other subcommittees to follow
suit, and is all the more ironic because the major sponsors
-- Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and Sen. Warren Rudman
(R., N.H.) -- played such a role in designing the present
budget process.
   Though the largest single element, the U.N. funding is
only part of the overrun, and members increased money
elsewhere for law-enforcement accounts including expanded
investigations into savings-and-loan fraud.
   In a related decision, the subcommittee voted to extend a
$5 inspection fee to air and sea passengers entering the U.S.
from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, which are currently
exempted from the charge. First adopted in 1986, the fee
serves to defray the costs of Immigration and Naturalization
Service inspectors. By ending the current exemption, the INS
hopes to raise $83 million annually to cover the cost of
1,000 new staffers.
