   The dollar sank to a 13-month low against the yen, and
many traders think it will fall even further.
   Expectation of lower U.S. interest rates played a role in
the drop, as did massive sales of dollars and European
currencies by Japanese companies that want to bring home
profits they have earned abroad.

   "There is absolutely no reason to buy dollars vs. yen,"
said Belal Khan, a corporate trader at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New
York. He added that the difference in yields between
dollar-denominated and yen investments had shrunk "so much
that the Japanese might as well keep their money at home."
   In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 138.09 yen,
down from 140.30 yen on Tuesday. The U.S. currency rose to
1.5913 marks from 1.5855 marks a day earlier. Meanwhile, the
pound edged up to $1.8594 from $1.8580 on Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 137.35 yen, down from 138.30 yen at the close there
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5935 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5820
marks.
   The dollar's latest slump follows its retreat this summer
against the mark and other European currencies. Since 1989
ended, the dollar has fallen 4% against the yen, nearly 6%
against the mark and 13% against the pound. Late last month,
the U.S. currency fell to its lowest rate against the mark
since the German currency was established after World War II.
   Yesterday, the dollar fell to its lowest point during
European trading -- 137.47 yen, or 14% below its high for the
year of 159.79 yen, set on April 3. The currency then
recovered a bit as traders who sold the dollar short took
profits by buying dollars back. A month ago, the U.S.
currency was trading as high as 150.45 yen. Its previous low
was 137.20 yen, set on Aug. 3, 1989.
   "Whatever's been going on in this market, it's totally a
yen play," said Joseph Volpicella, foreign-exchange trading
manager at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York. "It's going to
continue until at least the end of September or until
{Japanese companies and banks} get their books the way they
want them."
   The first half of the fiscal year for most Japanese
corporations and financial institutions ends Sept. 30. And
the need to boost earnings, or at least to reduce trading
losses, is prompting many multinational Japanese companies to
cash in profits they have in overseas markets and bring the
money home.
   "Japanese banks, institutional investors and multinational
corporations have been repatriating profits back to Japan to
dress up their books," said Mr. Khan of Fuji Bank. "Some of
the institutional investors feel the U.S. is no longer a
place to have their money because the U.S. is headed for a
recession, and that a {U.S.} budget agreement may be agreed
to by Sept. 28" -- the last business day of the month. Some
traders and analysts believe a budget agreement would allow
the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy and lower U.S.
interest rates.
   Analysts said that data assembled by Japan's Ministry of
Finance shows that in the first six months of this year,
Japanese investors sold a net $8.9 billion of U.S. stocks and
bonds. Japanese institutional investors are so eager to
"dress up" their books for the accounting period ending Sept.
30 that traders attributed yesterday's dollar rise against
the mark and other continental European currencies to sales
of those currencies against the yen.
   The dollar is often used as an intermediary in such
"cross-rate" transactions. For instance, a trader seeking to
buy yen and sell marks might initially sell marks for dollars
and then sell the dollars for yen. Such trades tend to boost
the U.S. currency against its German counterpart while
weakening it against Japan's currency.
   "People are speculating on a U.S. budget deficit cut,"
said Yoichi Sakaguchi, chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in New
York. He conceded that "this is the same old story: waiting
for the U.S. to reduce its deficit." But Mr. Sakaguchi added
that he and others in the currency market thought President
Bush's address to a joint session of Congress -- unlike
earlier speeches -- was "decisive on a budget deficit cut."
   If U.S. interest rates do decline, the dollar could fall
further. That's because lower rates usually reduce a
currency's allure to international investors. Similarly,
higher Japanese interest rates would increase the appeal of
the yen. Even though the Bank of Japan raised its discount
rate -- at which it lends to financial institutions -- 0.75
percentage point to 6% late last month, many traders and
analysts believe the central bank will boost the official
rate again to counter domestic inflationary pressures.
   Indeed, a major underlying reason for the dollar's
weakness against most foreign currencies is the expectation
of lower U.S. rates and higher rates abroad. Three-month
Eurodollar deposits -- dollars that are deposited outside the
U.S. -- currently yield 8.125%. That compares with 8.438% for
equivalent yen deposits, 8.375% for marks to be delivered
three months hence and 14.875% for pounds.
   In addition, the dollar continues to be burdened by a
softening U.S. economy and the large U.S. budget deficit. So
far, these economic factors have overshadowed the dollar's
traditional role as a "haven" currency during times of
international tension. Many traders believe the dollar won't
reacquire its status as a haven as long as Iraq and the
nations allied against it try to deal with the Mideast crisis
diplomatically rather than militarily.
   At the same time, most analysts believe the fast-growing
Japanese economy is better prepared than the U.S.'s to cope
with the inflationary and trade-deficit effects of higher oil
prices.
   The major assault on the dollar occurred early Wednesday
during Asian trading hours, a trend of the last several days.
"We are in a situation now where New York is kind of the
clean-up market; the big moves are occurring in Asia," said
John Lyman, a senior corporate dealer at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
in New York.
   He said that the attack began with Federal Reserve
Governor "Martha Seger's comment that traditional easing by
the Fed may not be enough to avert a {U.S.} recession."
   Traders said that their Japanese counterparts also
unloaded dollars on a Tuesday report by the U.S. General
Accounting Office that 35 large U.S. banks are in danger of
failing. Adding fuel to the fire were a series of rumors,
subsequently found to be baseless, concerning a discount-rate
increase by the Bank of Japan, a U.S. budget accord and the
flight of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Dealers said the dollar's fall accelerated when it dropped
below 138.80 yen, a key support level on charts used by
traders to predict currency movements. Mr. Khan of Fuji Bank
said that 135.80 yen was another key level.
   Mr. Sakaguchi of Sanwa Bank predicted that the dollar will
possibly continue to weaken to about 135 yen by the end of
the month. Other analysts and traders agree.
   The yen is also expected to climb against European
currencies. Mr. Lyman of Bank of Tokyo said that a rate of 82
yento the mark "is very possible," down from 86.778 yen late
Wednesday. On Tuesday, one mark bought 88.489 yen.
   "People suddenly noticed the uncertainty surrounding the
unification of Germany, the high cost" associated with it.
"So they are buying yen against marks or other
Eurocurrencies," said Mr. Sakaguchi. "This is a kind of
unwinding operation, after Japanese investors had bought
European currencies several months ago."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $382.10 an ounce, up $1.60. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $382.25 an
ounce.
