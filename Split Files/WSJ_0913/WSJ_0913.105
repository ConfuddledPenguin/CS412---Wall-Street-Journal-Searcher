   U.S. Shoe reported a 29% drop in profit for the second
quarter because of a slowdown in sales at its LensCrafters
Optical stores, previously the company's fastest growing
unit.
   In the second quarter, the company earned $1.9 million, or
four cents a share, compared with $2.6 million, or six cents
a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales were $671.4
million, compared with $583.2 million.
