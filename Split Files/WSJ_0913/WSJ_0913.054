   WASHINGTON -- Sharon Pratt Dixon, a former Democratic
National Committee treasurer, won the Democratic primary for
mayor of the District of Columbia, topping a field of five
contenders.
   Ms. Dixon is running to succeed Marion Barry, whose plans
to seek a fourth term were cut short by his widely publicized
trial and conviction on a misdemeanor cocaine-possession
charge.

   Ms. Dixon, 46 years old, faces former Police Chief Maurice
Turner, a 55-year-old Republican, and a handful of other
candidates in the November election. Ms. Dixon, who trailed
her rivals throughout the primary, now enters the fall
campaign as the favorite in a city where Democrats outnumber
Republicans 8-1. Ms. Dixon surged in the final days of the
campaign on the strength of a surprise endorsement by the
Washington Post and a strong anti-incumbent message.
   Former Carter administration civil rights official Eleanor
Holmes Norton overcame last-minute disclosures that she
hadn't filed local tax returns to win the Democratic
nomination for the city's nonvoting delegate seat in
Congress. She said her husband was responsible for family
finances and neglected to tell her. She faces Harry
Singleton, a former Reagan administration official. The
winner will succeed Walter Fauntroy, a longtime civil rights
activist who gave up a seat he had held for 19 years to run
for mayor.
   And the Rev. Jesse Jackson, in his first bid for local
office, won one of two unpaid positions as a "shadow" senator
to lobby for statehood for the district.
   In Connecticut, Rep. Bruce Morrison won a close race for
the Democratic nomination for governor. He will face former
Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker, who is running as an
independent, and the GOP nominee, Rep. John Rowland, who had
no primary opposition.
   In New Hampshire, Gov. Judd Gregg was nominated for a
second term as governor. He will face state Democratic Party
Chairman Joseph Grandmaison, who won a close race against
state Senate Minority Leader Robert Preston.
