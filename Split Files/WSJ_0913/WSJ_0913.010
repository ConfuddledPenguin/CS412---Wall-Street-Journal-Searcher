   WASHINGTON -- Government investigators accused the
Education Department of significant shortcomings in its
management of the guaranteed student-loan program, which is
plagued by defaults of more than $2 billion annually.
   James Thomas, the department's inspector general, said the
government's approach for policing schools that participate
in the loan program "is all too often a paper chase." In
testimony before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, he said that the department's "accrediting,
eligibility and certification system is not effective in
protecting federal funds from misuse or in protecting
students."

   In addition, a report by the subcommittee's staff accused
the Education Department of "serious shortcomings in the
current oversight system," particularly as it applies to
proprietary schools, which train people for such jobs as
hairdressers and truck drivers. Trade schools generally have
the highest loan-default rates. The staff charged that the
department certified schools "even when they have clear
indicators of administrative deficiencies."
   Last year, the department announced a new initiative to
discipline or close schools with high loan-default rates. And
earlier this week, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos
announced steps designed to force the agencies that accredit
schools to do a better job.
   Yesterday's hearing was the latest in a series of
congressional inquiries following the July disclosure that
the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, which has
guaranteed some $9 billion in student loans, is on the brink
of collapse because too many of its loans are in default. The
administration currently is reviewing proposals from United
Student Aid Funds, another guarantee agency, and the Student
Loan Marketing Association to take over HEAF's portfolio. A
decision is expected later this month.
   Under the federal loan-guarantee program, students who
attend accredited schools are eligible to apply for loans.
The government doesn't accredit schools directly. Instead, it
relies on about 100 accreditation agencies which, in turn,
are subject to Education Department review. In addition, the
department must certify that the schools are properly
accredited. The investigators charged that the department was
too lax in both procedures.
   In an effort to tighten procedures, Mr. Cavazos said the
department plans to review the activities of agencies that
have accredited schools that have unusually high default
rates. According to 1988 data released by the subcommittee
staff, students at about 70 of some 8,400 accredited schools
accounted for half of the default volume. And all of these 70
schools were accredited by only seven of the about 100
accrediting agencies.
   One of the reasons HEAF got into trouble was that it
guaranteed a large volume of loans to students at proprietary
schools, many with high default rates. Tommy Downs, who left
a prison where he was sentenced for defrauding the
student-loan program to testify before the panel, called HEAF
"a school owner's dream and a source of almost instant money.
. . . Almost anyone could get a loan through HEAF if they
could figure out how to fill in the blanks on its
computerized forms and deal with its easy-to-satisfy,
Kelly-girl-type administrative personnel."
   However, Mr. Downs conceded, it was a secretary who
discovered that a proprietary school he ran was illegally
collecting money from the government by submitting loan
applications for nonexistent students and triggered the
investigation that sent him to prison.
   Richard Hawk, the chairman of HEAF, said that Mr. Downs's
criminal conviction "was in large part the result of the
diligent efforts of HEAF personnel. . . . We regret that an
unscrupulous trade school representative convicted of student
loan fraud knowingly took advantage of HEAF's efficient and
effective service in abusing the student loan program."
