   In New York City's tottering real estate market,
apparently no one is immune.
   Even William Zeckendorf Jr., among the city's busiest and
most cautious developers of the 1980s, is now being whipsawed
by tight credit and declining real estate values.

   Although Mr. Zeckendorf's empire has appeared solid even
as those of other big developers have faltered, Mr.
Zeckendorf is being forced to restructure loans on two of his
biggest projects.
   In a move that people close to the developer say would
reinvigorate his empire, Mr. Zeckendorf is negotiating to
sell a major portion of his company to Tobishima Corp., a
Tokyo-based construction company, in exchange for a cash
infusion. But that deal appears far from completed, say
people familiar with the negotiations.
   "I have seen the ups and downs in these markets, and in
order to make a stronger company, we should have stronger
partnership links," said the 60-year-old Mr. Zeckendorf in a
telephone interview from Japan. "We're going into an era
where overleveraging is not the thing to do."
   In purchasing equity in Mr. Zeckendorf's company, a
Japanese company would be primarily acquiring both his
development expertise and the cachet of the Zeckendorf name.
Such a transaction would be in line with a Japanese pattern
of low-profile investments in U.S. real estate, despite the
recent purchases of such trophies as Pebble Beach and a
controlling interest in Rockefeller Center.
   Yukio Furuya, a spokesman for Tobishima, said that the
company hasn't decided if it would accept Zeckendorf's
proposal but that its response would be made before the end
of the month.
   Mr. Furuya stressed that the transaction wouldn't be a
takeover but would be set up as an equally owned U.S. joint
venture to earn fees for real estate development planning and
marketing. He declined to discuss the possible capitalization
of the venture.
   Tobishima has been involved in a $150 million
community-development project in Mahattan in a partnership
with Zeckendorf since last fall. The Japanese company started
its U.S. operation in 1985 through the establishment of a
unit, Los Angeles-based Tobishima U.S.A. Inc., and now
operates 13 units and affiliates in the U.S. involved in
construction and real estate development. Annual sales in the
U.S. last year totaled $25 million.
   Mr. Zeckendorf's challenge is particularly poignant
because, a quarter century ago, he watched helplessly as the
real estate empire of his father, William Zeckendorf Sr.,
fell into bankruptcy. "The ghost of Bill Zeckendorf Sr. seems
to be in the closet of one of his offices," says one
associate.
   The junior Mr. Zeckendorf has been meeting with his
lenders, which include Bank of Montreal and Equitable Life
Assurance Society of the United States, for at least the past
three months to restructure loans on projects that aren't
making enough to cover their interest payments. Because Mr.
Zeckendorf offered minimal personal guarantees on the
projects, his liabilities aren't believed to exceed $5
million. He said arrangements have already been made with his
lenders that will allow him to retain his equity interests.
   Mr. Zeckendorf is far from the only developer who is under
the gun. In Atlanta, John Portman is in emergency meetings
with his creditors on $2 billion in loans. In New York City,
a slew of developers are reportedly in workouts with their
bankers.
   People close to Mr. Zeckendorf's creditors say, in fact,
that his lenders have no desire to force his hand, and will
likely give him time to work out his problems. "Banks will do
things for him that they might not do for others," said one
banker who has worked with Mr. Zeckendorf. "People look at
him with more fondness than others."
   Mr. Zeckendorf's style of operation contrasts sharply to
that of another New York real estate mogul. Unlike Donald
Trump, who recently completed a $65 million bailout with his
bankers, Mr. Zeckendorf was extremely conservative, even in
the go-go '80s. Mr. Zeckendorf worked with partners to
minimize his own risk; he avoided making ego-driven purchases
of trophy properties; and he kept a relatively low profile in
the town where builders could become celebrities on the
strength of one project.
   Employing this low-key approach, he put together over two
dozen projects during the decade. He built condominiums on
Central Park and office buildings in once-seedy areas such as
Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen and Union Square.
   He built upscale hotels and midpriced apartment houses,
and an office condominium in the middle of midtown. In the
only project that bore his name, Zeckendorf Towers, located
on Union Square, he made clear that the project was named
after his late father, not himself.
   In an odd twist that could have landed him in more trouble
than he is already in, he once represented an investment
group that offered Mr. Trump $550 million for a vacant West
Side rail site that real estate experts say has far less
value today. Luckily for Mr. Zeckendorf, the deal didn't go
through.
   Mr. Zeckendorf's current problems appear to result partly
from bad luck and bad timing. In two projects converted from
old Gimbel's department stores, construction overruns
approached a total of $100 million. However, Mr. Zeckendorf
wasn't the partner in charge of the project; New York City
developer Larry Silverstein had that responsibility.
   Even though Mr. Zeckendorf sold nearly all of his equity
interest in the projects early on, he guaranteed to the banks
that projects would be completed within budget, say people
familiar with the situation. Mr. Zeckendorf's potential
exposure for the overruns is about $5 million, according to
an individual familiar with the deals.
   Mr. Silverstein declined to comment, as did Bank of
Montreal and Equitable Life Assurance.
   To make matters worse, Mr. Zeckendorf, like other New York
developers, is feeling the sharp effects of tough economic
times. Over 300,000 square feet of office space once occupied
by Integrated Resources Inc. at Zeckendorf Towers in Union
Square now sit vacant as a result of that company's collapse.
A Times Square hotel and office complex Mr. Zeckendorf built
also has over 200,000 square feet of vacant office space.
   In addition, Mr. Zeckendorf has at least five condominium
projects yet to be fully sold, in a market that brokers say
gets worse with each passing day.
   One reason that Mr. Zeckendorf appears to be having
trouble weathering the slowdown is that he never realized
enormous profits even from his most successful projects in
the 1980s.
   In order to limit his risk and allow himself to undertake
as many projects as possible, he preferred to sell his
ownership interest in the early stages, sometimes even before
the project broke ground. Among real estate cognoscenti, he
was known as a "fee" developer -- someone who took short-term
fees in return for stitching deals together.
   "I think he's made a lot of people richer than he's made
himself," says Jack Shaffer, a mortgage broker with
Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp., which helped Mr. Zeckendorf raise
$1 billion to help finance some of his early projects.
   In an industry filled with flamboyant entrepreneurs, the
60-year-old Mr. Zeckendorf cuts an oddly unflashy figure. In
meetings, he often can be seen chewing on the end of his
reading glasses; sometimes, he speaks so softly that he can't
be heard. Colleagues describe him as coming from the
old-school of real estate, where deals were cemented with a
handshake.
   He lives on Park Avenue in Manhattan with his wife, a
retired ballerina, and has generally avoided the champagne
society, preferring to spend time horseback riding in his
upstate New York country home or at his Santa Fe, N.M., home.
   Mr. Zeckendorf's quiet demeanor stands in stark contrast
to his larger-than-life father, with whom he apprenticed
starting at age 14.
   No man was more responsible for reshaping the downtowns of
modern cities than was the senior Mr. Zeckendorf. He built or
planned Mile High Center in Denver, Century City in Los
Angeles, and Place Ville-Marie in Montreal. He built giant
malls in Long Island and industrial parks across Canada, and
drilled for oil off the coast of Surinam. His most enduring
achievement was probably the assemblage of the land where the
United Nations now sits.
   But while he wasn't afraid to build, he was equally
fearless when it came to borrowing money, saying, "I'd rather
be alive at 18% than dead at 12%." Ultimately, the senior
Zeckendorf suffered from the same overconfidence that has
afflicted other fallen developers. His empire collapsed in
1965 when Marine Midland Bank called in an $8.5 million note.
