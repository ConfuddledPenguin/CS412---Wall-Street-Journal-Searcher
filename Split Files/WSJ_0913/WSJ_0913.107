   NEW YORK -- Investors poured $2.4 billion into money
market mutual funds in the latest week.
   Assets of the 435 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report increased $1.1 billion, to $399.9 billion,
the Holliston, Mass., newsletter said. The average seven-day
compounded yield, which assumes reinvestment of dividends,
remained at 7.75% in the week ended Tuesday.

   Money fund portfolio managers lengthened the average
maturity of taxable funds' investments by a day, to 47 days,
indicating that the managers expect short-term interest rates
to decline. "They want to lock in the higher yields," said
Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's. The funds invest in
such things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.
Average maturity is now the longest it's been since August
1987.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
remained at 7.47%. The average 30-day simple yield slipped to
7.48% from 7.49%, and the average 30-day compounded yield
eased to 7.76% from 7.77%.
   Assets of 231 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's rose
$1.3 billion to $81.2 billion, a record, the newsletter said.
The average seven-day compounded yield rose to 5.54% from
5.43%. The latest yield is equal to 7.69% for an investor in
the 28% tax bracket and 8.27% for someone paying 33% in
taxes.
   The average maturity of the tax-exempt funds remained at
59 days.
