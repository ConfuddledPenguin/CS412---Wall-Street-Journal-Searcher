   WASHINGTON -- The current lull in saber rattling may
obscure it, but President Bush is likely to face a stark
decision sometime this fall over whether to use a military
strike to oust Iraq from Kuwait.
   Barring unexpected developments, the Bush administration
now intends to sit tight without making big policy changes
for at least the next several weeks, senior administration
aides say. During that period, the White House will wait to
see whether economic sanctions are really squeezing Iraq, and
the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf will be
completed as shiploads of big tanks arrive.

   Then, at some point in October or November, Mr. Bush and
his top aides are likely to sit down together to decide
whether sanctions are inflicting enough pain to force Iraq to
reverse course in Kuwait. If the embargo is seriously
pinching Iraq, the president probably would choose to stay on
his current course awhile longer. And officials insist that
they are optimistic about the sanctions, despite new hints
that Iran may help Iraq circumvent them.
   But there's another scenario that may be more likely: If
the trade embargo is leaking, or if it appears that the
sanctions will take too long to have a real impact, President
Bush will face the question of whether a military strike is
necessary to achieve his unambiguous goal of driving Iraq out
of Kuwait.
   With no meaningful diplomatic efforts under way to find
another course of action, and no certainty that sanctions
alone will do the trick, the odds remain high that,
eventually, the current crisis will turn to war. Rep. David
Obey (D., Wis.), head of the House's foreign-operations
subcommittee, recently returned from a trip to the Persian
Gulf and said he saw "a far better than 50-50 chance" of
fighting.
   Administration officials will talk only vaguely about
their precise timetable for such decisions. "What we'll be
watching for over the next few weeks are signs that the
sanctions are in fact biting," says a senior administration
official. "If they are having an effect, then clearly that's
a guide to future action." Another U.S. policy maker says he
"wouldn't be surprised if by another month we had more
indications than we have now."
   Because of the administration's current focus on
sanctions, Mr. Bush didn't explicitly threaten military
action in his nationally televised speech to Congress this
week, only saying elliptically that "all options" are being
considered. But a variety of signs indicate that while the
odds of a military conflict right now don't seem high, they
begin escalating starting in October and November.
   "My view is that we will continue on this track for the
next eight weeks," says Barry Rubin, an analyst at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who has closely
followed the evolution of U.S. policy since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. "By the time we get to Nov. 15 or
mid-December, there are a number of factors that come
together."
   By that time, as administration aides note, it will be
clearer whether sanctions are working. In addition, enough
time may have passed for the U.S. to argue credibly to the
world community, which it wants to keep united in opposition
to Iraq, that it has given economic and diplomatic pressures
ample time to work against Saddam Hussein.
   At the same time, U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf will have reached full strength. Despite the
rapid rise in the number of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, to
more than 100,000 today, they have lacked the large numbers
of tanks U.S. military commanders would want in any
full-fledged fight with Iraq. Those tanks arrive by
slow-moving ships.
   There also is the chance that if the confrontation with
Iraq isn't resolved by winter, U.S. public support and the
morale of troops camped in the Arabian desert may begin
eroding. That could push the administration to bring the
crisis to a head before then.
   In the fall, of course, Mr. Bush's decision making also
will be affected by a big domestic event: the Nov. 6
congressional and gubernatorial elections. If Mr. Bush were
to contemplate a decision as momentous and politically dicey
as an attack on Iraqi troops, he might want to wait until
after the election has passed. (Some Democrats, on the other
hand, are beginning to worry that Mr. Bush may use an
"October surprise" military action to whip up a patriotic
fervor that would help his Republican Party in time for the
vote.)
   In any case, some analysts suggest that if Mr. Bush
reaches a point at which he concludes that economic sanctions
simply won't be enough, he should pause before turning to
military action and first deliver a clear ultimatum to Saddam
Hussein.
   Such a message would flatly warn that military action is
coming if Iraq doesn't move out of Kuwait within a week or
two. That kind of unambiguous warning might force Saddam
Hussein for the first time to seriously contemplate his fate
if he doesn't reverse his occupation of Kuwait. "The reason
to make it very clear that war is coming is to exhaust the
last chance that he will blink," says William Quandt, a
Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. "It may be
the case that the only way to get someone like Saddam Hussein
to look at the choices confronting him is to make war look
inevitable."
   It's also conceivable, of course, that if the U.S. reaches
a point where it concludes that economic sanctions won't be
enough, it could turn not to the military option but to more
serious negotiations with Saddam Hussein to find a
compromise. Arabs now supporting the tough U.S. stand also
could switch strategies and consider offering Iraq billions
of dollars and land concessions to withdraw from Kuwait.
   But such a course of action seems less and less likely as
Mr. Bush grows more and more definitive in his declarations
that Iraq will be forced to withdraw without any reward.
"Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately and
without condition," Mr. Bush said in his address to Congress
this week.
   Ironically, countries that might want to help Iraq now by
circumventing economic sanctions may actually be increasing
the prospects of war against Baghdad later, when the world
community concludes that sanctions won't produce enough
pressure. But at this point, administration officials insist
that they are pleasantly surprised by how well economic
sanctions are working. They say the flow of goods into Iraq
through neighboring Jordan has slowed to a trickle. And they
doubt that Iran will allow big quantities of food and goods
into Iraq, despite a call by its religious leader yesterday
for a holy war against the U.S. and reports from Tehran that
Iran may send food and medicine in return for refined
petroleum products.
   The question that Mr. Bush and his aides will face this
fall will be how long they can or will wait for sanctions to
have their full effect. "My own belief is that it may be
possible to get Saddam Hussein to withdraw unilaterally
without military action, but the question is whether we're
willing to wait that long," says Mr. Rubin.
