   Armco said it is seeking the consent of its note holders
to amend provisions of the indenture relating to the notes
that prohibit paying dividends on its common stock. Armco
said it needs approval from 50.1% of the $164 million of
notes outstanding to amend the indenture.
   At the close of business Tuesday, consents representing
about $53.1 million principal amount of the notes were
deposited; of this amount, approximately $21.3 million
principal amount of the notes had been tendered and
deposited.
   Armco said it is considering amending its pending consent
solicitation and offer to purchase on or prior to next
Wednesday. If any amendment is made, the solicitation and
offer will be extended further.
