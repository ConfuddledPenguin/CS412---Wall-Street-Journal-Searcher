   EDMONTON, Alberta -- The Alberta government said it
expects to raise 951 million Canadian dollars (US$819.1
million) from an initial public offering of shares of Telus
Corp., the new holding company that owns Alberta's big
telephone utility.
   Alberta telecommunications minister Fred Stewart said the
C$12-a-share issue is the largest equity offering ever in
Canada. He added the offering has drawn "overwhelming"
interest in Alberta, where investors can buy Telus shares for
C$6 each, and pay the balance next September.

   Since investor demand in Alberta exceeded the issue's size
by about C$450 million, Mr. Stewart said the government has
had to limit the number of shares that can be purchased on
the two-part installment plan to a maximum of 900 per
investor.
   Demand for the offering, which is expected to be completed
by Sept. 28, has proven a windfall for the issue's 11-member
underwriting group, led by RBC Dominion Securities Inc. of
Toronto. With trading volumes down sharply this year in
Canada and many securities dealers posting operating losses,
the estimated 3.7% average underwriting and selling
commission earned by dealers on the issue has offered some
welcome relief.
   "It has been a very good issue for us," said Tony Melvyn,
a broker in the Edmonton office of Levesque Beaubien
Geoffrion Inc., a securities dealer based in Toronto.
   The offering of more than 79.3 million Telus shares,
representing a 60% stake in the company, has also drawn heavy
interest from the 11,500 eligible employees of Alberta
Government Telephones, Telus's main subsidiary. About 84% of
the big utility's staff subscribed to the issue, Mr. Stewart
said.
   As previously reported, the Alberta government first
announced in May its plans to privatize Alberta Government
Telephones, which is Canada's third largest
telecommunications concern with assets of about C$2.8 billion
and 1989 revenue of C$1.2 billion.
   The government intends to retain the remaining 40% stake
in Telus for at least a year.
