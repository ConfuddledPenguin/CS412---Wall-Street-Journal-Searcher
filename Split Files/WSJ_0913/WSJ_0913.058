   SMYRNA, Tenn. -- Nissan Motor Co., which has won acclaim
for such performance cars as the sleek Maxima sedan and the
Porsche-like 300ZX, now is pinning its hopes for a U.S.
market resurgence on a subcompact priced to sell for less
than $10,000.
   Nissan yesterday unveiled its new 1991 Sentra at the
monstrous 3.4 million-square-foot factory near Nashville,
Tenn., that assembles the car, as well as compact pickup
trucks. The new Sentra has smooth, flowing lines and a much
peppier engine than the 1990 model. Nissan clearly needs to
build back Sentra sales to regain market share in the long
term.

   "The Sentra is the absolute key to us penetrating the
market," says Wallace Lowenfield, a Nissan dealer in El Paso,
Texas. "We could sell more Sentras than the rest of our car
lines put together."
   Nissan sure needs something hot. Its archrivals, Toyota
Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., are surging ahead in the
U.S. market, and both now have market shares exceeding 9%.
But Nissan's once-promising bid for a comeback from its sales
decline in the late 1980s has stalled. The company took just
4.8% of U.S. car sales in the first eight months of this
year, down from 5.2% in the same period a year ago. The
biggest reason: Sentra sales were down more than 31% from a
year earlier.
   The problem isn't short-term. Nissan's overall U.S. sales
peaked at 831,000 cars and trucks in 1985. But last year,
sales totaled just 663,000 vehicles, and earlier this year,
the company pulled its Axxess minivan off the U.S. market
because it just wasn't selling.
   Now, Nissan says it wants to rebuild its U.S. sales to
900,000 vehicles by the mid-1990s. Another goal is to sell a
greater percentage of higher priced vehicles.
   But Nissan needs to boost sales of its lower-priced models
to keep up with its expanding U.S. production capacity.
Smyrna, which currently assembles 240,000 Sentras and pickup
trucks, will have the capacity to build another 200,000 cars
in two years, probably the next generation of the mid-priced
Stanza.
   The current Sentra, a boxy, undistinguished vehicle, has
needed a replacement for a couple of years, Nissan executives
concede. But Nissan decided three years ago to redo its
upscale "image" cars before tackling the big volume Sentra.
   "To us, those cars were much more critical to our image
and what we wanted to do to it," said Thomas Mignanelli, who
heads Nissan's U.S. sales and marketing arm. "So we
prioritized them in the product cycle and left the Sentra to
last."
   Now, Nissan will see if its new image -- painstakingly
built around its performance cars -- means anything when it
comes to selling the Sentra.
   Nissan is clearly gambling that it will. For starters,
there is the new Sentra's price. It starts at $7,999, a hefty
$600, or 8.1%, more than the current Sentra. And the heavy
incentives used to move the current Sentra won't be offered
on the new model, Mr. Mignanelli said. In effect, Nissan
officials want the Sentra to be perceived as an alternative
to such higher-priced subcompacts as the Honda Civic, instead
of vying for entry-level buyers against such low-priced
models as the Hyundai Excel.
   After incentives, buyers plunked down an average of $7,500
for the old Sentra, said Robert J. Thomas, general manager of
the company's U.S. Nissan division. Now Mr. Thomas wants to
move the average "transaction price" to between $8,500 and
$9,000.
   The big price jump has riled some dealers. Carmen Koosa,
who owns two Nissan dealerships in Southern California, said
the new Sentra will be a "tougher sell" because of the price
increase. Already, many potential Sentra buyers are having
trouble getting financing in today's tight credit market, he
said.
   However, many dealers and analysts say the new Sentra is
such an improvement from the old model that it will do well
despite the price increase.
   "Nissan won't have to have the fire sales on it the way
they have on the old Sentra," says analyst Paul J. Fraker of
Baring Securities Inc.
   Still, Nissan is setting modest sales goals for the new
Sentra, at least for the next year or so. The company expects
to sell 175,000 to 180,000 Sentras in the 1990 model year
that ends Sept. 30, and roughly the same number in the 1991
model year. But Nissan expects Sentra sales to pick up
substantially in the 1992 model year that begins in the fall
of next year, Mr. Mignanelli said.
   During the same period, Nissan will be trying to rev up
sales of its new Stanza compact, which is positioned between
the Sentra and the Maxima in size and price.
   The big decline in Sentra sales this year has been
accentuated by some deliberate actions on Nissan's part,
according to Mr. Thomas. Nissan purposely kept Sentra
inventories lean so that the new Sentra won't sit on the same
showroom with a lot of old Sentras. It was this problem that
plagued the launch of Ford Motor Co.'s Escort budget car
earlier this year. "The difference between us and Ford is
that we've cleared out our '90s," Mr. Thomas said.
   The Sentra isn't the only Nissan car having market
troubles this year. The sporty 240SX was a big hit when
introduced two years ago, but sales are down 25% so far this
year. Nissan is countering that by introducing a restyled
240SX with a bumperless nose.
   Sales of the pricey 300ZX sports car have dropped 18% so
far this year. Nissan has responded by coming out with a
cheaper version of the car without a T-bar roof; it will
start at $27,300, $1,300 less than the cheapest 1990 model.
   The one Nissan car that has shown strong sales gains is
the year-old Stanza. Through August, Nissan had sold 54,481
Stanzas, about twice as many as in the same period a year
earlier. Stanza sales took off earlier this year when Nissan
started an unusual marketing campaign offering $100 to
anybody who test drove a Stanza and then bought a Honda
Accord or Toyota Camry.
