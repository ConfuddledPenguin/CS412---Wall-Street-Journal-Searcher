   Brooklyn, N.Y. -- I am a gardenia "appassionata," having
been smit at birth by a whiff of Gardenia jasminoides in my
native Hawaii. Ever since departing my first garden there, I
have tried to lead a gardenia-accessible life. It has not
been easy.
   Over the years, in sundry overheated, undersunned New York
City caves, I have killed scores of gardenias. After each
gardeniacide I would wait a decent interval and then, ever
the Sisyphean gardener, buy another. I would cart it home in
full bud, Proustily expectant of the first redolent waft of
benzyl acetate-styrolyl acetatelinalool-linalyl
acetate-terpineol-methyl anthranilate-Gardenia Absolute.
Within days the fat green buds would yellow, brownoff and
drop off: The gardenia would drop dead.

   During the '80s I tried self-help in re gardenias. I
consulted Thalassa Cruso's "Making Things Grow." Ms. Cruso
began by aspersion: Gardenias behave like "temperamental
prima donnas" and "only children." She continued by
confession: "I am one of those people who can do nothing with
gardenias." Then, after declaring "advice about gardenias
indoors is very hard to give," she gave her best: "I don't
think a novice should spend money buying such a tricky
plant."
   Regardless, I pushed on to T.H. Everett, the New York
Botanical Garden's late horticultural sachem. He turned out
to be an unmitigated gardenia disparagist. In his epic "NYBG
Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horticulture" (1981), Mr. Everett
dismissed gardenias peremptorily: "They are not good
houseplants. Their environmental requirements are too
exacting"; they will "deteriorate and eventually die."
Liberty Hyde Bailey, in his "Standard Cyclopedia of
Horticulture" (1933), wrote that despite the gardenia's
mid-19th-century rep as "one of the finest stove shrubs in
cultivation . . . it is one of the most difficult plants to
handle."
   Whenever I get really desperate for plant info I call the
Bronx and ask for Lothian Lynas. A crack English research
librarian, Mrs. Lynas is the New York Botanical Garden
Library's Miss Marples. So I called her about gardenias.
Exactly who was the gardenia's Alexander Garden? Besides
Billie Holiday, who wore them in her hair so much they became
her trademark, was there an American angle to the gardenia?
Within the hour Mrs. Lynas phoned with the particulars on Dr.
Garden (1730-91): Scotland-born physician; 30 years resident
in Charleston, S.C.; went back to Britain in 1782 upon
confiscation of his newly American property, he having
remained an English Loyalist during the Revolution;
naturalist; fellow of the Royal Society; friend and
correspondent of naturalist John Ellis. Ellis and Garden both
corresponded with the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus and
each petitioned Linnaeus to name a plant for the other. Mrs.
Lynas reported, "Some miserable little plant -- Ellisia
nycetelea -- got named for Ellis, while the gardenia went on
to glory." The American angle, pre-Lady Day's jazz
immortalization of the flower as camouflage for a cigarette
burn in her hair, Mrs. Lynas related, was that in 1760
Linnaeus had grudgingly bestowed Alexander Garden's name on a
deliriously fragrant plant recently introduced to England
from the Far East, while Dr. Garden was still resident in
colonial America. Linnaeus groused that by calling a gardenia
a gardenia he was "sacrificing science for friendship," and
peeved, "I cannot but forsee that this measure will be
exposed to much censure," considering "the ill-natured
objections, often made against me, that I name plants after
my friends, who have not publicly contributed to the
advancement of science." Mrs. Lynas noted that Dr. Garden
certainly had not contributed to the advancement of gardenia
cultural science. Of two gardenias sent Dr. Garden in 1762,
one was DOA and the other died within a year. A despondent
Dr. Garden wrote Ellis that the gardenia's "sudden death I
take to be no good omen for the continuance and duration of
my botanical name and character."
   Mrs. Lynas invited me up to vet the NYBG's Gardenia File,
a folder filled with many not altogether good-natured
objections to the gardenia's captious character by all manner
of garden griot. "A most cantankerous house plant . . .
Gardenias can make the most secure gardener nervous" (Linda
Yang). "A more finicky flower couldn't have been found"
(Tovah Martin). "I might as well warn you right now that
gardenias . . . are mean plants to handle" (Anonymous). "The
world's most frustrating house plants . . . finicky and
fractious in a living room" (Jeanne Goode). Indeed, Ms.
Goode's gardenia, "a plant that is almost always suffering,"
sounds like a real plant martyr. "More symptoms of distress
can appear on a gardenia in a week than most plants display
in a lifetime. These plants rebel in most houses."
Furthermore, "gardenias are intolerant of mistakes and resent
change." So who'd want to live with one? "There are no
remedies, just things you can do wrong." Clearly I was
unsuited to the gardenia's conservative and imperious
lifestyle. Aside from the standard admonitions to keep up
"atmospheric humidity" ("gardenias grow best in a
rain-forest-type climate") and acidity ("applications of
sulfur") and recommendations for "good, hard syringing" with
"plain water," no gardenia sage advised anything beyond what
I was already doing, or offered much hope of placating the
plants.
   My gardenia enlightenment happened two years ago, on the
day another of my plants gave up the gardenia ghost. A good
gardenia-growing friend from high-rise Manhattan, Edith
Chang, dropped off her gardenias for the summer in my
Brooklyn garden. Quite emphatically she declared that what
gardenias really need is to drop acid fairly often. Mind you,
not just the occasional hit of Miracid, but everyday
breakfast acid: COFFEE GROUNDS] At the time I was trying to
kick the coffee habit. For the sake of my gardenia futures I
now had good reason not to. Instead, I began mixing a morning
slurry of Italian dark roast espresso grounds and using it to
top off the daily gardenia watering with an acid chaser. (At
the same time I made rain-forest-sure that the cachepot
beneath each gardenia held at least 1 1/2 inches of plain
water for daylong pseudo-tropical humidification and soil
moisturizing.)
   I also became an obsessive pest inspector, joining
battalions of ladybugs, green lacewings and praying mantises
on routine patrol of the plants for scale, mealy bug and red
spider mite -- pests that love gardenias as much as I do.
(Lacewings and mantises even like to lay their eggs on
gardenias.) The only other gardenia requisites seemed to be a
bright, sunny indoor winter pot spot and five months'
summering al fresco. (Even the New York City out-of-doors
tones up the plants fast.) Two weeks of fresh-air camp and
the gardenias are flush with buds and shiny new leaves.
   Coffee grounds have made the critical difference in my
relations with these notoriously difficult plants. I haven't
offed a gardenia since 1988. Which makes me wonder why coffee
is never suggested in gardenia-coddling instructions. Could
it be fear of some obscure botanical incest taboo? Both
gardenia and coffee are members of the "Rubiaceae" family,
subfamily "Cinchonoideae."
   My java jive to other gardenia placators: Do not hesitate
to ply the gardenia with the grounds of its near relation,
"Coffea." Share the extended family acidity. By the strength
of strong coffee grounds I've brought two gardenias back from
the brink, nourished one scrawny three-inch mail-order
cutting to flourishing stoveshrub size, and rehabilitated one
massive mealy bug-mauled plant. In the NYC rain forest this
summer, the gardenias of Gotham have performed spectacularly.
I have not been a day without gardenias since May]
   Elvin McDonald of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden once
observed: "So many writers have cast an aura of mystery about
the gardenia and its culture that gardeners sometimes lose
all common sense handling the plant." He admonished:
"Approached calmly, gardenia culture is not any more
complicated than that of such common plants as the African
violet, begonia and geranium." Happily becalmed amid my
gardenias I might add: Gardenias are easy to grow given an
acid enough approach.
