   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Valley Capital Corp.'s Valley Bank unit
said it would continue charging a $1 surcharge on 100 of its
automated teller machines around the state after a federal
appellate court ruled againt a challenge by Plus System.
   The surcharge, levied to ATM customers mostly at machines
in casinos, is unique to Nevada, which passed a law last year
making it unlawful for bank card networks to dictate whether
banks could use the surcharge. Denver-based Plus System Inc.
challenged the constitutionality of that law, which a federal
appeals court upheld.

   Valley Bank had sued Plus System on antitrust grounds
because Plus System refused to cooperate on the surcharge for
its customers. Valley Bank's gross revenue on the surcharge
is about $200,000 a month, according to Jon Joseph, executive
vice president and general counsel. A Valley spokesman said
he expected more Nevada banks to follow suit.
   Plus System attorneys couldn't be reached, and it wasn't
known if they would appeal. The bank-card network is owned by
a group of banks and Visa International Inc.
