   DETROIT -- When General Motors Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union sign a new three-year labor agreement, workers
at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. will know almost line
for line what their new contract will say.
   That's how pattern bargaining works at the Big Three auto
companies, and has worked for nearly 60 years. But after
decades of going along with the UAW's demands for equivalent
pay and working conditions, some Big Three executives are
grumbling that pattern bargaining is hobbling them in
competition with Japanese auto makers. And they argue that
the UAW, itself, is undermining the pattern bargaining system
by granting more favorable terms to Japanese-run factories it
represents, and failing to organize other, non-union Japanese
factories.

   "There is no pattern," declares Chrysler Chairman Lee A.
Iacocca. "We better face up to reality." He says Chrysler
needs a break from the Big Three pattern to stay competitive
with Japanese-run factories whose labor costs are $8 to $12
an hour per worker lower than the range of $31 to $34 an hour
that the Big Three pattern allows.
   UAW leaders don't see it that way, and say they'll fight
Chrysler's efforts to break out of the Big Three pattern this
fall. "This round of bargaining is on pattern and that's the
way it's going to stay," declares UAW President Owen Bieber.
That means the UAW expects the agreement being negotiated at
GM headquarters in Detroit this week will dictate pay and
working conditions at Chrysler and Ford, too.
   But Mr. Bieber's rhetoric can't change the problems the
UAW faces as the U.S. industry undergoes an historic transfer
of power. About 80,000 auto workers in the U.S. now labor for
Japanese companies, estimates Sean McAlinden, a labor
economist at the University of Michigan. As Japanese
companies have expanded, the Big Three have eliminated some
70,000 UAW positions in the past three years alone.
   Some labor experts say this shift illustrates why the UAW
is fighting a losing battle on the pattern issue.
   In other American industries hard hit by Japanese
competition, such as steel and rubber, "we've seen an end to
pattern bargaining," says William N. Cook, a professor of
labor relations at the University of Michigan. "In the future
that may happen in the auto industry."
   In fact, the auto industry pattern is fractured already.
   For starters, there are now five Japanese-owned auto
factories in the U.S. that aren't unionized at all. Just a
decade ago, all major U.S. auto plants were Big Three union
shops. So far, the UAW has failed to organize a Japanese auto
factory where management has opposed representation. The most
recent defeat came last year at Nissan Motor Corp.'s Smyrna,
Tenn., operation.
   Moreover, the UAW is sanctioning different patterns in
auto operations it represents. There's the traditional Big
Three pattern, characterized by multiple job classifications,
generous health and pension benefits, and large union
bureaucracies to enforce contract terms. Under this pattern,
hourly wages are virtually the same at all three companies:
Ford assembly workers make $15.75 an hour, compared with
$15.74 and $15.73 at GM and Chrysler, respectively.
   But there's a different pattern embodied in recent UAW
contracts with U.S. joint-venture factories run by Mazda
Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp., and Toyota Motor Corp.
These agreements feature just two or three job
classifications, allow more flexibility for management and
provide substantially lower labor costs.
   At the Mitsubishi-Chrysler joint venture plant, the UAW
contract allows the operation to run with the lowest staffing
level of any U.S. car assembly plant. Visitors to the
cavernous factory, built on what was a cornfield near
Bloomington, Ill., can walk the distance of a city block in
some places and find almost no workers.
   Perhaps the most glaring variation from pattern the union
has sanctioned is GM's Saturn division operations in Spring
Hill, Tenn. There, workers are paid a salary, 20% of which
depends on how successful the company is.
   The UAW and pattern bargaining aren't to blame for all of
the Big Three's troubles. Consumers who buy Japanese cars
usually do so because they see in those vehicles better
value, more features or higher quality, all factors that
relate to pricing and design decisions controlled by
management.
   But uncompetitive labor costs are a major reason why GM
and Chrysler since 1987 have closed, or plan to close, a
total of nine UAW-represented assembly plants and several
other parts facilities.
   Supporters of the UAW's stand on pattern bargaining say
it's only fair that pay and benefits be uniform across the
industry.
   "Labor costs should not be the basis of competition," says
Irving Bluestone, a former UAW vice president who now studies
labor at Wayne State University in Detroit.
   But labor costs are a key competitive issue even within
the Big Three pattern system because of the vast differences
among the companies. Three years ago, for example, Ford set
the Big Three pattern and used the opportunity to agree to
job-security language it hoped would undermine GM's efforts
to cut its bloated payrolls.
   This year, GM is the target and is expected to seek terms
that will encourage workers to retire. That will help GM get
leaner, but it could hurt Ford.
   Consider GM's plant in Lake Orion, Mich., 15 miles north
of Detroit, where it employs 5,500 workers who build Cadillac
and Oldsmobile luxury cars. Ford operates a similar plant in
Wixom, Mich., 30 miles southwest of there, which also builds
big, luxury cars. But Ford's plant has only 3,300 workers. A
contract tailored to help GM reduce staffing levels at Orion
could mean higher pension costs for Ford and a scramble to
hire new workers at Wixom.
   "GM comes out a winner, because the union is taking away
Ford's advantage," says Wendy Needham, an analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The big loser in all this could be Chrysler. It's likely
that the union won't kick bargaining into high gear with the
struggling No. 3 auto maker until after it settles with GM
and Ford.
   Currently, Chrysler is asking for concessions from the
UAW, and says it needs to cut operating expenses by $2.5
billion annually in the face of sharply lower sales and
market share. A rich contract at GM and Ford could undercut
those plans.
   "I don't think Ford or GM care whether Chrysler continues
in competition with them," asserts Anthony P. St. John,
Chrysler's vice president for employee relations. "They have
enough competition."
   A decade ago, when Chrysler almost went bankrupt, the UAW
agreed to concessions as part of a $4 billion bailout of the
ailing auto maker. But the UAW isn't in the mood for
concessions these days. Workers at Chrysler's engine plant in
Kenosha, Wis., say they will not approve any settlement
unless it follows the pattern of what GM and Ford workers
get. To make their views clear, many of them have taken to
wearing buttons that say, "Pattern or picket."
