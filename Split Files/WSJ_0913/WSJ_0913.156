   A state judge in New York temporarily barred St. Martin's
Press from selling a book about the Israeli intelligence
service, the Mossad.
   State Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Dontzin signed the
order early yesterday morning after lawyers for the Israeli
government argued that publication of the book would endanger
lives and disclose confidential in formation.

   Justice Dontzin ordered the New York publishing house to
recall approximately 18,000 copies of the book that have
already been shipped. And St. Martin's said an additional
30,000 orders are being withheld from distribution as a
result of the judge's order.
   The book, "By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of
a Mossad Officer," was written by Victor Ostrovsky. Mr.
Ostrovsky, who now lives in Canada, claims he spent two years
as a Mossad agent. He wrote the book in collaboration with
Claire Hoy, a Canadian journalist.
   A Canadian court last week barred the book's Canadian
publisher, Stoddart Publishing Co. of Toronto, from
continuing production or releasing the book before Sept. 17,
when a hearing is expected to be held, a spokeswoman for
Stoddart said.
   Roy Gainsburg, president of St. Martin's, said he believed
this was the first time that a foreign government had
successfully enjoined publication of a book in the U.S.
   Jonathan J. Lerner, a lawyer representing the Israeli
government, said the book's author had violated a
confidentiality agreement not to divulge any secrets. "If a
CIA agent were seeking to publish vital U.S. secrets in
Israel, wouldn't we expect the Israeli courts to protect
those secrets?" said Mr. Lerner, a lawyer with the New York
firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.
   First Amendment lawyers said courts won't restrain the
publication of a book except in extraordinary situations.
These experts said the Israeli government's fears that the
book might endanger lives may have persuaded the judge to
issue the order.
   But P. Cameron DeVore, a First Amendment lawyer with the
Seattle firm Davis Wright Tremaine, said the U.S. Supreme
Court has held that such orders are unconstitutional unless
an immediate and direct threat to U.S. security -- not that
of a foreign government -- exists.
   "Even if this book is published, as I think it will be,
it's a setback that a restraint order was entered at all,"
said Floyd Abrams of the New York firm Cahill, Gordon &amp;
Reindel, a First Amendment expert.
   Israeli media reports indicated the book contains
allegations that the Mossad knew in advance about the
terrorist attack that killed 240 U.S. Marines in Beirut in
1983 and also includes information about Mossad espionage
activity inside the U.S.
   Justice Dontzin has scheduled a hearing for tomorrow to
review evidence to determine whether the ban should be
continued. But the appellate court is expected to consider
today St. Martin's request that the order be overturned
immediately.

   CAMERAS IN FEDERAL COURTS are approved as a limited
experiment.
   The Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the
federal courts, voted to allow a three-year experiment
allowing the use of cameras and broadcasting equipment in
civil trials in two federal appeals courts and six federal
district courts. The broadcasting experiment won't involve
criminal trials because rules of procedure prohibit it.
   The experiment, which begins in July 1991, will mark the
first time television or still cameras or radio broadcasting
equipment have been allowed in the federal courts in at least
50 years. In the past decade, most state court systems have
experimented with allowing cameras in courtrooms, and 44
states now allow broadcast of some trials.
   But the trend in the states was never matched in the
federal courts, due to the skepticism of many judges and the
adamant opposition of Chief Justice Warren Burger, who
retired in 1986. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, although
firmly opposed to televising Supreme Court sessions,
appointed a committee in 1988 to study the use of cameras in
other federal courts.
   Last month, the committee recommended the three-year
experiment, and yesterday the 27-judge Judicial Conference
gave its permission. A conference spokesman said the approval
was on a voice vote, but that a few judges expressed
objections at the closed-door session.
   Once the participating courts are chosen, the experiment
will be conducted under restrictions set by the Judicial
Conference. News media wishing to televise a trial must
notify the judge in advance; the request may be refused at
the judge's discretion.
   The experiment will be evaluated by the Federal Judicial
Center, the judiciary's research arm, after it is concluded
in June 1994. Any decision to open the federal courts further
for broadcasting will depend on the evaluation.
   The experiment doesn't include the Supreme Court, which
isn't covered by the Judicial Conference's action. It is up
to the nine justices to decide whether to allow television
coverage, and they repeatedly have rejected requests by
lopsided votes.

   FTC INVESTIGATES recruiting by law firms.
   The Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether major
law firms are violating antitrust laws by cooperating with
each other in their recruiting and hiring of law students.
   The investigation, believed to be the first of its kind,
focuses on agreements among big law firms to limit expenses
related to recruiting, such as airline tickets, hotel
accommodations and restaurant meals, according to people
familiar with the inquiry.
   The FTC has targeted law firms based in Cleveland. It
isn't known how many firms are under scrutiny or whether
firms from other cities also are involved.
   In the annual competition for top graduating law students,
large firms routinely coordinate and share expenses
associated with interviewing and wooing potential associates.
The FTC apparently believes that such coordination may
include illegal collusion to limit costs and restrain
competition for sought-after recruits.
   Without "confirming or denying" any specific
investigation, FTC official Michael McNeely said that "if the
firms agree on the level of wining and dining people," they
may be violating federal antitrust laws.
   Employees with three Cleveland firms -- Arter &amp; Hadden,
Baker &amp; Hostetler and Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey -- confirmed
that they were under investigation. Another firm under
scrutiny is Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, according to people
familiar with the FTC action. The FTC's investigation was
first reported this week by Legal Times, a Washington trade
paper.
   If the commission determines that antitrust laws have been
violated, it could seek to impose fines on the law firms and
request a court order barring anti-competitive recruiting
practices.
   Arter &amp; Hadden's managing partner, Robert Glaser, called
the investigation "ludicrous" and denied any wrongdoing by
his firm or the others under scrutiny.
   Mr. Glaser acknowledged that law firms coordinate student
interview trips, and that this cooperation saves costs for
the firms. But he insisted that coordination takes place
primarily for students' benefit and only when requested by
students. "We aren't limiting our recruiting," he said. "We
aren't colluding on who we invite. We hire independently."
   Employees with Baker &amp; Hostetler and Squire Sanders
confirmed that the firms are being investigated but declined
to elaborate. An employee with Jones Day said the firm's
managing partner, Richard Pogue, wasn't available to comment.

   INVESTORS SUING DREXEL seek relief from court stay.
   The judge overseeing Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s
bankruptcy case has been asked to allow six lawsuits to go
forward accusing Drexel, its former junk-bond chief Michael
Milken and others of a massive conspiracy to rig the
junk-bond market.
   The federal and state civil lawsuits are class actions
filed by investors who allege an intertwined scheme of
securities-law violations, racketeering and other wrongdoing.
In the alleged scheme, sometimes referred to as a daisy
chain, Mr. Milken, Drexel and several corporate raiders are
accused of creating a false market for the securities through
sham transactions and price manipulation.
   Some of the suits also blame the alleged scheme for
exacerbating the crisis in the savings and loan industry.
Federal regulators and Congress have begun their own
investigations into possible criminal activity in the alleged
scheme.
   Although trial dates have already been set for some of the
lawsuits, the cases can't go forward because of an automatic
stay that goes into effect when a company files for
bankruptcy-law protection. Drexel filed under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 13.
   "The public interest demands that there be a full public
airing and fair prosecution of all civil claims relating to
Drexel's notorious operations, and that the bankruptcy laws
not be used as an offensive weapon to shield the responsible
wrongdoers," the plaintiffs said in a motion filed in federal
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The motion was filed by
Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie &amp; Lerach, which represents
the securities class-action group.
   The motion argues that it will be impossible for Drexel to
come up with a feasible bankruptcy reorganization plan
without getting a better handle on the damages it will face
from the litigation. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard
Buschman III set a hearing for Oct. 2 on the request.
   A spokesman for Drexel said the company will file its
response to the motion later this month. He said, "The reason
for a stay in bankruptcy proceedings is, among other things,
to allow the debtor to develop a comprehensive plan in an
organized way without the need to attend to a multitude of
separate claims."
   Under the plaintiffs' proposal, the court would allow the
cases to continue until damages, if any, are determined, but
it wouldn't allow the plaintiffs to try to collect the money.

   FORMER HUGHES AIRCRAFT employee wins whistle-blower suit.
   A state Superior Court jury in Los Angeles awarded $1.95
million to a former Hughes Aircraft Co. employee who
contended he was fired after accusing the company of
overcharging the government on defense contracts.
   After five days of deliberations, the jury upheld claims
made by Bobby Coffey, 55 years old, who had worked at Hughes
for more than two decades. As a program-cost analyst at
Hughes's missile division, Mr. Coffey pointed out allegedly
fraudulent practices in which the company overcharged the
government for labor and materials. Melanie Lomax, Mr.
Coffey's attorney, alleged yesterday that the overcharging
amounted to "hundreds of thousands, if not millions" of
dollars.
   Mr. Coffey also claimed age discrimination, but the jury
didn't uphold that particular claim, said Hughes, a unit of
General Motors Corp.
   The company, which is planning to appeal, has denied that
it ever overcharged the government and maintains that Mr.
Coffey was dismissed because he had falsified a time card.
"We feel the verdict was not consistent with the evidence
that was presented," said a spokesman for Hughes.

   FORMER TAKEOVER LAWYER at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp;
Flom pleaded guilty to three insider-trading counts. Steven
Glauberman, a former Skadden Arps associate, pleaded guilty
to two counts of disclosing confidential information that he
learned at the firm and one count of trading on such
information. Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in federal court
in Manhattan set sentencing for Dec. 21. Mr. Glauberman is
cooperating with prosecutors in the case, in which three
other defendants have been named.
