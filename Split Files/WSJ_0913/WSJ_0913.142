   DALLAS -- A federal bankruptcy judge here refused to allow
Southmark Corp. to pay a $960,000 bonus to Arthur G. Weiss,
who marshalled the real estate and financial services company
through its recent reorganization.
   The bonus would have supplemented the $480,000 annual
salary and $480,000 in severance benefits to be received by
Mr. Weiss, who stepped down as Southmark's chairman in
mid-August as part of the court-approved reorganization plan
for Southmark.

   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stephen Felsenthal said yesterday
that he couldn't "in good conscience" approve the bonus
payment to Mr. Weiss. "The court is very skeptical about
compensation packages from companies that are able to pay
only a fraction of their debts," the judge said. Southmark's
reorganization plan provides for creditors to receive just
$300 million in cash and securities to satisfy claims
totaling $2 billion.
   Southmark directors approved Mr. Weiss's bonus in January,
about a year after he had taken the helm following the
directors' ouster of Gene E. Phillips as chairman and William
S. Friedman as vice chairman. Southmark filed in July 1989
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.
   Mr. Weiss, reached at his home in Atlanta, said he was
disappointed by the judge's decision but could understand the
reasoning behind it. "I've been compensated fairly in this,"
he said, adding that any appeal would be carefully
considered. "I think I did go out with honor, and to have a
fight now wouldn't do anybody any good," he said.
   Separately, Judge Felsenthal ruled that Southmark has
fulfilled the requirements of its reorganization plan
relating to stock and cash payments to creditors and the
transfer of $100 million in assets to the company's thrift
unit, San Jacinto Savings Association of Houston. The judge's
order effectively seals the plan from any further changes,
though parts of it have been appealed by Messrs. Phillips and
Friedman.
