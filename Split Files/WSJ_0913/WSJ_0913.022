   Watching Meryl Streep impersonate Carrie Fisher's
fictionalized version of herself as a drugged-out Beverly
Hills brat is a bit like watching a grand diva put all she's
got into "My Boy Lollipop." You don't know which is made to
seem more ridiculous: the performer, for investing far too
much into far too little, or the thing being performed.
   On the other hand, without the heavyweight team assembled
to put "Postcards From the Edge" onto the screen, there would
be nothing at all to anchor this piece of fluff. Ms. Fisher's
glib autobiographical novel sold well, presumably because it
satisfied the public's urge to discover, again and again,
that the rich and famous are miserable, too. Her wisecracking
approach offered the reassurance that she wasn't taking the
misery overseriously so it was okay to take pleasure in
reading about it.

   The book and the movie tell the story of Suzanne, a young
actress who seems very much like Ms. Fisher when she was a
young actress trying to recover from her problems: drugs and
mother. Suzanne's famous mother (Ms. Fisher's is Debbie
Reynolds) constantly upstages her daughter, and she drinks
too much.
   At best this may have worked as an overwrought soap opera,
sort of "A Turning Point" for addicts. After all, director
Mike Nichols did bring in Shirley MacLaine to play the
mother, creating great opportunities for some satisfying
lip-quivering. Or maybe it would have made a good musical;
Ms. Streep sings a couple of songs and proves once again (as
she did in "Ironweed") that she can deliver a song with
spirit and style.
   Instead Mr. Nichols decided to preserve the jokiness of
the original material, even while shifting the emphasis to
the mother-daughter conflict. There may have been a way to do
this and end up with a clever movie, but Mr. Nichols seems to
have had an even cleverer idea: He decided to use this movie
as a way to pay back social obligations.
   "Mike Nichols's great gift is that people want to work
with him, so once he and Meryl were on board it was like
giving a party -- let's say a party in honor of Meryl and
Mike. Who's not going to come? Well, everybody came," Ms.
Fisher has said.
   And so the cast is packed with first-rate actors in
third-rate parts. Still, it's good they're all there, because
figuring out who came to the party for Meryl and Mike becomes
the only interesting way to pass the time once one has
admired how prettily Michael Ballhaus has photographed Ms.
Streep.
   But soon her prettiness becomes bothersome as well. Why
does she look so pretty even when she's supposed to be
portraying a "coked up little actress?" There's not a trace
of that nasty calling card of the cokehead, those facial
lines that even the best makeup can't disguse. Even in the
few minutes the film devotes to Suzanne's druggy days Ms.
Streep looks positively radiant. She doesn't, however, look
like a woman so young that a drug rehabilitation counselor
would demand that she live with her mother on release. Yet
that's the premise of the movie.
   Most of the action takes place on the movie sets where
Suzanne goes to work in various costumes and suffers the
humiliation of being told she eats too much and that she must
take a drug test to work. She giggles, cringes and obeys
because, as everyone involved with this empty enterprise
earnestly wants us to believe: She's okay, she's okay.

   The young director Phil Joanou seems to understand
everything there is to know about gangster films and nothing
about the gangster soul. His "State of Grace," a picture
about Irish mobsters, has the uncertain air of a tourist in
New York reciting carefully memorized directions to a cab
driver. The out-of-towner may say all the right things, but
he doesn't have a clue and he isn't fooling anyone.
   The picture revolves around the Flannery family, who are
meant to be the Hell's Kitchen version of the Corleone
family. There is Kathleen, the estranged sister (Robin
Wright); Frankie, the cool businesslike brother who leads the
gang (Ed Harris); and Jackie (Gary Oldman), the violently
psychotic brother who moans about the disappearance of the
old neighborhood and periodically explodes with rage. Sean
Penn plays the old pal who reappears on the scene after a
long absence.
   The script, written by the late Dennis McIntyre and
doctored by David Rabe, has an original twist in an otherwise
unexceptional stew of modern-day gangsterisms. The Flannery
boys aren't big-time operators nor are they street punks. So
who are they? The picture isn't any clearer about them than
it is about the world they move in. There's some exposition
about moving uptown, and the yuppification of Hell's Kitchen,
but there's very little sense of a specific time and place.
   While Mr. Joanou understands where to put his camera, he
doesn't always know when to, and the story is frequently
muddled. He's put together a group of very good actors who
don't seem to know who they are and how they should behave.
   Every shot in the movie seems to have been lifted from
some other film. You can almost hear the director saying,
"Let's do the `Mean Streets' shot over here, `The Godfather
II' shot over there." It's as if the idea to make the
characters Irish came as an afterthought, a way to
differentiate these gangsters from the usual Italians. Yet
there is nothing in the rhythm of the characters' speech or
manner that identifies them as Irish, though Mr. Joanou does
stage the final scene in conjunction with the St. Patrick's
Day parade.

   VIDEO TIP: Mike Nichols used to make films that were
thought-provoking as well as moving as well as entertaining.
Remember "The Graduate," "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
"Carnal Knowledge," "Catch-22"?
