   RENO, Nev. -- Athena Gold Corp. and its U.S. subsidiary,
Athena Gold Inc., said they signed a joint venture accord
with Placer Dome U.S. to develop Athena's 19-square-mile
Talapoosa property.
   Athena said terms provide for Placer Dome U.S., a unit of
Placer Dome Inc., based in Vancouver, to be the operator and
to receive a 51% interest in the overall Talapoosa property.
In return, Placer Dome will spend about $25.5 million to fund
exploration, engineering, and project capital, along with
making certain advances and other payments to Athena Gold
Inc.
