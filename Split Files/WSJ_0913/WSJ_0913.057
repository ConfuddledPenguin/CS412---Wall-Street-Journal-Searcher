   Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, a French auto maker,
said AB Volvo of Sweden joined in its bid for a stake in the
Czechoslovak auto maker Skoda. Last February, Renault and
Volvo signed a cross-share-holding pact, which is pending.
   Recent speculation in business circles placed French
state-owned Renault ahead of rival bidders Volkswagen AG of
West Germany and General Motors Corp. of Detroit in the
contest for a large, possibly controlling interest in
state-run Skoda, which plans to become a joint stock company
by the end of October. A spokesman for Renault said it
expects a decision from the Czechoslovak government by
October.

   Skoda produces nearly 200,000 vehicles a year and earns
$100 million annually in hard currency -- the third-largest
amount among all Czechoslovak companies.
   Renault also said it agreed to sell a 35% stake, about
210,000 shares, in its Societe de Mecanique d'Irigny S.A.
steering assembly unit to Koyo Seiko of Japan for about 100
million francs ($18.8 million) and is offering Koyo an option
to become majority holder. Koyo, 18%-owned by Toyota Motor
Corp. of Japan, makes steering systems and ball bearings.
