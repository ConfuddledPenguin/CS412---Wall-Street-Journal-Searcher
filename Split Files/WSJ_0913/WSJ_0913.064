   Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the last major American maker of
heavy robots, is quitting the business.
   The machine tool maker said it signed a letter of intent
to sell its robot business to ABB Robotics Inc., a unit of
Asea Brown Boveri AG, which is based in Zurich, Switzerland.
Milacron, of Cincinnati, said terms were being negotiated.

   A company spokesman said the business represented less
than 10% of Milacron's total revenue of $850.6 million in
1989, and that the sale wouldn't have any material effect on
1990 earnings.
   Milacron's plan is to concentrate in three areas related
to basic manufacturing -- machine tools, plastics machinery
and consumable industrial products, such as grinding wheels
and fluids used in metal-cutting. The company, which has been
losing money in its robot business, recently sold units that
produced industrial lasers and wafers for semiconductors, for
instance.
   Milacron's withdrawal leaves most of the U.S. robot market
in the hands of foreign producers. The Japanese have been
especially aggressive competitors because their costs for
electronic components have been lower and they have had a
ready market in Japan; Manufacturers there have adopted
robotics much faster than U.S. companies.
   The largest robot supplier to the U.S. market is GMFanuc
Robotics Corp., Auburn Hills, Mich., a joint venture between
General Motors and Fanuc Ltd., a major Japanese producer of
robots and electronic controls. However, many of the robots
GMFanuc markets and installs are made by Fanuc in Japan.
   Asea Brown already is a factor in the U.S. robot business,
with facilities in New Berlin, Wis., and Rochester Hill,
Mich., that build robotic systems around robots produced in
Sweden. Asea plans to continue Milacron's business,
fulfilling current contracts and providing all customer
services including training and parts replacement, Milacron
said. Asea also intends to retain a substantial number of
Milacron employees, Milacron said.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Milacron yesterday fell 12.5 cents to $12.625.
   Milacron jumped into robots in 1977, a time when it
appeared that robots would replace humans in many repetitive
manufacturing jobs, ranging from loading and unloading
machine tools to final assembly and painting of the product.
   However, robot applications developed much more slowly
than Milacron expected; there usually was a cheaper way to
get the job done. The Robot Industry Association, Ann Arbor,
Mich., says U.S. robot shipments this year, including robots
manufactured abroad, may exceed $500 million, but that is
only a fraction of the market foreseen a decade ago.
   In recent years, Milacron chopped the size of its robot
operations, and concentrated production in a modern plant at
Greenwood, S.C. The primary product was spot welding
equipment, used mainly by the auto industry.
   Meanwhile, Japanese producers gradually took over much of
the U.S. market by selling lower-cost robots. Often they were
smaller and less versatile than Milacron's big, bright yellow
robots, but they did their particular job at a lower cost.
   Milacron officials complain that some Japanese competitors
"look at a robot as a shipping container for six electric
motors, six drives and a bunch of electronic controls," all
of which the Japanese could make more cheaply than U.S.
companies. In addition, Japanese manufacturers adopted
robotics more quickly than did most U.S. manufacturers, which
gave Japanese robot companies a bigger domestic sales base
and the efficiency gained from high volume production.
   Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said he
was "sad but not surprised," by Milacron's move. "They went
into robotics with tremendous hopes but weren't able to earn
satisfactory profits." Mr. Lustgarten noted that in the past
decade "half the Fortune 50 companies were fooling with
robots, companies from Westinghouse Electric Corp. to General
Electric Co. and United Technologies Inc." But the gross
margins weren't sufficient to support the technology
investments needed, he said.
   Some small U.S. players remain. Graco Robotics, a unit of
Graco Inc., based in Golden Valley, Minn., for example, makes
robots for spray painting. There are dozens of other small
U.S. producers that make robots for specialized applications.
