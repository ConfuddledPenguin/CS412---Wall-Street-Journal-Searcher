   Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, said it completed
the sale of its soft-drink beverage business to a group led
by management of the unit. Westinghouse also purchased a 15%
interest in the new venture. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Westinghouse, a diversified company with interests in
broadcasting, financial services, community development and
electrical parts distribution, signaled last year that the
beverage group was on the block, as it had been hurt by
pricing competition in the soft-drink industry.
