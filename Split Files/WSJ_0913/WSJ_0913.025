   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks staged a feeble rally
on a late-afternoon Egyptian report of a growing movement in
Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.83 to 380.32, a 0.2%
gain, after showing a slight loss most of the day. Volume
remained light at 98.5 million shares, down from 100.1
million shares Tuesday. Advancing stocks narrowly outpaced
decliners, 890 to 809.

   "The market's dull, choppy, and everybody's just watching
the news," said Jim O'Neill, co-manager of OTC trading for
Robinson-Humphrey Co. Mr. O'Neill agreed with other traders
that some investors took heart from an Egyptian news report
of growing Iraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein.
   Large, institutional investors continue to be selective,
while small investors are largely inactive, said James
Tarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco. "It's extremely, extremely slow," he added.
   Some familiar OTC leaders regained favor as Nike sprinted
2 to 73 and Amgen rose 1 7/8 to 48. Both companies were
scheduled to appear yesterday at the final day of a
Montgomery Securities conference in San Francisco.
   Shortly before the market closed, Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
biotechnology analyst Jeffrey Casdin repeated a "buy" opinion
on Amgen, a biotechnology company based in Thousand Oaks,
Calif. Mr. Casdin said in an interview he has a "high degree
of confidence" that a Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel will convene Dec. 13 and 14 to review Amgen's G-CSF
product, which stimulates the production of white blood cells
to fight infection.
   If the panel recommends approval of the product, then it
could be marketed next year, he said. Mr. Casdin also said he
thinks Amgen's recent investment in a company that develops
products to treat neurological disorders will help keep the
stock trading at the current above-market multiple of its
earnings.
   There were a few bright spots in the technology sector.
Bullish analysts comments boosted Microsoft 1 7/8 to 57 3/8,
while AST Research added 1 to 19 after a favorable meeting
with analysts in New York.
   Lotus rebounded 1/2 to 17, after falling 1 1/2 Tuesday
when company officials said that growth will slow somewhat.
Intel also rose 3/4 to 32 3/4 and was the day's most active
stock.
   Elsewhere in the technology group, Conner Peripherals fell
1/4 to 22 1/4; Sun Microsytems eased 3/8 to 28 3/8; Seagate
Technology declined 1/4 to 8 1/2; Oracle Systems slipped 1/4
to 8 1/4; and Apple Computer was unchanged at 34. The Nasdaq
Industrial Index, which includes many large technology
shares, drifted most of the day but rallied at the close to
gain 1.66 to 406.45.
   Microsoft was featured by Goldman Sachs analyst Rick
Sherlund and Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst David
Readerman, both of whom repeated their "buy" opinions on the
Redmond, Wash., software maker. Mr. Sherlund said he expects
that sales of Microsoft's highly successful Windows 3.0
software this quarter could rapidly accelerate from the June
quarter, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
   The analyst also raised his earnings estimate for
Microsoft's first quarter ending Sept. 30 to a range of 70
cents to 75 cents a share from his previous estimate of 63
cents. A year earlier Microsoft had profit of 43 cents a
share.
   Microsoft's new local area network product, called LAN
Manager, and network database product, SQL Server, are
critical to Shearson Lehman Brothers' estimated 30% to 35%
near-term growth rate for the company, Mr. Readerman told
DJPIR. LAN Manager will help Microsoft capture a share of the
approximately $1 billion personal computer networking market,
he said, adding that initial signs indicate the company is
having some success in capturing some market share from
Novell.
   Autodesk eased 1/2 to 46 1/2 after tumbling as low as 44
1/2. Traders attributed the fall to the resignation last week
of the company's vice president of software development,
Ronald McElhaney, and rumors that his departure could delay
the introduction of Release 11.2, the company's new
computer-aided design and drafting software product, DJPIR
reported. However, Autodesk's chief financial officer,
Carolyn V. Aver, said Mr. McElhaney's departure won't have
any impact on the product's release, which is expected in
October.
   TW Holdings was unchanged at 4 1/16 after slipping to 4
earlier in the day. The Spartanburg, S.C., provider of food,
vending and medical services said it is making two
prepayments totaling $70 million on senior debt out of
current cash flow. Last month, TW Holdings led OTC stocks
with the largest increase in short interest; the short
position in the company rose more than one million shares, to
nearly 2.2 million. Short-sellers borrow stock and sell it,
hoping to profit by returning cheaper shares to the lender.
Short interest is the total amount of shares sold short at a
given time.
   Among the day's gainers, AEL Industries Class A shares
jumped 7/8 to 5 3/4. Tuesday afternoon, the Lansdale, Pa.,
defense electronics concern reported that operating profit
for the second quarter ended Aug. 31 was 15 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.28 a share after an
$8 million special provision.
   Data Switch added 1/2 to 3 7/8. The Shelton, Conn., maker
of switching products told investors in a news release that
International Business Machines's introduction last week of
switching components expands Data Switch's market
opportunities.
   Alliant Computer Systems gained 1/4 to 2 3/4. Tuesday, the
Littleton, Mass., computer maker told investors in a news
release that it developed a new way for users in a Digital
VAX local area network to access an Alliant supercomputer.
   United Artists Entertainment Class A shares jumped 1 1/8
to 13. Officials with the Denver operator of cable television
stations and theaters met with with analysts Tuesday morning
and discussed a recent refinancng and its cable ventures in
the United Kingdom, DJPIR said.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst John Reidy told
DJPIR the refinancing now enables United Artists to borrow up
to $500 million with little difficulty. Mr. Reidy, who rates
the stock a "buy," said there was also enthusiasm at the
meeting for the company's British cable ventures and the
prospects for its cash-flow growth.
   First Executive Series F preferred shares tumbled 1 5/8 to
3 3/4. Last month, the troubled Los Angeles insurer said it
was considering halting dividend payments on all of its
preferred stock.
