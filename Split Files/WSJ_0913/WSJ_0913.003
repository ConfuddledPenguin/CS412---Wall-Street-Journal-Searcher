   TORONTO -- Aur Resources Inc. said it agreed to settle a
legal dispute over the ownership of a large copper and zinc
deposit it discovered in northern Quebec.
   The agreement, between Aur, Louvem Mines Inc. and Louvem's
parent, Ste. Genevieve Resources Ltd., gives Aur a 55%
working interest in the Louvicourt deposit. Louvem will hold
45% of the property and will get a payment from Aur of one
million Canadian dollars (U.S.$861,300).

   Aur, based in Toronto, will retain the key role of
operator of any mine developed at the deposit, which has been
hailed as one of Canada's biggest base-metal discoveries in
recent years. Louvem and Ste. Genevieve are based in
Montreal.
   The proposed settlement came after a previous agreement
was blocked last month by Noranda Minerals Inc., a unit of
Noranda Inc. that owns 22% of Louvem's shares. Aur said
Noranda, a resources concern based in Toronto, approved the
latest pact, which provides for Noranda to manage Louvem's
interest in the deposit.
   The legal dispute between Aur and Louvem dates back to
April 1989, when Aur filed a suit against Louvem and Ste.
Genevieve, claiming Louvem forfeited a 50% stake in the
Louvicourt property because it failed to make a payment on
exploration expenses. Louvem in turn alleged that Aur
withheld data about the property, and claimed 100% ownership.
Each company denied the other's charges.
   Under the settlement proposal, Noranda has the right of
first refusal to purchase between 50% and 60% of Aur's share
of mine output in the first eight years of production. Louvem
also has agreed to sell its share of metal output from the
property over the life of the mine to Noranda, which owns a
nearby smelting facility.
   The settlement, which is subject to regulatory approval
and other conditions, is expected to be finalized by Sept.
24.
