   Shortly before the Gulf crisis began dominating the
headlines, President Bush announced that he was interested in
establishing a free-trade zone covering the entire Western
Hemisphere: from northern Canada to the southern tip of South
America. His announcement followed on the heels of the first
stage of talks leading to a Mexican-U.S.-Canadian free-trade
agreement, which are moving much quicker than anyone imagined
when they were first announced. All this represents a
significant shift in Latin American thinking concerning
economic development.
   For decades, Latin American leaders were under the false
impression that the best way to develop their economies was
to protect local industry from foreign competition. This led
to statist capitalism, which benefited a few well-placed
industrialists but left the vast majority of citizens cut off
from the rest of the world. The industrialists got lazy
because they didn't have to compete with anyone -- including
their fellow countrymen -- and the products they manufactured
became inferior and over-priced. Uncompetitive islands of
economic and political instability resulted.

   It's a little early to say "all that has changed." But
Latin leaders are now generally accepting the notion that if
they integrate their economies with the rest of the world --
this hemisphere in particular -- they stand a much better
chance of growing and of benefiting from foreign ideas and
capital. Recently Wall Street Journal editors asked five
Latin American economic ministers their views on a
hemispheric trade zone. Their responses:

   Rudolf Hommes
   Finance Minister:
   President Bush's idea of creating a Western Hemisphere
free-trade zone is of great importance. It is the first
concrete proposal of the U.S. to promote the integration of
the Americas based on trade, an important element of social
and political cohesion.
   However, in analyzing this initiative it is necessary to
point out that since it is not entirely based on economic
grounds -- but is associated with the geopolitical relations
of power -- it can introduce new economic inefficiencies. For
example, the economic integration with Latin American and
Caribbean countries could lead to a specialization of the
productive basis of those countries that is determined by the
competitive advantages that may exist with relation to the
U.S. and Canadian economies, but could not necessarily exist
with respect to the economies of the rest of the world.
   The idea, in principle, is feasible, provided that the
U.S. and its prospective Southern partners tame their
protectionist instincts in order to make it work. This would
seem plausible inasmuch as the international experience shows
that human well-being benefits from the effective practice of
free trade.
   In this sense, it is clear that Latin American leaders and
technocrats are finally aware that protectionism is out moded
and ruinous: The degree of protection given to local
production is a measure of the inefficiency that a community
is willing to tolerate in detriment to its own well-being,
and the economic development of the past 50 years in the
Latin American countries has been delayed by a social
ideology that has made them accept an outrageous level of
inefficiency for the sake of a vague but vehement
nationalism.
   As explained until now, the outline of the Bush initiative
seems to miss one element that would enhance these positive
expectations. While it would seek the free market of goods,
services, capital and technology within the free-trade area
in the medium term, it avoids referring to the conditions
that would permit what is essential for the success of an
integrated market: the free movement of people.
   Another important aspect of President Bush's proposal is
the flexibility given to each country to choose between
bilateral integration mechanisms and those that strengthen
sub-regional blocks. The same could be said with respect to
the freedom conferred to each country to choose their own
time frame for developing an agreement. However, free access
to the U.S. and Canadian markets is the common incentive that
would move Latin American countries in either direction. This
suggests that the bilateral option would be the most popular
choice.
   A key to the success of the integration process is the
equal treatment of and the non-discrimination among
participants, independent of the way in which they choose to
join. It may be that the implementation of the initiative
will not occur in the context of GATT-like negotiations but
that a series of general principles will be clearly defined
and will be compulsory for all participant members.
Nevertheless, it is hoped that the principles established by
the U.S. government will not be the same it is trying to
advance in the Uruguay Round because our expectation is that
this initiative would be more advantageous for Latin American
trade.
   Of course, this initiative will not comprehensively absorb
all bilateral issues. Colombia, for example, will be looking
beyond it or even beyond the Andean Initiative to advance its
own bilateral agenda with the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   MEXICO
                                                                                                       

   Jaime Serra-Puche
   Minister of Trade and Industry:
   President Bush's initiative concerning a hemispheric
free-trade zone has caught the imagination of Latin America.
The initiative will provide the means to complement
adequately economies in order to facilitate a new era of
trade and investment relations -- as well as enhancing
cooperation on scientific and technological issues. Free
trade is crucial in today's increasingly interdependent
world. The global economy requires active trade and
investment flows so domestic economies can prosper and grow.
Of course, trade agreements between developed and developing
nations need to recognize their differences so that every
participant benefits fully from liberalized trade regimes.
   Mexico's own structural change is based on a simple
premise: Mexico has to insert itself in the global economy.
Mexico's international competitiveness requires adequate
domestic policies and proper external market access, so the
country can benefit fully from international trade and
investment flows.
   On the one hand, domestic policies are consistent with the
outward orientation of the economy: Foreign investment has
been liberalized; non-tariff trade barriers have been
dismantled; intellectual-property-rights legislation is under
review to assure the necessary protection to patents,
licenses, trademarks and industrial secrets; and unnecessary
regulatory obstacles are being and will continue to be
removed. Overall, these policies have substantially enhanced
the competitiveness of Mexico's non-oil exports, which in the
course of the past seven years have increased by a factor of
four, surpassing the export performance of the most dynamic
countries during this period.
   On the other hand, trade negotiations to assure external
market access are a crucial complement to domestic policy.
With each region of the world, we are building stronger
economic relations, based on the principles of free trade.
With the U.S., in particular, we have initiated preparatory
talks that will lead to the negotiation of a free-trade
agreement.
   One important consequence of the free-trade agreement
between Mexico and the U.S. will be the increased
competitiveness of the region vis-a-vis the rest of the
world. In sum, a free-trade agreement will complement
Mexico's internationalization strategy and it will
substantially increase bilateral trade and investment flows.
The benefits of such a pact will undoubtedly accrue to both
countries, in terms of employment, efficiency and
international competitiveness.
                                                                                                       

   BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   Zelia Cardosa de Mello
   Finance Minister:
   The Brazilian government has been carrying out a
tremendous effort to reform the structure of its economy. The
new foreign trade and industrial policies, which encompass
the gradual elimination of tariffs and trade barriers in
general, have facilitated a greater integration of the
Brazilian economy with the world economy.
   In this context, international cooperation is more than
welcomed. We feel that to the extent that this cooperation is
renewed and expanded, Brazil will be able to react to it more
swiftly and more effectively.
   The guidelines of the new U.S. free-trade initiative are a
positive sign to Latin America as whole. They represent a new
approach of the U.S. government toward the region. We hope to
be able to explore in more detail the proposals made and to
examine ways and means to apply them for mutual benefit. They
touch three points of fundamental importance: the debt
question, the new investments in the region and the building
up of an open trade market. By dealing with those three
essential matters they follow a path that we consider to be
potentially fruitful.
   The feasibility of the proposals depends, at this stage,
on the mechanisms of dialogue we may establish and, of
course, on the political will to carry them out.
   Brazil has discussed the initiative with the governments
of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and intends to follow up this
discussion. The idea of sharing our views with those of
neighbor countries had the implicit purpose of giving a
response re sulting from deep reflection and coordinated
views. We are sure that the elements are given for the new
steps we all intend to take in our relations with the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   CHILE
                                                                                                       

   Alejandro Foxley
   Minister of Finance:
   There is a growing awareness throughout Latin America that
having an open, trading economy is the surest path for
pulling our economies out of the poverty trap. But an export
drive can only succeed if it can secure export mar kets.
Unfortunately, many countries of the world -- including the
U.S. -- do not always reflect in their actions the free-trade
gospel they preach. There is also the danger of having
"trading blocks" develop, most notably in Europe and the
Pacific. Latin America is not beyond reproach either, having
allowed its regional trading arrangements to languish in the
past 20 years. I welcome President Bush's proposal as a
much-needed antidote to this dangerous world-wide tendency.
It is now up to all countries in the hemisphere to move
swiftly and begin taking concrete steps.
   A free-trade agreement in the Americas would ultimately
benefit every country in the hemisphere, rich or poor. For
Latin America, greater openness would mean greater foreign
competition. But it would also provide much-needed overseas
customers. I believe many of us are ready to take up this
challenge. At the same time, growing Latin American exports
to the U.S. and Canada would have as a counterpart a more
stable and prosperous set of economies south of the Rio
Grande, among which Northern firms could also find promising
trade and investment partners. There would be some temporary
adjustment costs, but the long-run mutual benefits are clear.
The proposal therefore seems feasible. What is now needed is
the political will to move forward.
   At this point it seems practical to proceed in stages.
Those countries that are ready to open up their markets
should start negotiations, whether bilaterally or in larger
groups. Any concession made to the participants in the early
stages could also be extended to other countries that may
decide to join the process at a later date. Chile already has
low and uniform tariffs and no non-tariff barriers
whatsoever. We believe that is a helpful starting point for
discussions with the U.S. or any other countries of the
region.
                                                                                                       

   ARGENTINA
                                                                                                       

   Antonio Erman Gonzalez
   Minister of Economy:
   We are enthusiastic about President Bush's proposal. We
believe that economic integration is the most important
challenge that the American nations have in this decade, and
the most effective method to compete in the world economy.
Argentina wants to move forward toward this goal by pursuing
the following steps:
   1) Achieve an agreement with the U.S. that will homogenize
the regulatory framework in both countries, allowing free
movement of capital; and
   2) Establish a free-trade zone with Brazil and other
countries in the southern cone by 1994 so as to become a more
meaningful trading partner to integrate with North America.
