   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon, in a legal settlement with an
association representing U.S. defense workers, agreed to
limit its right to purchase defense equipment and services
abroad.
   The settlement, signed in federal district court here,
acknowledges that the Pentagon's reciprocal trade accords
with various allied countries don't constitute a "blanket
waiver" of most "buy-American" rules favoring U.S. defense
suppliers. The exceptions are the Buy American Act of 1933
and a program relating to the logistical needs of overseas
U.S. bases.

   With the defense business now declining nearly everywhere,
U.S. defense workers are demanding stricter observance of the
buy-American laws. The Pentagon buys more than $20 billion
from overseas suppliers annually, the council estimates.
   Jerome Zeifman, counsel for the National Council for
Industrial Defense, said the settlement will make it more
difficult for the Pentagon to go overseas for such items as
research on the "Star Wars" missile-defense program,
supercomputers, certain machine tools, aviation and shipping,
ship repairs, food, and clothing.
   "This is a settlement without prejudice, which means that
we can reinstitute our suit any time we feel that the
Pentagon isn't living up to its agreement," the lawyer said.
   The council filed suit on behalf of the American
Engineering Association, the AFL-CIO, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and other members. Many of
the trade accords affected were signed in the 1980s, when the
U.S. ran large surpluses in defense-related trade and had to
accommodate its allies' demands for more reciprocity.
   The Pentagon, saying the council's suit arose from a
"misunderstanding," characterized the settlement as a
clarification of what has been a legally correct policy all
along. "We've never improperly waived the buy-American
statutes," and the settlement is worded to that effect, said
Robert Gorman, a Pentagon attorney.
