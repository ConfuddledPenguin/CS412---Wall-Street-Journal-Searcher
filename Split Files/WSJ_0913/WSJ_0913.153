   Some economists say the U.S. economy already is in a
recession. If that's true, then the downturn this time may
turn out to be anything but typical.
   Consider the situation among capital-goods manufacturers.
Although business isn't booming at factories that make
tractors, machinery, trucks, machine tools and other heavy
goods, most producers expect to eke out small sales gains in
both 1990 and 1991 even if the overall economy continues to
show little or no growth.

   That's a big change from the past. Once, when the economy
caught cold, makers of capital goods got pneumonia. Now, many
manufacturing executives and economists say this recession,
if it materializes, will differ from the classic downturn in
which manufacturers, particularly capital-goods producers,
are hardest hit.
   Of course, capital-goods makers aren't safe yet. War in
the Middle East could scuttle the entire economy. Moreover,
it's too early to say with certainty that the capital-goods
industry can avoid recession -- generally defined as two
consecutive quarters of economic decline -- because capital
spending typically lags behind the business cycle.
   So far, though, prospects look surprisingly good for a
wide array of U.S. equipment makers. Duriron Co., for
instance, expects record sales and earnings in 1990 and 1991,
says John S. Haddick, chief executive officer of the Dayton,
Ohio, producer of corrosion-resistant pumps and valves.
"World-wide capital spending by the chemical process
industries is going to continue strong through 1991," he
adds, a trend from which Duriron benefits.
   Economists and businessmen offer several explanations for
capital-goods makers' relative prosperity this time around.
Many of these concerns are leaner now, having greatly
improved their product quality and manufacturing efficiency
since the most recent devastating downturn of 1981-82. For
instance, Ingersoll Rand Co., a machinery maker that posted
record second-quarter net income, now generates more sales
than it did a decade ago with one-third fewer employees.
   They're also benefiting greatly from an increased reliance
on exports. Capital-goods makers generally sell a much higher
portion of their output overseas than they once did. And
foreign demand remains robust.
   In 1989, for instance, capital-goods exports jumped 14%
and are expected to rise almost that much this year, says
Adrian T. Dillon, chief economist for Eaton Corp., a
Cleveland-based producer of truck parts and electrical
products. Mr. Dillon expects a 9% to 10% increase next year.
The reasons: Growing economies in Europe and the Far East are
strong markets for U.S. equipment; some Latin American
countries are showing signs of recovery after a decade of
stagnation; and a weak dollar makes U.S. goods more cost
competitive abroad.
   Indeed, for many capital-goods makers, rising exports
mitigate the impact of the U.S. slowdown. U.S. machine tool
factories received $270 million in orders for export in the
first seven months of 1990, up 23% from a year earlier,
according to the machine tool builders' trade association.
   "Exports are continuing to expand at a fast clip and that
will keep the industrial sector humming," asserts Joseph J.
McAlinden, director of securities research at Dillon Read and
a fan of several industrial stocks.
   In addition, American companies, facing worsening global
competition, continue to buy equipment to improve
productivity despite the sluggish U.S. economy. A U.S.
Commerce Department survey made in July and August signaled a
5.1% inflation-adjusted rise in capital spending this year,
less than half the 10.4% increase racked up in 1989, but
still far stronger than the overall economy.
   Mr. McAlinden believes, moreover, that higher oil prices
stemming from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait also will trigger
more capital spending for energy-related investments. Oil
drilling and related storage and transmission equipment is
one obvious example.
   For instance, at CBI Industries Inc., an Oak Brook, Ill.,
supplier of processing equipment to the energy and paper
industries, among others, net income was up 60% in this
year's first half. And if higher oil prices lead to a global
surge in spending for energy-related facilities, as Mr.
McAlinden expects, CBI would be a big beneficiary. For that
reason, he currently recommends CBI stock.
   Of course, not all sectors are faring well in the current
environment. For instance, Caterpillar Inc., the Peoria,
Ill., maker of equipment for the hard-hit construction
industry, is hurting. The company reported a 67% drop in
second-quarter profit partly because the U.S. construction
slowdown chopped sales of earth-moving equipment.
   The story is much different, though, in nearby Moline,
Ill. Says a spokesman for Moline-based Deere &amp; Co., the
nation's largest maker of tractors and farm machinery: "Next
year should be another good year for North American farm
machinery sales," even if the overall economy is flat or
declines slightly.
   Planted acreage is likely to rise, farm incomes are
strong, farmland prices are rising and farmers continue to
reduce their debts. In addition, Deere says, farmers still
are operating some old tractors and combines that would have
been replaced except for the drubbing farmers took in the
mid-1980s.
   Another factor giving rise to optimism is relatively lean
inventories. Typically, a sales slowdown triggers a massive
reduction of business stocks, which requires factory
closings, widespread layoffs and other efforts to slash
output. That's followed by cuts and cancellations of orders
for new equipment.
   However, that cycle could be averted this time because
many companies whacked inventories in the last half of 1989
and the first few months of this year. Manufacturing
inventories at the end of the second quarter were equal to
1.54 months of sales, one of the lowest ratios in the past 40
years, according to the American Production &amp; Inventory
Control Society of Falls Church, Va.
