   CHASE FLOYD IS A TRULY HANDS-ON VOLUNTEER who knows that
philanthropy isn't limited to the well-to-do. Working from
his Chase Hair Salon in Chapel Hill, N.C., the 30-year-old
hair stylist spends an hour or two every week giving free
haircuts to homeless people who otherwise couldn't afford his
$14 to $20 fees. The benefit is more than a coiffure or a
trim, it's renewed self-respect for the recipient.
   "The homeless get the same treatment as my regular
clients," says Mr. Floyd. He began the free haircuts over two
years ago after one of his regular customers told him about
the volunteer work under way at a Chapel Hill shelter run by
the Inter-Faith Council for Social Service. Mr. Floyd, a
Virginian who moved to North Carolina three years ago, wanted
to volunteer, too, but decided his 9 a.m.-to-9 p.m.
small-business hours didn't give him much free time; besides,
he explains, hair styling was the "only thing I really knew
how to do well."
   So he asked Christopher Moran, community services manager
of Inter-Faith, if he could cut shelter guests' hair. Mr.
Moran agreed to the unusual offer, figuring the stylist
"really wanted to do something to contribute" to helping
people without homes get a new start. What began as one free
haircut a week has become three. What's more, Mr. Moran
believes, Mr. Floyd's example of selfless service has spurred
others in the community, including a lawyer and a group of
doctors and nurses, to offer their professional skills.
   As his scissors clip and electric razor hums, Mr. Floyd
converses easily and casually with his homeless clients,
asking about their health and offering suggestions on where
to find jobs and housing. There's nothing patronizing about
these exchanges: "You got it too close back there," one woman
from the shelter says after looking over Mr. Floyd's work in
the mirror. "You said to make it as close as I could in the
back and I did," he responds. "You look nice." Another look,
a smile of agreement, and the woman thanks Mr. Floyd and
leaves.
   One disheveled drifter, dispirited because he couldn't
land so much as a dishwasher's job, early this year was sent
by the shelter to the salon for a haircut. When Mr. Floyd
finished his work, the homeless man could have passed for a
student at the nearby University of North Carolina. Within
two months, the man had a waiter's job and his own small
apartment in a low-cost housing unit.
   Some of the shelter guests want to repay Mr. Floyd and
have at times performed such jobs as raking the salon yard.
Mr. Floyd also pays them for occasional work, such as
painting. Others in the hair business warned Mr. Floyd that
helping the homeless this way might alienate paying
customers, but just the opposite seems to have happened.
"I've had some people come here because they've heard what
I'm doing," he reports.
   Mr. Floyd also makes other contributions to the shelter.
This past Christmas, he threw a party at the salon attended
by 40 homeless people and 15 volunteers. Mr. Floyd personally
donated about $200 of the $1,000 worth of chicken wings,
cookies and soft drinks to the party; local merchants
contributed the balance. He's helping to host another party
for shelter residents this December. He also plans to keep up
the free haircuts. "I will continue to do this as long as I
have a business," Mr. Floyd says.
