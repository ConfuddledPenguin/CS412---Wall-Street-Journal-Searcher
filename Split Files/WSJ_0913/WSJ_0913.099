   It seems that any piece of legislation -- such as the
Textile Quota Bill passed by the Senate with which you
disagree ("The Jesse and Pat Bill," Review &amp; Outlook, July
31) -- is mere crass politics, while those you agree with are
matters of high principle or sound economic reasoning.
   Maybe the Senate was trying to tell the Bush
administration that what is being negotiated in the Uruguay
trade talks may be a disaster for American industry and lead
to a further widening of our unacceptable trade deficit.
Enormous attention has been focused on our domestic deficit,
but the continuing attrition of our national wealth through
the steady $100 billion-plus per-year trade deficit is all
but ignored. The administration has said quite directly that
reduction of the trade deficit is not one of its objectives
in these negotiations. And I believe studies will bear out
the fact that the trade deficit contributes more importantly
to the budget deficit than vice versa.

   You cite how a textile bill that guarantees developing
nations only two-thirds of our apparel market, instead of a
more "competitive" 90% or 95%, is quite unfair to these poor
folks. But you fail to mention that if the full U.S. position
on intellectual property were to be adopted in the Geneva
negotiations, more than $50 billion would be drained from
these very same countries and transferred to U.S.
corporations. This amount is far more than developing
countries would gain through increased exports of textile and
apparel products.
   What is even more striking is your use of a partial, and
inaccurate, economic study to justify the virtues of the
free-market system. While the Federal Trade Commission
exaggerated the cost to consumers of textile quotas and
tariffs, a more complete economic analysis should evaluate
the cost or gain to our total economy, not just to one
segment. Such a comprehensive study was done on the textile
bill the last time Congress considered it, by ICF, an
independent economic consulting firm. That study concluded
that for the U.S. economy as a whole, textile quotas resulted
in a net gain of $1.5 billion.
   In the domestic market, we have not accepted unfettered
free trade for half a century. Such a 19th- and 20th-century
system resulted in mass poverty and robber barons. We prevent
abuse of market power through anti-trust and anti-monopoly
laws. We prevent misdistribution of capital through numerous
securities laws. We create consumer demand by enabling
workers to form unions, receive mandated minimum levels of
compensation and prevent their exploitation by inhuman
working conditions. We preserve other social goods, equal in
validity to economic efficiency, by imposing environmental,
health and safety standards on industrial enterprises. But
none of these restraints are being required in the
international free market; none are being demanded in the
Uruguay Round nor are part of any existing GATT agreements.
   We fail to see why the American public should support
international negotiations where there is a real potential
that our country will come out the loser. Just because
economic theory says things will work out for the best, the
best or reality could very well end up to our national
detriment. It seems the Senate understands this by their more
than two-thirds approval of the textile bill.
