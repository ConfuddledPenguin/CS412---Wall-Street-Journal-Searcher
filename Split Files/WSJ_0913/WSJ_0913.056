   TROY, Mich. -- K mart Corp. plans to ditch its familiar
red and turquoise signs in favor of a new logo.
   Chairman Joseph Antonini acknowledged that changing a
symbol as well known as K mart's is risky because it could
alienate shoppers. But, he said, "We wanted to signify the
changes taking place inside the store. This is what we have
to do."

   The new logo, which will appear in ads as well as signs at
all 2,231 K mart stores by 1995, features a big red "K." The
word "mart" is written in smaller white script inside the K.
It was designed by Anspach, Grossman, Portugal Inc., New
York.
   Retailing and image consultants have contended for some
time that the old logo conveyed the impression that K mart
hadn't changed much since its early discounting days in the
1960s, when it attracted shoppers with low-priced light
bulbs, hangers and other odds and ends. Nowadays, K mart
sells more stylish apparel and home goods. And it just
embarked on a massive $2.3 billion store renovation program
to enlarge its outlets, widen aisles and improve its
displays.
   Mr. Antonini defended the logo change. "Our research
showed you could do anything you wanted with the mart," he
said, "but don't lose that big red K."
