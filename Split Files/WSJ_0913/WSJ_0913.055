   Entrepreneurs are finding there is no end of ways to make
money exploiting the American motorist's yearning to be
pampered.
   The nation that orders power windows as readily as a
Frenchman orders croissants will pay almost anything for
automotive convenience, business owners say. With today's
two-career families, even people who aren't lazy don't have
time to take the car to the garage to have the windows
tinted.

   Businesses that take these problems off the motorist's
shoulders are proliferating. A-Action Mobile Window Tinting
Inc., Orlando, Fla., will tint car windows with plastic film
in the customer's driveway. A Massachusetts firm offers oil
changes and tire checks while customers are vacationing. A
New York discount broker will negotiate the price of a new
car. And for people who find confrontations taxing, a
"counselor" at a car-repair hot line will ask the local
garage some hard questions about that $800 job it is
proposing.
   Entrepreneurs find the demand is huge. "There is nothing
people hate more than going into a car dealer's," says Seth
Furst, owner of Auto Consumers Inc. of New York. "They want
to drive their kids to the Little League game or a birthday
party on a Saturday afternoon, not talk to some guy in a
polyester suit and stained tie."
   So his clients, who he says have included fashion
photographer Bruce Weber and actor Tom Cruise, tell him what
new car they want, and he does the haggling. He also advises
them against certain models and extras (notably rust-proofing
contracts). He says he handles about 1,000 sales a year.
   Mr. Furst considers himself something of a psychologist.
He talked one woman, who had moved to Connecticut from
Manhattan and become pregnant with her first child, out of
buying a Volvo station wagon. He figured she was playing an
unaccustomed role of suburban housewife and steered her
toward an Acura Legend, which he considers "more reliable."
   Another consultant for car buyers, Stan Madeloff, founder
of Jenlor Co. of Canton, Mass., used to recruit and train
personnel for car dealerships but "switched sides" about five
years ago. Today, he says, his mission is to fend off
"surprises and exorbitant overcharges" for consumers. He
recalls the desperate phone call he got from a young man.
"The kid was in tears," he says. "Three people {at a
dealership} had been working on him for 1 1/2 hours in a back
room. They wouldn't let him leave."
   Car/Puter International Corp. of Dania, Fla., helps people
buy cars, too, but doesn't do the negotiating. It furnishes
computerized printouts with pricing information -- including
the price dealers pay and the latest rebates and financial
incentives -- on any make of car. Buyers who can't wait can
get "instant pricing" through a 900 telephone number.
   A recent Car/Puter innovation holds vast pampering
potential: car repair hot lines. On the hot lines, some 30
"counselors" help diagnose cars' mechanical problems. They
will also "talk to your mechanic to make sure the price isn't
out of line," says Alan Schein, Car/Puter's vice president.
An auto-pricing hot line estimates the best prices for used
cars and, for buyers, arranges inspections. A
government-auction hot line gives dates and locations of
public sales. "We try to take the mystery out" of the
automobile business, says Arnold Wonsever, the company's
president.
   Other services have other gimmicks. Oilco, formed this
year in Braintree, Mass., sends equipped vans to parking lots
to do lubrications, change oil and filters, inspect motor
fluids, replace worn filters, wipers and lights, and adjust
the tire pressure.
   "There's no waiting in line, no taking time off from
work," exults John Cozzi, a marketing consultant who is
helping to set up the company. He is about to add two vans to
the single one now operating and is putting together a $2
million financing package to increase the fleet to 30. He
predicts the service will "change the automotive habits of
the U.S."
   Already, Oilco services 15 manufacturing companies. It
says it expects to sign contracts shortly with a group of
Boston parking garages and a department-store chain, and it
is contacting cruise lines, airports, office buildings,
supermarkets and other owners or managers of parking lots.
While customers of these companies buy groceries or cruise
the Caribbean, Oilco will be working on their cars. When they
return, they will find that Oilco employees have left an
apple on the dashboard and looped a thank-you note over the
rear-view mirror.
   Some companies that have long traveled to the customer are
finding new ways to pamper. Robert Turner, owner of Turner's
of Califon in Califon, N.J., got started by changing oil in
people's driveways. Now, he restores and repairs luxury and
antique cars, and his workers wear gloves to prevent smudging
as they transport vehicles to his shop in a special van. "I
get a lot of worried-father, `my-baby's-gone' type of thing
-- people who call every day to see how their car is," Mr.
Turner says.
   Entrepreneurs also find pampering opportunities in rental
cars. In Millburn, N.J., family-owned Instant Rent a Car
delivers cars to the curbs of clients' homes at a moment's
notice. "About half the people can't get here {to the
car-rental office} because their car is broken down, and
about half just don't want to," owner Dennis Pryor says. Such
a slothful attitude bothers him not at all. "If I was sitting
at home, I'd have a car delivered, too," he says.
   But rental pampering isn't limited to the cars themselves.
LapStop Corp. of Salem, Mass., rents lap-top computers and
other equipment to Avis Inc. customers. The service, begun in
April at five airports, spares travelers the bother of
lugging their own machines on a plane.
   With so many small companies indulging one or another of a
motorist's wants, the opportunity looms for somebody to try
to satisfy all a car owner's driving desires. New York City's
AutoTech Center, an affiliate of privately held Garage
Management Corp., believes it has seized that chance. Its
goal is to spoil its customers rotten.
   Employees at its six-floor garage on Manhattan's posh
Upper East Side will pick up, park and deliver your car,
lease you a car and get special insurance discounts for it,
superclean your car in a "detailing salon" for $185, repair
your car, tint your car's windows, and sell and install
accoutrements in your car ranging from $4,500 leather seats
to cellular phones. Favored customers are even driven to
their workplace.
   "We don't have any competition," boasts Michael Glickman,
the president and a principal shareholder. "We're a one-stop
shop."
