   WASHINGTON -- The Transportation Department approved
Scandinavian Airlines System's proposal to purchase Frank
Lorenzo's stake in Continental Airlines Holdings.
   SAS and Continental, which is the parent company of
Continental Airlines, announced SAS's proposed acquisition of
Mr. Lorenzo's stockholdings on Aug. 9. The transaction would
boost SAS's equity stake to 16.8%.

   The department said that, upon completion of the
transaction, Continental would continue to be "fit" to
operate an airline. In addition, it said the transaction
complies with federal laws requiring that U.S. carriers
remain under the control of U.S. citizens.
   Mr. Lorenzo would receive more than $30 million for his
shares.
