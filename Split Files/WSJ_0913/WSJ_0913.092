   Alexander Cockburn's Aug. 16 column proves that no matter
how outrageous and one-sided his columns, he can top himself.
   First he takes the musings of "a former Jordanian
minister" about Israeli expansion into Jordan and establishes
that as a policy that might be followed by Israel -- without
a shred of evidence.

   Then he cites Amnesty International's reports on
atrocities in Iraq, but unless my memory fails me, in all his
articles seeking out Middle Eastern infractions of human
rights he has managed to continually cite Israel and until
now ignore violations in Arab countries.
   And then he totally ignores contemporary history by
comparing Israel's defensive wars of self-preservation to
Iraq's unprovoked attack on Kuwait. While one can argue about
Lebanon and might quibble about 1967 (when virtually all
observers considered Egypt's closing of vital waterways as
tantamount to an attack), only a fool could consider Israel's
response to an attack on its holiest day in 1973 wrong. Mr.
Cockburn is of course too opinionated to cite 1948, when all
surrounding nations attacked Israel or the fact that Jordan
attacked Israel in 1967, leading to Israel's capture of
former Jordanian territories, or that Saddam Hussein, in this
very paper less than two months ago, said that the Arab
world's biggest mistake was ignoring Israel's offer to
negotiate after the 1967 war and return captured territories.
   Israelis do not have "immense joy" because of the PLO
support of Iraq. They know that Saddam is a tyrant and that
if Israel had not acted to stop his nuclear capability in
1981, American soldiers would need far more than gas masks
today.
