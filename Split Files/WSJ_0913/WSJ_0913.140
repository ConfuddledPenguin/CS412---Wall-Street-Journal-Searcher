   Hyundai Motor, the South Korean auto maker dogged by
flagging U.S. car sales, is doing some major body work on its
low-price image.
   This month, Hyundai will wheel out a new ad campaign
designed to convince car buyers that it knows how to make
stylish cars that hip people like to be seen in. The campaign
will spotlight its new Scoupe sporty coupe, which Hyundai
hopes will become popular among folks in their 20s and 30s.

   "We've begun to reposition the Hyundai brand name and our
individual models as the best combination anywhere of value,
performance, quality and dependability," says Rod Hayden,
executive vice president and chief operating officer of
Hyundai Motor America.
   But Hyundai faces an enormous challenge. The company is
plagued by a reputation for offering no-frills cars that
aren't quite as good as their Japanese and U.S. competitors.
And its once bargain-priced cars aren't as cheap as they used
to be, thanks to higher wages in South Korea and the won's
strength against the dollar.
   Indeed, its new ad campaign, created by Backer Spielvogel
Bates's Irvine, Calif., office, plays down the
cost-consciousness that was the focus of its most recent
"Cars That Make Sense" campaign. Hyundai has swapped its
price pitch for ads that have the glitzy feel of some
luxury-car ads.
   One ad for the Scoupe shows the car cruising at high
speeds through smoky city streets late at night. "This car
will do wonders for your image . . . and ours," the announcer
says. The Scoupe then whizzes past a small group of
club-going types dressed in black who turn around just in
time to get a view of the car as it speeds away. "The new
Scoupe from Hyundai. Yes, Hyundai," is the kicker.
   Another ad shows the Scoupe speeding along a freeway --
but the entire scene is shown upside down. Near the end of
the spot, the camera turns right side up and the announcer
says, "You'll find this sporty new coupe so much fun, you may
never look at Hyundai quite the same way again."
   The "Hyundai. Yes, Hyundai," theme line appears at the end
of all the new spots. "It's an answer to the various
surprises that we expect people" to have, says Harry Grusche,
senior vice president of Backer Spielvogel, a unit of Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi.
   Hyundai badly needs the marketing make over. Through the
first eight months of the year, Hyundai sales declined more
than 29% to just 93,421 cars from 132,440 cars in the
year-earlier period. Part of Hyundai's problem has been
softness in the market for subcompact cars, where sales have
fallen 18% so far this year.
   Marketing experts are skeptical that Hyundai will be able
to woo a much hipper crowd simply by running slick ads.
"You've got to wonder, just how up-market can you push this?"
asks Richard Winger, a partner at Boston Consulting Group in
New York. Mr. Winger notes that raising the image of any
no-frills product is a difficult proposition.
   But Hyundai insists consumers who may not have considered
its cars before will give them a chance when they see the new
ads on such TV shows as "Twin Peaks" and "Saturday Night
Live." The car maker says, further, that the cars consumers
see will impress them: Hyundai recently made a number of
changes on its Excel and Sonata models.
   Hyundai said it has planned a stepped-up fourth-quarter ad
budget to aggressively promote the launch of the new ads. In
1989, Hyundai spent $87 million on ads for its passenger
cars, according to Leading National Advertisers, a firm that
tracks ad spending.
   "We still do make cars that make sense," says Maurice
Bowen, Hyundai's national manager of advertising. "But we
want to tell consumers that they owe it to themselves to give
Hyundai a second look."

   Saatchi Is Keeping Siegel
                                                                                                       

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has decided to keep its Siegel &amp; Gale
design group, a small unit that was widely expected to be
bought back by management. The battered British advertising
giant has been trying to raise cash by seeking to sell a
number of its non-core ad businesses in the U.S.
   The Siegel negotiations apparently stalled over purchase
price. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Saatchi's chief executive
officer, "approached us and said he would entertain an offer"
for a management buy-out, said Alan Siegel, the firm's
chairman and chief executive. But Mr. Louis-Dreyfus decided
"the price that we could afford to pay for it wasn't worth
it," Mr. Siegel said. "He wasn't going to sell a company at a
discount."
   Mr. Siegel said the two months of talks had ended because
Saatchi recognizes Siegel's "future growth and profit
prospects." Saatchi has promised continued financial support
so the two concerns can "build on their existing business
relationship," the statement added.

   PILLSBURY ACCOUNT: Pillsbury, a unit of Grand Metropolitan
PLC, is talking to several agencies about the ad assignment
for a breakfast toaster pastry product, industry executives
said. Leo Burnett, one of Pillsbury's largest agencies, isn't
in the running, because the product resembles Pop-Tarts, made
by Kellogg, another large Burnett client. Billings are
estimated at $5 million to $10 million.
                                                                                                       

   NETWORK PROMOTION: McDonald's and NBC announced details of
their joint "McMillions" sweepstakes promotion for the fall
TV season. Game cards for the $35.5 million contest will be
handed out at McDonald's stores. Winning card numbers will be
announced on prime-time shows on NBC, a General Electric
unit.
                                                                                                       

   RCA CAMPAIGN: Nipper, the RCA mascot dog that listens for
"his master's voice," is being revived in a series of new TV
spots for the RCA brand of Thomson SA's Thomson Consumer
Electronics'. The ads, which promote RCA's "Home Theatre"
line of large-screen TVs and other RCA lines, feature a
real-life Nipper barking alongside a look-alike puppy in a
bid to secure the loyalty of consumers under 40. Ammirati &amp;
Puris, New York, created the ads.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNTS: Sears, Roebuck named Mullen, Wenham, Mass.,
to handle the national launch of Sears Vacation Travel, which
will market vacation packages. Billings weren't disclosed. .
. . Sussman/Ziccardi Group, New York, won accounts for Random
House Video and George Braziller Publishers.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: Ann Meschery and Charles Rutman were named
executive vice presidents at Backer Spielvogel, New York.
