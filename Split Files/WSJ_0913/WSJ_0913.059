   NEW YORK -- GTE Airfone Inc. signed an agreement with
Communications Satellite Corp. to carry Airfone's
aircraft-based phone traffic internationally by mid-1991.
   The move by the GTE Corp. unit comes as rival
international phone services such as British Airways Skyphone
and Aeronautical Radio Inc. have been formed to challenge
Airfone's position in the fledgling aircraft phone service
business.

   "Our customers . . . require the availability of global
communications while inflight from anywhere in the world,"
said Mark S. Schneider, Airfone's marketing vice president.
   Airfone will use the satellite ground stations in
Southbury, Conn. and Santa Paula, Calif., that are operated
by Comsat Aeronautical Services, a unit of Comstat, which is
based in Washington. The network also will have data-carrying
capability.
   In addition, Comsat will arrange for additional global
links through the satellite system operated by the
International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat).
   Airfone, which began operations in 1984, has installed
air-to-ground phones in more than 1,300 aircraft or about a
third of the U.S. airlines' domestic fleet. Airfone also
operates Railfone, a public phone service on Amtrak trains.
In April, the Federal Communications Commission formally
established aircraft phones as a regular communications
service and opened the field to potential competitors. GTE
has been trying to block from the business one of those
rivals, In-Flight Phone, which was founded by Airfone's
creator John D. Goeken. Their squabble is now in the courts.
