   AON MADE A BID of $40-a-share, or $840 million, for
insurance broker Corroon &amp; Black. The offer challenges a $703
million stock-swap pact under which Corroon agreed to merge
with Willis Faber, a London-based insurance broker. Aon's
move is one of the first major public bidding battles in a
year marked by a dearth of high-profile takeover fights.
