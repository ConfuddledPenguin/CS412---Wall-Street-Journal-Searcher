   American Airlines wants to play "Let's Make A Deal" with
its frequent fliers.
   Behind Door No. 1 is a dream vacation, starting with a
free, first-class, round-trip airline ticket from New York to
Hawaii, worth $3,000. Behind Door No. 2 is a $1,200 discount
on a brand-spanking-new Toyota Cressida. Either one is yours
in exchange for 60,000 of the frequent-flier credits you have
accumulated over the years.

   Which would you choose? American, the nation's largest
airline, hopes fervently that some of its frequent fliers
will opt for the less-expensive Door No. 2, which will enable
American to erase at least some of its sizable liability for
unclaimed trips at a relatively low cost.
   But American's program, announced last week, uses a
confusing barter system that experts say will annoy some
travelers -- and cause others to make some ill-advised
decisions. Worse, some of the new discounts are barely
discounts at all because some merchandise is being sold at
inflated prices. Even inexperienced shoppers may do almost as
well buying the goods at stores -- without having to
relinquish their precious miles.
   "You already needed a road map to get through these
programs," says John Holland, publisher of Business Flyer
magazine. "This just makes it a lot tougher."
   American, a unit of AMR Corp., says it is only giving
frequent fliers what they asked for: a chance to win more
than just another ride in a plane. "If you take 20 trips a
year, you may not want an extra trip," says Michael Gunn,
American's senior vice president of marketing. And analysts
say that even if the plan has shortcomings, American's huge
marketing clout will force at least some competitors to copy
the program.
   Under the new plan, which American spent a year
developing, frequent fliers can earn rebates on a host of
big-ticket items listed in a glossy catalog, including cars,
computers, jewelry and even financial services. All they have
to do is give up a sizable chunk of the mileage credits they
have been hoarding for that vacation to the French Riviera.
   It's a profitable swap for American, since it may reduce
the huge amount of mileage that fliers have accumulated over
the years without forcing the airline to dole out tons of
free airline tickets to fliers who may then squeeze out
paying passengers. American declines to discuss its
liability, but the newsletter Frequent estimates the carrier
has a potential liability of 70 billion unused miles.
   American also is paying almost nothing for the new perks.
The companies selling the products cover the discounts, in
exchange for being in the widely distributed catalog. "We get
to reach just the sort of affluent people we want," says
Robert Miller, president of the Fur Vault Inc.
   But travelers may have mixed feelings. They can get some
truly unique awards: For 20,000 miles, they can buy
certificates of deposits at a lower price and higher yield
than the general public. But the awards vary widely in their
monetary value: 50,000 miles qualifies for a $1,000 discount
off a personal computer or $3,130 off a player piano. Some of
the products also must be bought at the prices listed in the
catalog, no matter how far those prices wander from store
prices.
   By cashing in 20,000 miles, for example, American's fliers
can chop 35% off the $4,164 price of a Baldwin floor clock.
But Ken Klopp, a divisional vice president for Baldwin Piano
&amp; Organ Co., concedes the same clock sells for 20% to 35% off
at many outlets anyway. "Obviously, it's not a good deal at
20,000 miles" in some cases, he says, quickly adding that a
better discount is available for 30,000 miles, and that
ordering through a catalog is often more convenient than
shopping in a store, even if it's not always cheaper.
   Similarly, a Fur Vault store in Atlanta said it had a
50-inch mink coat on sale for $1,700, about the same it would
cost fliers to buy the coat through the catalog and give up
35,000 miles. However, Mr. Miller said, judging fur prices is
difficult because quality differs from coat to coat.
   Critics say frequent fliers could end up short-changing
themselves by picking merchandise over the standard free
ticket. To earn the discount, after all, the traveler still
must make a purchase, usually an expensive one. And there's
only one brand of each product in the catalog. "This is
pretty worthless if the car you want isn't a Toyota," says
Randy Petersen, editor of Frequent magazine.
   For its part, American maintains that assigning values to
free tickets is futile; a free ticket may be worthless to a
flier fed up with traveling. Any discrepancies in value, the
airline adds, came because it negotiated separately with each
vendor. The airline also insists that most of the discounts
represent true bargains, though there could be some
exceptions. "As the pioneer of this, we're sort of learning
as we go along," says Mr. Gunn.
   In the meantime, frequent fliers are working furiously on
ways to get the most mileage out of the plan. Some say the
best bargains are rebates that can be applied after a
purchase is made; that way, the vendor can't use inflated
retail prices. Others say the certificate of deposit, used as
a way to guarantee payment for a child's future college
education, may be one of the best deals. For 60,000 miles,
College Savings Bank in Princeton, N.J., says it will give
fliers 8% off all long-term CD payments over five years --
which works out to a $4,800 savings on $60,000 deposited.
   But one of the best tricks, says Mr. Petersen, is to buy
the awards with a credit card that's linked to American's
frequent-flier program. Since American credits one mile for
every dollar purchased on certain cards, the traveler can
reduce the mileage that's being drained.
