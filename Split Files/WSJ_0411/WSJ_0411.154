   Sometime this summer, New York diners will be introduced
to four Texas Tortilla Bakery fast-food restaurants, created
by Philip J. Romano.
   If consumers go for his spicy Tex-Mex fare, the
50-year-old San Antonio, Texas, entrepreneur will have a
culinary hit on his hands. That wouldn't be unusual: Mr.
Romano created Fuddruckers, a nationwide gourmet-hamburger
chain based in San Antonio, and recently sold his Romano's
Macaroni Grill concept to Chili's Inc., Dallas, for 30 times
his investment cost.

   But if the Texas Tortilla units flop, that also wouldn't
be unusual. Mr. Romano has tasted failure more than once. Yet
Mr. Romano shows that by constantly trying new concepts and
moving quickly past failures, an entrepreneur can achieve
long-term survival in even the most mercurial of industries.
   Few businesses are as risky as restaurants. With much of
the business shifting into the hands of powerful chains,
independents can be squeezed out in a heartbeat. And still
they come, thousands of new U.S. restaurateurs every year,
seeking a piece of a $200 billion-a-year market.
   Few have handled the dangers as well -- or as often -- as
Mr. Romano. He has anticipated consumer trends and shown a
knack for promotional gimmickry. Like many other
entrepreneurs, he fits no ordinary corporate mold. For
example, as the chairman of Fuddruckers, he was known to
appear at board meetings in a suit and tie -- but without
socks. When his attorney pointed out the incongruity, Mr.
Romano held out his bare hands and claimed he was wearing
hosiery to match his gloves.
   Since dropping out of the business program at Florida
Atlantic College in 1968, Mr. Romano has been a prolific
innovator. He claims to have caught the salad-bar trend early
at his first restaurant, the Nag's Head Bar in West Palm
Beach, Fla. To attract an exclusive clientele to his Key Hole
Restaurant, which he opened there in 1969, he padlocked the
door and sent keys to lawyers and other professionals. Their
secretaries could also get a free key and cheap drinks, a
gimmick that turned them into de facto salespeople for the
restaurant, which was a big hit.
   With meat prices soaring in the mid-70s, Mr. Romano jacked
up prices 30% at his Friends of Edinburgh Scottish Pub, also
in West Palm Beach. But, after printing new menus, he issued
the old ones to regular customers. They continued to pay the
old prices as long as they brought the menus along. And to
push more customers through his lunch-oriented First National
Bar &amp; Grill there, Mr. Romano had them punch time clocks and
pay by the minute.
   The tricks have usually worked, but not always. Mr.
Romano's Pasta Palace, a combination art-deco movie house and
pasta restaurant, opened in West Palm Beach in 1975, about 10
years before art deco or pasta became chic in Florida. The
restaurant closed fairly quickly.
   Mr. Romano thought he was catching the consumer wave for
lighter fare with his health-oriented 1985 entry in San
Antonio, the Stix Eating Spa. But sales fell way below his
expectations. Researchers said Stix had exceedingly loyal
customers among people who earned more than $75,000 a year;
unfortunately, only 8,000 people in San Antonio made that
much. "It was the right restaurant in the wrong place," says
Mr. Romano, who closed it.
   For a time, Fuddruckers -- founded in 1980 -- was one of
the hottest chain concepts around. But Mr. Romano
overestimated the public's willingness to shell out $5 for a
hamburger. Meanwhile, the huge McDonald's chain broadened its
menu, and rival gourmet-burger operations, such as Chili's,
quickly juggled their menus to keep a step ahead of consumer
tastes. And Mr. Romano -- this time, anyway -- wasn't fleet
enough in adjusting. In 1985, Fuddruckers had a loss of $5.4
million. Mr. Romano sold it the next year.
   Mr. Romano says the chain faltered because it drifted too
far from its original menu. As it happens, however, Mr.
Romano became a multimillionaire by selling his stake in the
company. In addition, 10 investors earned $3.5 million each
on their $15,000 investments in Fuddruckers.
   The restaurateur hasn't done badly with Romano's Macaroni
Grill, either. Starting two years ago with $150,000 of his
own money and memories of his grandfather's warm Italian
kitchen, he built a homey prototype in San Antonio with long
wooden tables and cheap jug wines. To generate excitement on
slow nights, Mr. Romano offers free meals to all patrons on
one Monday or Tuesday a month. The catch: Customers don't
know if they've come on a free night until they get their
bills. The promotion costs about $1,500 a month, far less
than the $5,000 to $6,000 that the restaurant would otherwise
spend on advertising. "I believe a restaurant should be
talked about, not advertised," Mr. Romano says.
   Chili's bought rights to the concept late last year, for
$4.5 million, and plans to open its first such unit this
fall, in north Dallas. Meanwhile, Mr. Romano has moved on to
the next challenge: selling New Yorkers his Tex-Mex fare,
meaning fajitas, soft tacos (made with flour tortillas, not
corn), burritos and refritos (refried beans). Mr. Romano says
a scarcity of soft-shell tacos in Manhattan is what prompted
him and a New York partner to raise $500,000, through a
public offering, to create Texas Tortilla Bakery Inc. to put
Texas Torilla Bakery outlets in Manhattan (Mr. Romano has a
20% stake). They'll sell soft tacos, singly and by the
bucket.
   The Texas Tortilla units -- for which no prototype exists,
not even in Texas -- face formidable hurdles in Manhattan.
There are about 12,000 competing restaurants in Manhattan,
and overhead is stiff: The company paid $100,000 to sign a
Manhattan lease and renovate the space for its first Texas
Tortilla restaurant, twice as much as a Dallas opening would
cost.
   But Mr. Romano and his partner, Arthur Powers, are
convinced that New Yorkers will embrace their promise to
provide quick service in the middle of the day. Working in
their favor will be the paucity of low-priced Mexican cuisine
in Manhattan. New York lacks large numbers of Mexican-born
residents who might open such restaurants. Some fast-food
outlets do feature Mexican food, but Mr. Romano says his
Tex-Mex fare will be new to many New Yorkers. And it will be
priced well below the fancier Mexican fare that many
Manhattan restaurants already offer.
   To promote the venture, Mr. Romano thought of giving away
scrip to his first few thousand customers, who could use it
to buy stock in the company. But he says he dropped the idea
-- as too unwieldy -- after the Securities and Exchange
Commission staff advised him that he would also have to hand
out prospectuses.
