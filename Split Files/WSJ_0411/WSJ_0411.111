   TOKYO -- Machinery orders received by Japanese companies
in February rose 29.4% from a year earlier to 1.659 trillion
yen ($10.48 billion), the Economic Planning Agency said.
   The gain, following a 0.2% year-on-year dip in December
and an 11.3% increase in January, resulted from substantial
increases of orders in all categories, an agency official
said. With the exception of December 1989, machinery orders
have been rising since October 1988.
