   TAX-PREPARER FEES aren't likely to rise much over the next
few years.
   After hefty fee increases over the past three years, fees
for preparing your tax return "have stabilized," says Robert
Israeloff, who heads Israeloff, Trattner &amp; Co., CPAs in
Valley Stream, N.Y. The intricacies of the 1986 tax act
spurred 10% to 30% jumps in fees of smaller accounting firms
from 1987 through 1989, says Israeloff. The act boosted
training and time to prepare returns, he says, expecting
modest fee increases of 5% to 8% this year.

   Bigger accounting firms were forced to almost double their
preparer fees in 1987 after the 1986 act. That year the firms
also had to boost salaries of college graduates by up to 30%
to match pay rises at Price Waterhouse, a major firm. "And we
also had to introduce costly new computer software, which
boosted fees," says Janice Johnson, a BDO Seidman tax
partner. "Now that's all behind us and fees shouldn't rise
much."
   Big preparer H&amp;R Block has kept fees flat since '86 and
won't raise them now. More short-form usage "is keeping
average fees near $50," says Block.
                                                                                                       

   A STINGY GIFT-TAX proposal has estate planners rushing
clients to give.
   The proposal, now before the House Ways and Means
Committee, would limit to $30,000 the amount that each
individual donor can give. Donors can now give as many
$10,000 gifts as they want without having to worry about the
steep 37% federal gift tax kicking in. A committee staffer
says, "There was a feeling" among members of the House
Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, which proposed the
measure, "that there was a potential for abuse here."
   It's unclear whether the issue ever will be put to a vote,
but accountants and estate planners, to be on the safe side,
are counseling clients to give gifts early this year. John L.
Pritchard, a South Orange, N.J., lawyer specializing in tax
planning, is urging well-heeled clients to write checks now
rather than waiting for Christmas. Laura Shanley, a tax
partner at Ernst &amp; Young, CPAs, is offering the same advice
but says only a few clients have taken it to heart.
                                                                                                       

   THE SENECAS' CLASH with New York state over sales tax
isn't resolved.
   In a landmark agreement, the state and the Indian tribe
had made peace and decided to let the tribe collect and keep
a sales tax on gasoline and cigarettes sold to non-Indians on
two reservations. Indians on reservations are exempt from
sales taxes. But opposition from off-reservation truck stops
and oil firms and intra-tribal dissension stalled legislative
approval of the pact.
   "We likely won't get the needed OK from the state assembly
this year," says State Tax Commissioner James Wetzler. So the
state now plans to crack down on truckers who pay no state
tax for fuel bought on the reservation but still take the
full 18-cent-a-gallon tax as a credit to reduce state
highway-use taxes. And the state will audit reservation
stores to get them to levy the tax on non-Indians.
   Some Indian lands are being used "to launder
off-reservation gas and cigarette sales to avoid tax," says
Wetzler.
                                                                                                       

   WIDELY CRITICIZED RULES will get an earlier hearing by the
IRS. Controversial regulations disallowing losses on the sale
of stock in a subsidiary prompted many requests to move up
the hearing dates from next October. So the IRS has agreed to
hold hearings June 26-27, with comments due by June 12.
                                                                                                       

   TIP TO THE TIPSY: Judy Ann Webb, an Elyria, Ohio,
waitress, told the tax court that in 1984 she "got loaded,"
gave away some tips, and underreported income by $2,800 as a
result. She said she didn't think given-away tips must be
reported, but the court ruled she still owed tax of $435 on
the tips she didn't keep.
                                                                                                       

   EXPENSIVE TRAINING: Taking experienced agents off the job
to train 1,100 new revenue agents could cost the IRS nearly
$1 billion in unrealized audit revenue, a new General
Accounting Office report says. The IRS acknowledges it loses
money when it diverts senior agents, and it is considering
contracting people from the private sector to train agents.
                                                                                                       

   CONSUMERS' APPETITE for self-help tax-preparation guides
remains hearty.
   Digestion of changes brought by the Tax Reform Act of 1986
hasn't damped sales. Prentice Hall Trade, which publishes
J.K. Lasser's tax guide, expects total shipments to run at
least 10% ahead of the 513,000 shipped in 1989. Prentice Hall
also markets a book and software package. Ernst &amp; Young's
Arthur Young 1990 guide, published by Ballantine Books, is a
top seller, with 440,000 books shipped in 1989 alone.
Publishers Weekly ranks Consumer Reports' tax guide third by
shipments.
   Sales of software programs are brisk, estimated to be
running about 100,000 more this year than the 300,000 of a
year ago. Chipsoft's Turbo Tax Personal 1040 is ranked
highest in unit sales by Softsel Computer Products, a
wholesaler, and by Waldenbooks. Sales of Andrew Tobias's
TaxCut, which incorporated the Ask DAN About Your Taxes
program, passed the 100,000 mark. Waldenbooks says the Lasser
software packages also sell well.
   Steven Murphy, of Prentice Hall, says, "There aren't as
many new tax issues," but circumstances change.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Arthur L. Nims III is re-elected chief judge of
the U.S. Tax Court for a two-year term. . . . Rhyme with
reason: "April is the cruelest month," the poet wrote of
tax-time tension. "But August could be just as bad, if you
file for an extension."
