   Next PLC said it had a pretax loss of #46.7 million ($76.4
million) in the year ended Jan. 31, reflecting a downturn in
consumer spending and the slower growth of sales compared
with retail costs.
   The pretax loss at the British retailer compares with a
year-earlier pretax profit of #62.3 million. Market
expectations had called for pretax profit of about #28
million to #32 million. In trading on London's Stock Exchange
yesterday, Next dropped 8 pence to 71 pence.
