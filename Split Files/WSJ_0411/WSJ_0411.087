   WARSAW (AP) -- The Gdansk shipyard where the Solidarity
trade union was born will be sold to workers and the public
under Poland's new rules for creating private companies from
stateowned enterprises, workers were told.
   Shipyard manager Hans Szyt read a telegram from Industry
Minister Tadeusz Syryjczyk announcing the decision during a
rally by 2,000 workers protesting the slow pace of government
decisions on the facility's fate.

   "Poland should finally understand that we were fighting
for everybody, but we {at the shipyard} had nothing out of
it," Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said at the rally. "The
time of struggle is over. . . . Now we are fighting for
ourselves."
   Each share will be sold to the public for 10,000 zlotys
(about $1.05). Shipyard workers can purchase 20% of the
shares at half price, Mr. Syryjczyk said.
   Previous discussions on saving the shipyard had focused on
a much-publicised offer from Polish-born American heiress
Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, but discussions apparently snagged
on the workers' refusal to accept the pay and no-strike
agreements she required.
