   Martech, an environmental cleanup company based in
Anchorage, Alaska, said it will form a joint venture with Geo
Test, a Czechoslovakian engineering and hydrology company.
   Martech said there are more than 165 Russian bases and
other contaminated sites in Czechoslovakia. It said it will
begin work April 25 in Frenstat, at the first base to be
evacuated by Soviet troops.
