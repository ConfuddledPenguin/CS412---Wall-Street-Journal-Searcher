   Good advice in hunting homes
   The bright suburban way
   Is: Learn what you are looking for --
   Ranchero? Cute Chalet?
   Casita? Vivienda? One
   At Dockside? Villa West?
   Hilltop? Windsong? Great Tree Farms?
   All different from the rest?
   To buy, you must decide by name --
   Don't waver, don't retreat;
   No subdivision offers you
   A house along a street.
   -- Ralph Shaffer.

   Here's how one fellow saved money this winter: He
converted his furnace from burning oil to burning gift
catalogs.
