   Bess Myerson, Nancy Capasso, Hortense Gabel and her
daughter Sukhreet Gabel are four of the most bizarre women
I've ever encountered between the covers of a book -- fiction
or nonfiction -- from "Geek Love" to Havelock Ellis.
   They are the major players in "When She Was Bad" (Random
House, 305 pages, $19.95), Shana Alexander's account of the
rise and fall of Bess Myerson, the first Jewish Miss America,
who emerged from a Bronx housing project to become a regular
on television quiz shows, a nationally known consumer
advocate, a spokeswoman for Citicorp, a candidate for the
U.S. Senate, an ostensibly heterosexual arm-ornament for New
York's single Mayor Edward Koch, and his cultural affairs
commissioner.

   Somewhere along the line, however, Bess's fast-track train
derailed -- and, at 64 she ended up a convicted shoplifter
and geriatric home wrecker on trial with her two-decades
younger, mob-connected sewer-contractor boyfriend, Andy
Capasso, for trying to suborn Judge Gabel to reduce his
alimony payments to his ex-wife, Nancy.
   "When She Was Bad" is by turns sordid, shocking, farcical
and sick-making. It also is nearly impossible to put down.
   The way Ms. Alexander paints it, Bess's mom has a lot to
answer for. A stingy, hard woman, she left her extra-tall
daughter emotionally impoverished and with a lifelong
compulsion to get something for nothing. As she went from job
to job, she ate free meals, accepted free dresses from
designers and organized her life around making free phone
calls -- a nightmare house guest whose weekends in the
country usually were spent racking up hundreds of dollars of
long-distance charges.
   Ms. Alexander identifies Nancy Capasso (nee Roth) as a
"prime example of the so-called Jewish American Princess."
But Bess had pretensions to a higher rank: Bess was -- in her
own words -- "Queen of the Jews." That title meant more to
her than cultural commissioner. More people probably saw Bess
putting on her makeup than clapping loudly at the opera.
   Afflicted with what a nameless TV personality quoted by
Ms. Alexander describes as "a helluva lot of sexual
confusion," Bess sometimes revealed a creepy need to invite
acquaintances to sit and watch her while she applied her
makeup stark naked. Possibly even more disconcerting to her
male or female visitors, was Bess's habit of stroking,
patting or fondling them while she talked, making "a bid for
territorial dominance, something similar to what the male
lion intends when he urinates on thorn bushes."
   And if that isn't screwy enough, Ms. Alexander presents
circumstantial evidence that while Bess was running for the
Senate in 1980, she also found time to harass the new
girlfriend of a former beau with strange mail (including a
plastic Baggie of human excrement) and making up to 40 hangup
phone calls a day.
   Ms. Alexander certainly doesn't go looking for nice things
to say about Bess, though she works overtime to cast Nancy
Capasso in a sympathetic light -- which proves to be beyond
the capacities even of the author of a compassionate book on
Jean Harris, killer of the Scarsdale diet doc. Nancy, a
spoiled Skidmore graduate and bored young mother, threw over
her first husband in 1965 for Capasso, then a 19-year-old
construction worker who had crawled out of a sewer near her
suburban home.
   Soon they were socializing with some of the sleazier
slimeballs afloat in the Gotham-area swamps. Ms. Alexander
gives us a mouthwatering description of the Capassos on
vacation in Palm Beach with their dear friend Queens borough
president Donald Manes, before he, fearing indictment in a
city corruption scandal, skewered himself to death on purpose
with a kitchen knife.
   The most riveting sections recount Bess's weird
relationships with Judge Gabel and her unemployable,
overweight daughter Sukhreet. After more than 200 job leads
failed to pan out for Sukhreet, her mother would press
Sukhreet's resume on anyone who entered her office.
   Bess, however, not only hired Sukhreet, she befriended
her: inviting Sukhreet to compare anti-depressant drugs and
to watch her dress. When it dawned on Sukhreet that her boss
might have cultivated her not for her charm but her mother's
influence, she flew into a tizzy -- volunteering to testify
against Bess and her mother.
   Unfortunately for Sukhreet, her revenge plot, like nearly
everything else in her life, failed miserably. She proved to
be an unconvincing witness, whose curious appearance ("a
pop-eyed . . . woman wearing Mother Superior-style robes and
a red fright wig") and wacky testimony probably helped Bess
get off.
   A writer slightly more sensitive might have found some
pathos in these four women and their stories. Ms. Alexander
can't squeeze out a drop: Her narrative unfolds like a Monty
Python remake of "The Snake Pit." And you don't have to be a
Bess partisan to wonder sometimes where she got many details.
For example, after her acquittal, Bess and and a friend
celebrated with "vodka and day-old chicken retrieved from the
refrigerator." Now just how did Ms. Alexander know it hadn't
sat there for a week?
