   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co., which has been under
attack by advertisers for its controversial ban on ads in
movie theaters, said it hired a research firm to find out how
moviegoers feel about ads.
   Not surprisingly, the survey found that moviegoers don't
like ads. But the company called a news conference to
announce the results.

   Disney said 90% of 18,772 moviegoers surveyed by National
Research Group Inc. said they don't want commercials to be
shown in theaters. However, the poll found that 95% of those
surveyed said they favor movie previews. The poll was
conducted on March 31 in Chicago, Boston, New York and seven
other communities by the research unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Co.
   Jeff Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said
Disney originally thought taking a survey on this subject
would make as much sense as "asking dental patients if they
like root canal." However, he noted that some advertisers
have argued that Disney doesn't have any empirical data
proving that moviegoers don't like advertising.
   The ban on ads, announced in February, went into effect
with the recent opening of Disney's box-office hit "Pretty
Woman." Richard Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista
Pictures Distribution, which distributes Disney pictures,
said there haven't been any theaters that have refused to
comply with the policy.
