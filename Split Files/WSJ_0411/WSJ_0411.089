   WASHINGTON -- In a policy pronouncement applauded by the
bond markets, the federal savings and loan bailout agency
said it would continue interest payments on certain S&amp;L debt
after the S&amp;Ls have been seized by the government.
   It continued to insist that it wasn't required to make the
payments, however.

   Both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. said last month that they were reviewing about $20
billion in S&amp;L debt because of questions about the interest
payments. The questions arose when the government's
Resolution Trust Corp. said it believed that the S&amp;L
restructuring law gave it the authority to abandon interest
payments on certain S&amp;L debt even if the interest was backed
by a variety of collateral.
   The RTC announced last week that it intended to adopt a
policy of making the payments.
   Malcolm Dorris, partner with Dechert Price &amp; Rhoads,
outside counsel to Standard &amp; Poor's, said the rating agency
was pleased with the statement. "From a rating perspective,
it eliminates the concern," he said.
   Frances Bermanzohn, general counsel to the Public
Securities Association, called the RTC policy "a vindication
for bondholders. It will restore calm to markets and investor
confidence in the RTC."
