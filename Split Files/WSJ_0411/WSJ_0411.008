   IN AN ARTICLE on the deregulation of the London stock
market, published in October 1986, this newspaper reported on
a telefax published by a London research firm, Global
Analysis Systems Limited. The Journal did not intend to imply
that the telefax was produced other than as a product of
GAS's research and analysis, or that GAS had any improper
motive for distributing it.
