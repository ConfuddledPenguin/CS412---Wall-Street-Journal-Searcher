   CHICAGO -- William Farley, pinched by a shortage of cash
in his $1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell
Inc., plans to surrender majority ownership of the company he
fought so hard to get, Wall Street sources said.
   It isn't known to what extent the move would reduce Mr.
Farley's control of West Point-Pepperell, but the development
clearly represents a setback. Despite vehement protests from
the venerable textile giant based in West Point, Ga., Mr.
Farley last year wrestled the company away from the fourth
generation of its founding Lanier family. During the bitter
takeover battle, West Point-Pepperell officials warned that
Mr. Farley might have financing problems.

   Now, they are being proven at least partly correct.
According to people on Wall Street, Mr. Farley is offering
certain debt holders a combined stake of 65% in a
restructured version of West Point-Pepperell. The transfer of
the equity stake would help reduce and delay certain interest
payments, sources said.
   Though a major setback for Mr. Farley's once-burgeoning
industrial and investment empire, the exchange offer to
holders of certain notes and preferred stock nevertheless may
be the only strategy that can keep him out of bankruptcy
proceedings.
   Mr. Farley, a leveraged buy-out specialist, previously
sought a debt restructuring in the West Point-Pepperell
acquisition without offering equity, according to a source
close to the transaction. But Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
the investment banker that financed most of Mr. Farley's
acquisitions, has since collapsed.
   Troubles worsened for Mr. Farley last month when the unit
he set up to buy West Point-Pepperell fell into default on
$796 million in bank debt and missed bondholder interest
payments. Of the several entities under Mr. Farley's
corporate umbrella, the bank-loan default affects only West
Point Acquisition, the holding company that has the stock in
West Point-Pepperall's operating arm. The debt is set up to
prevent cross-defaults.
   Details of the offer aren't public, but sources said it
would create a new parent company, to be named West Point
Holdings Corp., which would hold the stock in the operating
unit. Although West Point Holdings would apparently in turn
be a unit of Farley Inc., the debt-equity swap would leave
Mr. Farley a minority shareholder. It isn't known whether
preferred shares held by Mr. Farley would allow him to retain
control of West Point-Pepperell through so-called
super-voting privileges. But it's believed he would keep
majority control of the boards of directors at both West
Point Holdings and the operating unit, West Point-Pepperell.
   Mr. Farley has completed his tender offer on 95% of West
Point-Pepperell, but he is about $83 million short of the
cash needed to complete the transaction. Sources close to the
transaction said his bankers, led by Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and
Bankers Trust Co., are likely to loan him the cash needed to
close the deal if holders of West Point Acquisition bonds and
preferred stock agree to the debt-for-equity exchange.
   Farley officials didn't return telephone calls yesterday,
but people close to the situation say the firm is negotiating
with bankers and bondholders.
   According to people familiar with details of the
debt-for-equity swap, Mr. Farley is offering the equity to
holders of roughly $905 million in West Point Acquisition
senior and subordinated notes and preferred stock. Under
terms of the offer, sources said, equity in the stock held by
the new West Point Holdings would be: senior note holders,
38%; subordinated note holders, 17%; holders of preferred
stock, 10%; and 35% controlled by Mr. Farley.
   The exchange would also reduce the interest rates on
certain of the bonds by about 33% and delay interest and
maturity dates for several years, people close to the
negotiations said.
   The banks are said to have given Mr. Farley until at least
Friday to negotiate the exchange. But rather than force him
into federal bankruptcy-law proceedings, they may extend his
grace period on the default. In a statement yesterday, West
Point-Pepperell said it sold its United Kingdom textile unit,
Arthur Sanderson &amp; Sons, Ltd., for about $96.5 million to
Gamma Holding N.V., a Dutch fabric maker. The sale was
expected as part of Mr. Farley's strategy to sell assets to
help pay debt. Analysts estimate that his total debt in West
Point-Pepperell, including existing assumed obligations, is
more than $2 billion.
   Farley Inc., his closely held manufacturing concern, had a
pretax loss of about $40 million in 1989, analysts estimate.
