   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
clarified that the review of MCI Communications Corp.'s
proposed acquisition of Telecom USA Inc. will take about
three months, unless opponents raised "valid objections."
   The agency yesterday indicated that approval of the
friendly acquisition was expected to take a minimum of six
months. An FCC spokeswoman said MCI and Telecom USA have yet
to file data on their plan with the commission.

   In addition to FCC approval, the merger requires clearance
from Telecom USA shareholders, the Justice Department and
regulatory agencies in states where both companies operate.
