   DETROIT -- The Big Three U.S. auto makers cured most of
their car and truck inventory headaches in the first quarter
but the medicine had the bitter side effect of sharply
reduced earnings.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
shut down virtually all of their North American
automotive-assembly plants in the first two weeks of January
to clear out backed-up car and truck supplies.

   The strategy helped slice first-quarter production 26.5%
from year-earlier levels. But the cuts, along with sales
incentives that averaged $1,000 a vehicle, also slashed the
auto makers' combined first-quarter earnings about 70%,
according to analysts' estimates.
   Big Three net income for the first three months of this
year could fall to roughly $1 billion, analysts said. GM,
Ford and Chrysler are expected to disclose their
first-quarter results later this month or in early May.
   In the 1989 first quarter, the Big Three posted net of
$3.54 billion, the highest combined earnings for any quarter
in history. The record cost them dearly, however, because the
heavy production that generated the earnings led to an
oversupply that plagued auto makers -- and their dealers --
the rest of the year.
   Analysts said they think Chrysler suffered the most during
the 1990 first quarter because it doesn't have strong
overseas operations to buffer difficulties at home. Analysts
are almost universally predicting the No. 3 auto maker will
just manage to break even for the January-March period. Top
Chrysler officials earlier this year hinted that the No. 3
auto maker would probably avoid posting a first-quarter loss,
despite relatively weak sales and production.
   Chrysler reported a $664 million net loss for the fourth
quarter of 1989 after a $577 million charge for plant
closings, staff reductions and discontinued car lines. In the
first quarter of 1989, Chrysler net was $351 million or $1.50
a share.
   Both Ford and GM were substantially aided by
stronger-than-expected European vehicle sales in the first
quarter, analysts said. But the analysts' earnings
predictions for Ford and GM varied widely. The biggest wild
card is the effect of turmoil in the Brazilian economy, which
virtually halted the auto makers' output there in late March.
   Estimates for Ford's first-quarter earnings range from
$710 million, or $1.55 a share, to $465 million, or $1 a
share. Estimates for GM range between $776 million, or $1.10
a share, and $419 million, or 53 cents a share.
   For the 1989 first quarter, Ford reported a January-March
record of $1.64 billion, or $3.44 a share; GM recorded net of
$1.55 billion, or $2.37 a share.
   For Chrysler, at least, the pain may not have ended last
month. Chrysler closed four of its seven U.S. assembly plants
the first week in April, cutting output by some 15,000 cars
and Jeeps. Chrysler also is shuttering a Canadian car plant
for all of April and will lose about four weeks of output
each at its two minivan plants when it closes the facilities
this summer to retool for 1991 models.
   Despite Chrysler's continuing cost-cutting efforts, these
and other factors will continue to damp earnings until at
least the fourth quarter, although analysts say it's too soon
to tell by how much.
   Still, now Chrysler appears to be more optimistic about
second-quarter sales and production than it was a month ago.
Industry sources say the auto maker is planning to build
201,000 cars and 160,000 trucks in the U.S. during
April-June, compared with the 190,000 and 150,000 it was
scheduling in March. The current forecasts are still 24.8%
and 16.2%, respectively, below 1989 levels, however.
   Ford is scheduling second-quarter car output 5.7% below a
year ago at 446,000 vehicles, while truck production should
fall 4.3% to about 422,000 light-duty, medium-duty and
heavy-duty vehicles. GM's estimated second-quarter car
production should fall 12% below 1989; truck output, however,
is expected to rise 6.5%, partly because the auto maker is
building more minivans.
   "The good news is that the sales decline apparently
bottomed during the fourth quarter of 1989," said Robert L.
Rewey, vice president of Ford's North American Automotive
operations. "The bad news is that the recovery likely will be
quite gradual."
   He said Ford still is forecasting that sales for the
entire industry will total 14.5 million cars and trucks in
1990, about the level of 1989, with sales in the second half
of the year "somewhat stronger than the first, assuming a
pickup in economic growth from its present sluggish pace."
   The 26.5% cut in Big Three first-quarter output left GM,
Ford and Chrysler reasonably well-positioned for the second
quarter and the second half of 1990, with car inventories
falling to an average 69-day level at the end of March,
compared with 78 days on Feb. 28 and 82 days a year earlier,
according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry
statistical publication. A return to the sluggish sales of
February, however, would put the companies' current output
schedules in jeopardy. Here's what industry sources say the
10 major U.S. auto makers are currently planning to build in
the second quarter:

   Japanese-based auto makers and Japanese-U.S. joint
ventures will account for roughly 19% of the expected
second-quarter total, down from almost 23% in January-March,
but ahead of the 15% they took in the second quarter of 1989.
