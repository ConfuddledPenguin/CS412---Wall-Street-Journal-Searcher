   NEW YORK -- The dollar tumbled yesterday, its sudden
plunge sparked by an unconfirmed rumor late in the session
that a New York bank's credit rating had been downgraded.
   While the market rumor was soon shrugged off, it prompted
a hefty mark rally as the U.S. unit slipped below the key
1.6850-mark level, dealers said.

   "Below that level, a lot of stop-loss orders drove it
lower," said Graham Beale of HongKong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corp. in New York, noting that much of the session's action
was focused on cross-currency plays.
   The dollar ended the session down nearly two pfennigs
against the mark and lower against all other major currencies
except the Canadian dollar.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6755
marks, down from 1.6935 marks late Monday, and at 157.60 yen,
down from 158.23 yen late Monday. Sterling was quoted at
$1.6453, up from $1.6338 Monday.
   The mark gained against the yen as well, ending the
session at 94.08 yen compared to 93.47 yen late Monday in New
York.
   Traders said volume was thin ahead of the long Easter
holiday weekend, spurring rumor-generated deals and
increasing non-dollar transactions.
   Early Wednesday in Tokyo, trading remained quiet. The
dollar was quoted at 157.62 yen by midmorning, slightly up
from the New York close but down from the Tuesday close of
158.15 yen in Tokyo.
   Douglas Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America,
commented that cross-dealing has increasingly taken center
stage as investors grapple with the dollar's next move.
   "It seems easier to fine-tune cross-rate relationships
than to try and figure out what the dollar may be up to
longer term," he said, noting that trouble in Japan's
financial markets has again brought crossdealing to the
forefront of market activity as Japanese investor capital
floods into other currencies.
   Indeed, one trader in a Frankfurt-based bank said that in
the past few days 70% of mark turnover has been against
currencies other than the dollar.
   The dollar began the New York day on a firm note, edging
gingerly higher throughout most of the session.
   Participants said the U.S. unit dipped slightly on an
early news report that the Group of Seven industrial
democracies issued a blunt warning to Japan that it must
raise interest rates to stabilize its financial markets. But
the unit quickly retraced its losses.
   Traders said the news enhanced the market's perception
that the G-7 isn't willing to help prop up the Japanese unit,
despite vague promises at a meeting Saturday in Paris to
guard against the "undesirable consequences" of a falling
yen.
   The story, initially reported by the Washington Post, said
Japan's reluctance to again boost interest rates was one of
several key factors stopping the G-7 from taking more
aggressive steps to halt the yen's slide.
   Later in the New York session, comments by West German
Finance Minister Helmut Haussmann that he expects the mark to
firm as a result of the planned economic and monetary
unification of the two Germanys lent support to the currency,
dealers said.
   They noted that dollar-mark trading had been largely
sidelined recently as both Germanys haggle over the
appropriate exchange rate for a unified currency and the
inflationary impact of monetary union.
   With so many questions still unanswered about German
monetary unification, investors are reticent to expand their
mark portfolios, traders said.
   And while Mr. Haussmann's comments provided nothing in the
way of substantive details, the market reacted favorably to
the news.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $375 an ounce, down $1. Estimated volume
was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong, gold opened Wednesday at $374.95 an ounce.
