   NEW YORK -- Stocks ended mixed as investors continued to
swap industry groups in a hunt for cheap stocks or companies
with strong earnings.
   Technology stocks gained sharply yesterday following a
strong first-quarter earnings report from Motorola. Airline
and bank issues also attracted buying interest, while energy
stocks headed lower as oil prices continued to fall.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.01 to 2731.08.
Broader market measures had more modest gains: Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-Stock Index, for example, gained 0.70, to 342.07,
the equivalent of a five-point increase in the 30-stock
industrial average. Stocks declining on the New York Stock
Exchange outpaced advancers for the fifth-consecutive day by
740 to 723.
   Big Board volume totaled 136,020,000 shares, up from
114,970,000 shares Monday, the second-slowest trading day of
the year.
   Motorola soared 4 1/4 to 68 1/2 on approximately two
million shares after reporting a 3.2% increase in
first-quarter net income from a year earlier.
   John Lazlo, an analyst at PaineWebber, said the stock rose
sharply because many investors were expecting a disappointing
quarter. Though earnings in the company's communications
sector were "below target," Mr. Lazlo said, "semiconductor
revenues grew more than people thought."
   Rajiv Chaudri, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said he would
boost his estimate of Motorola's full-year earnings to a
range of $4.60 to $4.75 a share from $4.50 a share, based on
the first-quarter report.
   Texas Instruments, another major chip maker, added 2 1/8
to 37 1/2, and computer stocks also recorded solid gains.
International Business Machines rose 3/8 to 105 7/8, Compaq
Computer rose 2 1/8 to 96 1/2, Digital Equipment rose 1 7/8
to 81 7/8 and Hewlett-Packard advanced 1 3/8 to 45 1/8.
   Energy stocks dropped across the board as May crude-oil
futures plunged 76 cents a barrel to $17.68 in New York
trading. Worries about a possible glut had driven the price
of crude down about $1 a barrel last week; the May contract
on West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 71 cents a barrel
Monday.
   Among major oil issues, Exxon remained unchanged at 46,
Texaco eased 5/8 to 58 3/8, Mobil slipped 1/2 to 60 5/8 and
Amoco skidded 1 to 51 3/8. Baker Hughes, which reached an
agreement with the Justice Department that will allow it to
complete a takeover of Norton's oil-services unit, fell 3/4
to 27 1/4; elsewhere in the sector, Rowan dropped 5/8 to 12
1/2 and McDermott International lost 1/2 to 27.
   Bank issues extended their recovery from a sell-off late
last week. Citicorp gained 5/8 to 24 1/4, BankAmerica gained
3/4 to 27 1/8, Chase Manhattan added 5/8 to 28 3/4 and
Manufacturers Hanover rallied 1 1/2 to 33 1/8. Among regional
banks, NCNB rose 1 1/2 to 37 5/8, National City gained 5/8 to
34 1/8, Shawmut National rose 1/2 to 13 1/2 and UJB Financial
added 5/8 to 15 1/8.
   UAL rose 1/4 to 161 1/4 after reaching a definitive
agreement for a buy-out, valued at $200 a share, by the three
principal unions at its United Airlines unit. Other airline
stocks fared much better; AMR, the parent of American
Airlines, climbed 2 to 65 3/8; Delta Air Lines rose 1 1/4 to
72 1/2; USAir Group added 3/4 to 30, and Southwest Airlines
rose 1/2 to 24 1/4.
   Ames Department Stores, the most active Big Board issue,
retreated 7/8 to 2 3/8 on composite volume of 4.8 million
shares in response to news that it plans to close 74 stores
and expects to report a $228 million loss for the fiscal year
ended Jan. 27. The estimated loss was larger than
anticipated.
   TJX, which holds a major stake in Ames as a result of the
company's acquisition of the Zayre discount-store chain in
late 1988, tumbled 1 to 15 1/8 on 2.4 million shares.
   Archer-Daniels-Midland fell 1 to 23 1/8 on 1.4 million
shares. Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns slightly lowered
earnings estimates for the fiscal third quarter ended in
March. The company indicated to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report that its net income may be below the
year-earlier 41 cents a share, although its operating
earnings "should be up."
   Jakarta Growth Fund, a new single-country mutual fund
focusing on Indonesia, slipped below its initial offering
price. Five million shares of the closed-end fund were sold
at $12 apiece; the stock closed at 11 7/8 on its first day of
trading, with volume totaling 1.5 million shares.
   Hilton Hotels dropped 1 1/8 to 51 3/4. Chairman Barron
Hilton told The Wall Street Journal he doesn't plan to put
the company up for sale again. Last month, the company's
board ended a 10-month auction by taking it off the market.
   Springs Industries fell 7/8 to 33 after estimating that
first-quarter earnings were about half the year-earlier level
of 86 cents a share.
   Mesa L.P. dropped 3/8 to 5 1/2. Moody's Investors Services
lowered its rating on the partnership's debt in response to
its decision against selling interests in some of its prime
properties for as much as $400 million.
   Crompton &amp; Knowles gained 1/4 to 33 5/8. The company
raised its quarterly dividend by about 35.5% to 21 cents a
share.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
0.16 to 359.52. Volume totaled 11,770,000 shares, compared
with 12,560,000 shares Monday. There were 281 issues
advancing, 287 declining and 246 were unchanged.
   B.A.T Industries, the most active Amex issue, dropped 3/8
to 12 1/2 as 690,400 shares were traded. British investor Sir
James Goldsmith received a major setback in his effort to
acquire the company as California regulators rejected his
proposed change in control of B.A.T's Farmers Group unit.
   Blount Inc. Class A dropped 1/2 to 12 5/8. The company
reported that first-quarter earnings from continuing
operations declined 24.3% from the year-earlier level.
