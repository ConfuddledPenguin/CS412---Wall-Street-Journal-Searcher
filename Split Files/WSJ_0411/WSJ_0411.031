   MUNICH -- The West German construction industry will grow
faster than gross national product and expand between 4% and
5% this year, the Ifo-Institut for Economic Research said.
   The research institute, which earlier this week forecast
that GNP will grow 3.75% this year, said the number of new
hires in the West German construction industry will jump to
between 20,000 and 30,000 this year. It said that the
construction industry is in the third year of a powerful
expansion and that the growth can't be covered through more
overtime and increases in productivity.

   The construction industry is being propelled primarily by
a surge in housing construction and construction related to
the country's bouyant economy, the institute said.
