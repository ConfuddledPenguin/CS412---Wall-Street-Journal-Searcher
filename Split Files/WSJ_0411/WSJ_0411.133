   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Torchmark Corp., despite last week's
setback in court, began soliciting proxies in support of its
resolution for American General Corp.'s annual meeting
seeking the sale of the company.
   Torchmark said the resolution, for consideration at the
May 2 meeting, calls on American General's board promptly to
seek a sale or merger of the Houston insurer by hiring an
investment banking firm to solicit offers to acquire the
company.

   Torchmark's resolution also calls for the appointment of a
committee of independent directors to evaluate all
acquisition proposals.
   In Houston, an American General spokesman said the company
will make a recommendation to holders about the resolution
"in the near future."
   In a letter mailed to American General holders,
Torchmark's chairman and chief executive officer, R.K.
Richey, said that pending approval of the resolution, the
insurer plans to submit another bid for American General.
   Torchmark officials wouldn't comment further.
   The company earlier proposed acquiring the bigger American
General, its chief rival, for $50 a share, or $6.4 billion,
in cash and stock. That offer, which demanded a response
within 48 hours, was subsequently withdrawn upon being
rebuffed by American General.
   Undeterred, Torchmark then said it planned to solicit
proxies for a proposed slate of nominees to American
General's board. But American General, arguing that the
nominations missed a deadline, last week won a court-ordered
injunction to keep Torchmark at bay.
