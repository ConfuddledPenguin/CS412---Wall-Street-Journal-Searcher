   ZURICH, Switzerland -- CS Holding, parent of Switzerland's
No. 3 commercial bank Credit Suisse, said it is holding talks
with No. 5 Bank Leu AG, with the aim of forging a link.
   The alliance would take the form of a new holding company
that would house Bank Leu, as well as two smaller banks
already controlled by the CS Holding group, Bank Hofmann and
Clariden Bank. The two smaller banks specialize in investment
management, while the 235-year-old Bank Leu is a large,
independent universal bank. All three would maintain their
names and identities.

   Analysts said CS Holding's announcement signals the onset
of the long-heralded concentration of the banking industry in
Switzerland. "CS Holding is paving the way," said Albert
Pauchard, vice president of economics and investment research
at Handels-Bank NatWest in Zurich.
   Shares of the new holding company would be swapped for
equities of Bank Leu, at a ratio to be set later, and CS
Holding would end up with a majority interest in the new
holding concern.
   If Bank Leu's board recommends acceptance of the offer at
a meeting set for May 10, and Leu shareholders approve, the
transaction could be completed around the end of June. Swiss
regulators are also expected to review the proposal.
   Bank Leu, which has assets of about 15 billion Swiss
francs ($10.01 billion), has faced takeover rumblings in the
past, and management has sought to align its share base in
stable and friendly blocks, so as to cool takeover interest.
   But Bank Leu Chairman Kurt Schiltknecht conceded at a news
conference, also attended by CS Holding Chairman Rainer E.
Gut, that Leu was surprised to learn of the size of CS
Holding's stake. "Let 100 flowers bloom," declared Mr. Gut,
borrowing a phrase from former Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung.
   Despite what market sources said could be some resistance
from long-standing Bank Leu shareholder families who want to
see the company remain independent, analysts speculated that
CS Holding must already have sufficient voting power in Leu
shares to ensure the proposed transaction succeeds.
   The announcement said the CS Holding group has built up a
"substantial shareholding in Bank Leu over the last two
years," but the size of the stake wasn't disclosed. Assuming
that CS Holding controls at least half of the voting shares
of Leu, analysts estimated that the value of the stake could
be between 700 million and one billion Swiss francs.
   Rumors of such a linkup circulated a year ago, but both
companies had downplayed the talk. At that time, analysts
expressed skepticism about the benefits of such a linkup for
the CS Holding group, given Bank Leu's weak market position
and management problems.
   In 1988, analysts were equally doubtful about a proposed
common holding company between Leu and BZ Bank Zurich, a
small upstart that was viewed as trying to bite off more than
it could chew. The negotiations on that idea fell apart amid
criticism.
   Now, however, analysts are somewhat more positive, saying
Bank Leu's new strategy focusing on tailored products and
services for customers will reinforce the bank's potential to
develop its private client base.
   In the view of some analysts, Leu, which in recent years
has undergone a management shake-up and a corporate
restructuring, would have a better future with the CS Holding
tie.
   "Leu is weak in management, but has a strong potential,"
said Mr. Pauchard.
   Bank Leu's past internal turmoil, as well as some
strategic miscues and ill-conceived business transactions,
cost the bank precious time in adjusting to the rapidly
changing European banking scene, analysts have said.
   "It takes time to make that up," said Mr. Pauchard.
   Some stock analysts have contended that Bank Leu is about
midway through its refocusing program.
   In the announcement, CS Holding and Bank Leu noted that
the proposed alliance, including the two smaller private
banks, would "create broad-based synergy effects and enable
the group to develop its position in national and
international investment management business for private and
institutional clients."
   Precisely in that sector, analysts said, lies enormous
potential.
