   NEW YORK -- Earth Day is around the corner. But several
top executives in the business of pollution control and
environmental cleanup are selling some of the holdings in
their own companies.
   In the past three months, three insiders at International
Technology Corp. sold a total of about $4.3 million of its
stock, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The chairman of a Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.
unit trimmed his stake 59%. At Harding Associates Inc., four
high-level insiders have sold sizable chunks of stock. And a
director of Allwaste Inc. sold all his shares -- among other
insider sales in the industry.

   The selling is somewhat surprising because Wall Street is
bullish on environmental-services companies. And the stocks
as a group were good performers for most of last year. But
environmental-services shares were battered in late 1989 in
heavy tax-related selling, and most of the stocks haven't
fully recovered.
   Should investors be selling, too?
   Analysts, and the numbers, suggest that investors
shouldn't bail out yet. At three of the four companies, the
insiders who sold missed recent price run-ups in their
stocks. But the same analysts caution that investors should
realize that environmental-services stocks have turned out to
be more volatile -- and less of the straightforward play on a
clean environment -- than investors might expect.
   The stock of Browning-Ferris, for example, one of the
industry's leaders, has been "in turmoil," said Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons analyst Stephen Schweitch. On March 15,
Browning-Ferris's stock fell 5% on news that it had been
fined by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation and had been denied a permit to expand its
hazardous-waste landfill at Niagara Falls. The stock later
bounced back when Browning-Ferris announced it was getting
out of the landfill business.
   Similarly, some of the smaller enviromental-services
concerns have had problems stemming from their own success,
"problems with managing their growth," said Mr. Schweitch.
"They end up with more overhead, and margins and earnings
suffer." Nonetheless, he said, the outlook for the business
is "very good."
   At Browning-Ferris, Bruce Hendrickson, chairman of the
company's American Ref-Fuel joint venture (not the unit that
was fined), sold 47,878 shares on Feb. 27 for $1.7 million.
The shares represented 59% of his stake in the Houston-based
waste-management concern, according to SEC filings.
   The sales were "not related to Browning-Ferris at all,"
Mr. Hendrickson said in an interview. "I was in the process
of buying a ranch," he said, "and making some other
investments."
   The firm's general counsel also sold 3,000 shares on Feb.
5. He retains 12,667 shares, SEC filings show. The two
insiders sold at $35.55 and $35.75 a share, respectively. The
stock closed yesterday at $37.875, unchanged, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Murray Hutchison, chairman of International Technology,
said he sold 250,000 of its shares for $1.5 million to repay
a bank loan. In addition, his brother, director John H.
Hutchison, and director Bernard L. Simonsen sold sizable
blocks of stock in the Torrance, Calif.-based
pollution-control technology company. Their sales took place
from Feb. 22 through March 30.
   The chairman retains about 1.8 million shares. John
Hutchison sold 300,000 shares, or 14% of his holdings, for
$1.8 million. Mr. Simonsen sold 151,206 shares, 18% of his
holdings, for $1 million.
   The company's "doing fine," said the chairman. The
"backlog of work is growing, and we have a good position in
the market."
   The International Technology insiders sold for an average
of about $6.30 a share. But the stock has since risen in New
York Stock Exchange trading, closing yesterday at $7.625, up
25 cents.
   Four insiders at Harding Associates have sold shares in
the company this year. Richard Harding, its chairman,
launched the selling on Jan. 16 with a sale of 5,000 shares,
14% of his holdings, for $84,250. Richard Prezio, its
president, sold 6,000 shares, or 42% of his holdings, in two
sales later in January. In February, a senior vice president
sold 4,000 shares, 29% of his stake.
   Mr. Prezio and Mr. Harding were out of the office, but
Patricia England, Harding's corporate secretary, said two of
the insiders sold for tax purposes, and Mr. Harding sells
regularly.
   The largest sale was by Donald Schreuder, senior vice
president of operations at the Novato, Calif.-based
engineering and consulting firm. He sold 40,000 shares at an
average share price of $16.88, or about $675,100. Mr.
Schreuder retains 103,977 shares. The shares were sold to
"get a little liquidity, upgrade my standard of living and
(take care) of the education of my kids," he said.
   All the insiders received between $16.25 and $17.25 a
share. The stock has since risen, closing yesterday at
$19.25, unchanged, in over-the-counter trading.
   At Allwaste of Houston, director Carl E. Warden sold all
of his 29,000 shares on Jan. 19 and Jan. 22, SEC filings
show. His average sale price was $9.75, for a total of
$282,750. He remains with Allwaste and holds options on
another 120,000 shares, according to the company.
   Ronald Stanfa, a vice president of Allwaste, trimmed his
holdings by 4,700 shares. The sale leaves him a stake of
212,500 shares, SEC filings show. He sold his shares for
$9.38 each.
   Neither Mr. Stanfa or Mr. Warden could be reached for
comment. The stock closed yesterday at $9, down 12 1/2 cents,
in over-the-counter trading.

   BROWNING-FERRIS INDUSTRIES Inc. is pulling out of the
hazardous waste treatment and disposal business and is
closing or attempting to sell its hazardous-waste landfills.
An earlier edition reported that the company was leaving the
landfill business entirely. Browning-Ferris continues to
operate solid-waste landfills.
