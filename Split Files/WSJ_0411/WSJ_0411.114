   Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, said it agreed to acquire

   Mellon will also provide the network line between
AmeriTrust's ASSET network and the InstaNet shared regional
network. AmeriTrust will continue to operate the 270 ATM
ASSET network.
   The InstaNet network has 441 ATMs in the Cleveland area,
with about eight million transactions a year.
   AmeriTrust, a bank holding company based in Cleveland,
said the company decided to leave the ATM processing business
to concentrate on its retail business.
   Mellon, a bank holding company, has been expanding its ATM
processing business. Last month, it acquired the New England
ATM transaction processing business from State Street Bank &amp;
Trust Co.
