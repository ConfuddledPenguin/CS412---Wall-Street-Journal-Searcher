   NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's biggest
brokerage firm, is tightening its grip on how it credits
investors' securities proceeds in a move that could save the
firm millions of dollars that had previously gone to
customers.
   The move brings Merrill in line with the practices of
several other major brokerage firms, but has nevertheless
triggered complaints from Merrill brokers, some of whom
feared they may lose business as a result. The brokers claim
the change will deprive some customers of a fraction of the
interest income that they currently enjoy in their Cash
Management Accounts.

   There are 1.5 million such accounts at Merrill totaling
$160 billion in assets, the biggest such pool of cash and
securities by far of any U.S. brokerage firm.
   Under the change, outlined in an internal Merrill memo and
confirmed by the firm's officials, proceeds from sales of
securities that a client wants deposited in his or her
account will be credited the first business day following the
settlement of the trade -- rather than on the same day, as is
done now.
   If a trade settles on a Friday, the proceeds won't be
credited to a client's account until Monday -- depriving the
client of three days of interest income he would previously
have enjoyed, some brokers complain.
   Merrill officials say the change will save them a
substantial amount of money, but wouldn't estimate how much.
However, they say the change won't cost customers a
noticeable amount. A customer who sells 100 shares at $25 a
share, for example, might lose only one day's interest of 50
cents.
   Still, pennies add up, even for small investors. And
Merrill competitors, especially discount brokers, are likely
to try to make hay of the marketing change. Discount firm
Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc., for example, says it will continue
to pay clients on the settlement date. "People are entitled
to their money on the settlement date, not the day after,"
said President Leslie C. Quick III.
   Merrill, which has been laying off thousands of employees
and looking for other ways to cut costs, won't estimate
exactly how much it might save with the change. But the
savings will be substantial for the firm, which last year
reported its first unprofitable year as a public company
after taking a $470 million restructuring charge.
   "It's obviously worth a chunk of change to Merrill," said
money-fund expert William E. Donoghue, publisher of
Donoghue's Moneyletter, a newsletter on mutual funds. "The
more you trade, the more it costs you; and the larger the
trades, the more it costs you."
   Merrill officials say they have received many complaints
from among the firm's 12,000 brokers. But they say some of
the brokers are simply "confused" about the scope of the
changes.
   Merrill officials say the firm is simply catching up with
the practice at other major Wall Street securities firms,
including Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the nation's second
largest.
   Until now, Merrill officials explain, clients have been
enjoying interest that wasn't necessarily theirs. Merrill has
lost money by crediting its customers before Merrill itself
receives the proceeds of stock sales, according to Merrill
officials.
   "We're giving them interest from Day One, and very often
it takes us two to three days to get paid," said Patrick J.
Walsh, Merrill's director of asset-accumulation services
responsible for Cash Management Accounts marketing.
   "Something like this is just a minor change in the overall
scheme of all the things CMA can do for a client," he said.
For example, said Mr. Walsh, the Merrill accounts typically
pay interest on cash kept there at a rate two percentage
points above bank money-market fund accounts.
   Merrill's Cash Management Account, which the firm
pioneered, combines a securities account with check-writing
and credit-card privileges. Many Merrill investors put the
proceeds of securities sales into the money-fund part of the
account.
   Mr. Walsh also emphasized that the change applies only to
securities sales in which the proceeds are put back into the
Merrill account -- not to deposits into CMA accounts.
   Separately, in another development that reflects Wall
Street's increased focus on cost-cutting with customers,
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is considering a substantial
increase in "inactive" fees that it charges to accounts that
don't trade frequently.
   The firm, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
is considering charging as much as $175 to any client who
doesn't make at least one trade during a one-year-period, up
from the current $30 charge. The possible change, first
reported in the industry publication Wall Street Letter,
would be sharply higher than the $50 inactive fees that have
been adopted by several other major securities firms in
recent months.
   A Prudential-Bache spokeswoman yesterday said the firm is
"looking at a number of different options," but declined to
comment further. Prudential-Bache had a loss of $51 million
last year.
