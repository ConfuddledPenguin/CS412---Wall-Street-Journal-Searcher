   SHREVEPORT, La. -- Arkla Exploration said it tested a new
natural-gas and oil-discovery well, its third successful rank
wildcat in the Mississippi-Louisiana region this year and its
10th there since 1987. The Neyland Heirs No.1 well, in Amite
County, Miss., just north of the Louisiana line, flowed at
the rate of 360 barrels of oil and 458,000 cubic feet of
natural gas a day through a 10/64-inch opening. It was
completed at depths between 12,041 and 12,051 feet in the
Lower Tuscaloosa formation.
