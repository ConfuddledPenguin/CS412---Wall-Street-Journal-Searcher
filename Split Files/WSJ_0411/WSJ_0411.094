   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South African new vehicle
sales in March declined 5.0%, to 30,577 units, from 32,183
units a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers said.
   March sales were 9.8% higher than the 27,860 units sold in
February, the association said.

   NAAMSA's director, Nico Vermeulen, said seasonal factors
and a slightly improved manufacturers' supply position had
contributed to a modest improvement in new car and light
commercial-vehicle sales. However, he added that official
measures to cool off the economy continued to have a negative
impact on new car sales, and current difficult market
conditions were expected to persist into the second half of
1990. But sales of new motor vehicles were expected to
improve gradually, provided interest rates declined during
the latter part of the year.
   March sales of passenger vehicles of 19,043 units were
7.0% lower than the 20,477 units sold a year earlier, but
13.4% higher than February sales of 16,799 units.
   Commercial-vehicle sales for March totaled 11,534 units,
1.5% higher than 11,706 units sold a year earlier and 4.3% up
from February's 11,061 units.
   Vehicle sales for the first three months of the year
totaled 84,872 units, down 1.7% from 86,348 units sold in the
same period of 1989.
