   SunTrust Banks Inc.'s first-quarter earnings rose to 69
cents a share, or $87.9 million, despite continued growth in
its problem assets.
   The regional banking concern's first-quarter profit, which
was in line with most analysts' expectations, compares with
the year-earlier $84 million, or 65 cents a share.

   Atlanta-based SunTrust, beset by further loan problems in
Tennessee and mounting real-estate concern in Florida and
Georgia, charged off $29.3 million in bad loans, a 51% jump
from the $19.4 million charged off in the 1989 first quarter.
   In addition to the charge-offs, the $31 billion-asset
company increased its reserve for possible loan losses to
$351 million in the period from $342.3 million at year-end
1989. The increase relects a 19% rise in nonperforming
assets, which includes $323.8 million in problem loans, to
$415.4 million during the latest quarter from $350.4 million
at the end of 1989.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
SunTrust closed at $21.75, up 50 cents.
