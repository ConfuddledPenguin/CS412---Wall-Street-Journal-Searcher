   AMERICAN HEALTH SERVICES Corp. (Newport Beach, Calif.) --
Sandra E. Stiles, Joseph A. Boystak, and Roger Kimmel, all
designees of OmniCorp Holdings Inc., were elected to the
board of this operator of diagnostic-imaging centers.
American Health agreed to the three designees as part of
OmniCorp's $7 million infusion to American Health in exchange
for 29% of American Health's stock. American Health says the
OmniCorp designees don't plan any real changes in the way the
company is operated or its goals. OmniCorp is a unit of Omni
Holding AG, a Swiss financial and industrial-services
concern. The designees fill three of four vacancies left on
the seven-member board by the resignation of Gerald Shefsky,
Herman Becker-Fluegel, Garry W. Bond and David H. Brown. The
company said it will fill the fourth vacancy within the next
few months. American Health also said that S. Lewis Meyer,
president and chief executive officer, was named to the
additional post of chairman, succeeding Mr. Shefsky, who
resigned a month ago.
