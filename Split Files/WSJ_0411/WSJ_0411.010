   LILLO, Belgium -- The baseball season has finally begun in
the U.S. In France, the hallowed traditions of bicycle racing
are being repeated once again. And in this Flemish village,
there's goose-riding.
   For the uninitiated: Goose-riding, or gansrijden, doesn't
involve riding a goose. The goose is in no condition to be
ridden. For one thing, it's dead. For another, it's enmeshed
in a net and hangs by its feet from a wooden gallows.

   The players ride on horseback underneath the gallows and
try to yank the goose's head off. "Needless to say," reports
a news release from the Antwerp City Tourist Office, "this
causes general hilarity."
   Goose-riding, depicted in paintings dating as far back as
the 16th century, was revived in the 1920s and recurs each
spring in five towns and villages near the mouth of the
Schelde River, northwest of Antwerp.
   Of course, a few of the ancient traditions have been lost
over the years. For instance, the sportsmen no longer use a
live goose. Instead, the star of the show is slaughtered
humanely the night before.
   On a cold afternoon, the goose is strung up at 3 o'clock
sharp as several hundred spectators jostle with the 43-strong
permanent population of Lillo. A ragtag band, in the
blue-and-gold colors of Lillo's True Goose club, plays a
boisterous repertoire that includes "Deep in the Heart of
Texas."
   The competitors are 23 men, all wearing red war paint on
their faces, some on horseback for the first time. One by
one, the horses trot under the gallows. Some riders manage to
give the goose's head a good yank as they pass below. Some
are so intent on staying in the saddle that they miss the
target altogether.
   From time to time, the more daring riders stagily fall off
their horses in order to receive the customary shot of gin
from a clownish medical squad. Later, a few riders fall off
without trying. Two are taken to the hospital.
   Finally -- after 3 1/2 hours and 34 passes by each rider
-- Luc van Weutswinckel, a 28-year-old gardener and
chauffeur, pulls the head free, leaving the rest of the goose
swinging in a state best left undescribed.
   Afterward, in a barnlike tavern near the horse track, Mr.
van Weutswinckel presides over the jollity with a beer in one
hand and the goose's head clutched firmly in the other. How
does it feel to win the big one at Lillo? "Unbelievable," he
says.
