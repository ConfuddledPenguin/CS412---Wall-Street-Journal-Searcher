   Washington Bancorp. reported a first-quarter loss of $5.7
million, or 80 cents a share. The loss prompted an investor
group that has agreed to buy the company to demand a lower
price.
   A year ago, the bank holding company had net of $3.6
million, or 50 cents a share.

   WBC Acquistion Corp., which agreed in March to purchase
the company for $19.20 a share, said it remains interested,
but that the agreed-upon price is "no longer realistic." Both
companies said discussions are continuing.
   Washington Bancorp. said the $5.7 million loss included
special charges of about $5.5 million.
   In addition, the company added $3 million to loan-loss
reserves, compared with a $1.8 million addition a year ago.
Reserves totaled $40.4 million, compared with $45.7 million a
year ago.
   At the end of the quarter, the company's nonperforming
loans totaled $101.3 million, from about $60 million at year
end.
