   You've heard about the budget crisis in New York State.
This is what it has come to: The AP reports that a retired
postal worker outbid four banks to loan Genesee County
$110,000 for one year at 5.82%. There may be a financing
innovation in there somewhere, but insofar as taxes are going
up in many states, we suppose someone will see this as one
way to make government pay part of the tax bill.
