   WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. said its chairman
and chief executive officer, William McGowan, successfully
underwent exploratory chest surgery that was "completely
unrelated" to his 1987 heart transplant operation.
   The company said the surgery was performed at
Presbyterian-University Hospital of Pittsburgh, the same
hospital where Mr. McGowan had his heart transplant nearly
three years ago. Yesterday's surgery was performed by Dr.
Bartley Griffith, a cardiothoracic surgeon, who suggested the
operation following a periodic examination of Mr. McGowan.
Neither the hospital nor MCI disclosed the purpose of the
surgery.

   Mr. McGowan, who is expected to remain hospitalized for
five to seven days, was in surgery for two hours yesterday
morning, an MCI spokeswoman said. A hospital spokesman said
Mr. McGowan was in fair condition yesterday afternoon, and
had returned to his own room about an hour after surgery. The
spokesman said family members indicated the MCI chairman will
make a statement today.
