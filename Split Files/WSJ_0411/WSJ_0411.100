   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said it signed a
definitive agreement to sell its asset-based lending
subsidiary, New England Commercial Finance Corp., to National
Bank of Canada.
   Included in the sale are about $665 million in assets,
which were sold at a premium, Bank of New England said. The
amount of the premium -- the difference between the sales
price and the assets' book value -- wasn't disclosed.

   National Bank said the assets represent loans to about 125
borrowers. It said that less than 5% of the assets included
are loans for leveraged transactions and that none are
real-estate loans.
   The sale, expected to close by the end of April, is part
of Bank of New England's previously announced asset-sales
program. Proceeds of the sales are being used to reduce the
company's liquidity problems and to improve its capital
ratios.
   National Bank of Canada, based in Montreal, has assets of
35.9 billion Canadian dollars (US$30.9 billion). Bank of New
England has assets of about $25 billion.
