   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The Central Bank announced that it will
appropriate a part of Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to
refinance Taiwanese businesses that plan to invest or seek
mergers and acquisitions overseas.
   The move is aimed at using Taiwan's approximately $73
billion in local foreign exchange reserves to expand Taiwan's
economic base and stimulate further development, Yu Chen, the
Central Bank's deputy governor, said at a news conference. He
said the move might trigger short-term capital outflow, but
in the longer term, earnings from overseas investment are
likely to extend Taiwan's economic strength.

   Those eligible for the loans include companies involved in
natural resource development, high technology, anti-pollution
technology, and management training, he said. The Bank of
Communications, Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China,
International Commercial Bank of China and the China
Development Corp. are the four banks designated to issue the
loans.
