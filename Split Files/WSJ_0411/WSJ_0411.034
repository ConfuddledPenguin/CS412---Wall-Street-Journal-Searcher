   TOKYO -- Two members of the powerful Mitsubishi industrial
group, Mitsubishi Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement
Co., announced they would reunite in December.
   The two companies had been formed when Mitsubishi Mining
was broken up during the U.S. occupation of Japan after World
War II. Officials, announcing the merging of the two
companies, attempted to head off expected criticism that the
move is a step toward re-establishment of the monopoly power
held by Japan's prewar "zaibatsu" financial combines. The
Mitsubishi Group comprised one of the three most powerful
zaibatsu before and during the war.

   The new company, which will be named in May, will be
Japan's largest producer of nonferrous metals. On its own,
Mitsubishi Metal ranks as Japan's leading producer of
aluminum cans and is second in the production of silicon
wafers for semiconductors. Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement is a
leading producer of building materials.
   The presidents of the two companies said the merger
shouldn't be seen as a monopolistic threat. "We're two
companies in the same group that are merging," said
Mitsubishi Metal President Takeshi Nagano, who will be
chairman of the new company. "We aren't taking in others from
outside the group to get bigger."
   Masaya Fujimura, president of Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement,
who will be president of the new company, said the merger
also isn't aimed at strengthening ties within the Mitsubishi
family, which is already known for its strong intragroup
links. Instead, the companies said the merger would help
protect against international currency fluctuations to which
the metals business is vulnerable. And as both companies
strive to diversify into new areas of business, their joint
research capabilities will be strengthened, they said.
   The merger comes as the 160-company Mitsubishi Group is
restructuring in an attempt to become more globally
competitive. For example, Mitsubishi Corp., the trading house
that is one of the group's four core companies, this year
jumped into the international acquisitions fray with a bid
for Aristech Chemical Corp. of Pittsburgh. In March, the
Mitsubishi Group announced exploratory discussions on a range
of ties with West German conglomerate Daimler-Benz AG.
   The merger also comes at a time when the U.S. is examining
business practices that may hamper foreign access to the
Japanese market. In the current "structural impediments"
talks, the U.S. argues that Japan's industrial groups, known
as "keiretsu", effectively work to keep out foreign firms.
   Mr. Nagano tried to calm fears about how the combined firm
would operate in the U.S, where both companies have
operations. "I don't think the U.S. will feel more threatened
about our work after the merger," Mr. Nagano said.
   But analysts said that in a few years, the merged company
may want to expand in the U.S., especially to produce cement.
"We may actually see a day when {the Mitsubishi Group}
transfers its raw-material operations overseas," said Mark
Brown, a construction analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities (Japan) Ltd.
   The two companies are considered second-tier members of
the Mitsubishi Group, whose leading companies are Mitsubishi
Corp., the trading house, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
   Analysts said the merger makes sense because the two
companies are diversifying in similar directions. As Japan's
mining industry all but died with the upward valuation of the
yen since 1985, Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement was forced to move
out of mining and into developing new building materials and
advanced ceramics. The company closed its last coal mine last
month, marking the end of the company's 120-year coal-mining
business.
   Mitsubishi Metal, which concentrates on nonferrous metals,
has also been moving into new products such as processed
metals and electronics materials. Both companies also have
been examining real-estate development projects.
   "Rather than compete against each other," says Ken
Maruyama, a senior analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
International Ltd., "this merger is the best way to expand
business."
   The companies said this would be a fairly equal merger,
with nine shares of Mitsubishi Metal equaling 10 shares of
Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement. Annual sales of the new company
are expected to reach the equivalent of $5.7 billion in the
first year, and $6.4 billion within five years. The new
company, with total assets of $5.1 billion, will employ about
9,000 people.
