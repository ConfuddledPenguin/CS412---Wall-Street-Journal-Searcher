   NEW YORK -- Does Ennis Business Forms resemble a
fast-moving sports car or an old jalopy that's running out of
gas? It depends on whether you're looking at profit or at
sales.
   In terms of profitability, few can hold a candle to the
Ennis, Texas, company, which sells business forms mostly to
small concerns in rural areas and towns. Its return on equity
has been more than 30% in recent years. Per-share earnings
have been growing at 20% a year.

   But sales growth has been pokey. For the five years
through 1989, sales grew only about 4% a year. In fiscal
1990, which ended Feb. 28, analysts estimate sales were about
$140 million, compared with $108 million way back in fiscal
1984.
   The slow sales growth doesn't bother enthusiasts, who have
bid Ennis stock up to a market value of about $317 million,
some 2.3 times sales and more than 15 times earnings. Fredric
E. Russell, a Tulsa, Okla., money manager, has about 7% of
his portfolio in Ennis, owning close to 1% of the company. He
admires the company's skill in expanding earnings, thinks its
large network of close to 30,000 dealers is underappreciated
by Wall Street and expects Ennis to benefit from lower paper
prices this year.
   Another big Ennis fan is money manager Charles Allmon, who
has owned the stock for years in managed accounts and now
holds Ennis shares valued at around $4 million in Growth
Stock Outlook Trust, a closed-end fund he manages. Ennis "is
a classy operator. We've never sold a share," Mr. Allmon
says. "They have a great balance sheet, great return on
equity and they are buying back shares, which I always like
to see. Ennis is going to grow in good times and bad."
   Indeed, share buy-backs have been a support for Ennis's
stock, which closed yesterday at 24. Early last year the
board authorized Ennis to spend $5 million to buy back stock;
when that was done, directors in December authorized $10
million more.
   What about that slow sales growth? "With a return of 35%
on equity, they don't have to grow that fast," Mr. Allmon
says. "They're not a hot-shot outfit trying to grow at 15-20%
a year. They keep on growing at a steady pace."
   Others are less sanguine. Marty McDevitt, analyst with
Cleary, Gull, Reiland, McDevitt &amp; Collopy in Milwaukee, gives
Ennis a weak buy ("accumulate") rating, but gives stronger
buy ratings to competitors Wallace Business Forms, Standard
Register and Duplex Products.
   David Henwood, director of research at Raymond James &amp;
Associates, says Ennis has "the worst revenue growth in the
industry." As a result, he says, "I don't think (future)
earnings growth or dividend growth will be anywhere near as
fast" as past growth was. "I certainly wouldn't recommend
it."
   In some ways, Ennis is like the Boston Celtics, who are
often criticized as too old and too slow, but somehow manage
to perform well at playoff time. The slow growth "does worry
me," says one money manager who owns the stock. "But Ennis
has had problems with slow sales growth for several years
now, and it still keeps bringing earnings down to the bottom
line."
   Kenneth A. McCrady, Ennis's chairman and chief executive
officer, says, "I assure you that no one is more concerned
than I am about our recent inability to grow sales. We
absolutely realize that we cannot continue to grow earnings
at a faster rate than sales."
   In the past few months, he says, Ennis has revised its
incentive plans so that both dealers and plant managers are
compensated partly based on sales growth. (Ennis's dealers
are all independents, mainly printing shops, independent
business-forms dealers and stationery stores.)
   In another move to expand volume, Mr. McCrady says, Ennis
will experiment with "advertising specialties" such as mugs,
T-shirts and other items small businesses can use to
publicize themselves. Ennis won't manufacture these, but will
buy them from others and use its extensive distribution
network to sell them.
   "We have no illusions that we can grow sales 20% a year,
as we've grown earnings-per-share over the past five years,"
Mr. McCrady says. And he doesn't think profit margins can be
pushed much higher: They're already nearly 23% pretax and
more than 14% after-tax. Accordingly, "It's unlikely that we
will continue to experience that kind of earnings growth."
Nevertheless, he says he thinks Ennis, partly by improving
sales, can maintain its unusually high profitability, with a
return on equity of 30% or more.
