   Eastern Airlines' unsecured creditors asked a bankruptcy
court to oust the carrier's management and appoint a trustee
to run it.
   While their request had been expected, the forcefulness
with which they made it was not. In papers filed in New York
yesterday, the unsecured creditors lambasted Eastern and its
parent, Texas Air Corp., saying a trustee should be appointed
because "Eastern and Texas Air have proven that they are
unable to accurately project, even for short periods of time,
the likely results of operations."

   During the 13-month-long bankruptcy-law case, Eastern has
presented five different repayment plans to its creditors,
each offering to pay creditors less than the last. In their
filing, the unsecured creditors said they "will no longer
tolerate Eastern's and Texas Air's inability to adhere to an
agreement once reached. The history of this case convinces
the committee that even if a new plan was negotiated, Texas
Air and Eastern would again find a basis to renege."
   Separately yesterday, Eastern's pilots union won a victory
against the carrier, when a federal judge threw out two
bankruptcy-court rulings that had prevented the union from
challenging alleged violations of labor contracts. But the
decisions won't have any impact on Eastern's reorganization
struggle. The stakes in one dispute are pilot seniority
rights, in the other certain aircraft leases.
   Last week, the unsecured creditors threatened to seek a
trustee after rejecting Eastern's last, scaled-down repayment
offer. In following-through in such strong terms yesterday,
they enhanced the chances of a scramble for control of the
carrier in coming weeks.
   Eastern's equally alienated preferred shareholders are
already asking the court to take Eastern away from Texas Air
and give it to them, the unsecured creditors and a group of
new managers. And later this week, Eastern is expected to
widen the split by unilaterally filing its own new plan for
paying off its debts and emerging from proceedings under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Until now, the
parties had tried to negotiate one plan.
   The unsecured creditors are among the most powerful
players in Eastern's case. Their past opposition to efforts
by Eastern's unions to have a trustee appointed effectively
killed the request. Now, by asking for one themselves, they
are likely to have a powerful influence on the deliberations
of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who must
ultimately decide what to do.
   The group specifically asked for a trustee to run the
airline's day-to-day operations and help oversee the pending
sale of Eastern's Latin American routes to AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines for $349 million. The committee also wants
the trustee to seek a buyer for Eastern or to somehow enhance
its value.
   Texas Air and Eastern will certainly oppose the creditors'
bid for a trustee. A spokesman for Texas Air yesterday
attacked their request as "an almost hysterical, highly
one-sided, dramatized document, designed to support the
previously announced negotiating posture of the unsecured
creditors. It totally ignores the historical, continuing and
proposed support by Texas Air and {its Continental unit} of
Eastern's recovery."
   The falling-out between Eastern and its creditors began
last month, after Texas Air said it couldn't live up to a
commitment to pay them about 50 cents for every dollar owed.
Negotiations collapsed after Eastern proposed a 25-cent
repayment instead, and Texas Air refused to underwrite as
much of Eastern's estimated losses as creditors demanded.
   As for the pilots union victory, U.S. District Judge
Robert Sweet in Manhattan vacated a bankruptcy-court decision
that had prohibited the union from forcing Eastern into
arbitration. Judge Sweet also lifted a bankruptcy-court
injunction that had prevented the union from suing Eastern in
federal court in Florida for alleged violations of the
union's collective-bargaining agreement with the company.
   In a ruling filed yesterday, Judge Sweet said Judge
Lifland had given Eastern too much leeway in breaking its
labor contract.
   Judge Lifland had ruled that Chapter 11 gives debtors a
"breathing spell" from creditors' and labor's claims. But
Judge Sweet ruled that Judge Lifland's actions were barred by
the Bankruptcy Code. He said Congress had changed the
bankruptcy law in 1984 to avoid just such actions by
employers.
   An Eastern spokeswoman said the company is considering an
appeal.
   The decision gives the union a green light to seek
arbitration proceedings to determine whether Texas Air has
merged the operations of its Eastern and Continental Airlines
units. Texas Air says no merger has occurred. If an
arbitrator decides there has been a merger, it would trigger
so-called labor-protective provisions, including seniority
rights protecting Eastern pilots.
   Judge Sweet also cleared the way for the union's Florida
suit, in which it alleges that certain leasing agreements
that Eastern entered into with Continental Airlines violated
the collective-bargaining pact.
