   COUNTRYWIDE FUNDING Corp. -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. lowered its rating on commercial paper of this Pasadena,
Calif., mortgage banker to Not Prime from Prime-3. The rating
agency also confirmed its Ba-2 rating on medium-term notes of
the company's parent, Countrywide Credit Industries Inc.
About $200 million of long-term debt is affected. Moody's
said the action reflects "the ongoing consolidation of the
residential mortgage market and the potential effect of that
trend on the firm's business outlook." Moody's noted,
however, that Countrywide "has an experienced management as
well as an established, low-cost mortgage-banking network.
