   WASHINGTON -- Since 1955, the nation's dwindling number of
sheepherders have been paid nearly $2 billion in subsidies,
primarily to ensure the military a ready supply of wool in
case of war.
   Trouble is, wool hasn't been listed as a strategic
material since 1960. Nonetheless, one sheepherder alone --
the meatpacking giant Monfort Inc. -- has been collecting as
much as $478,000 a year in price-support payments for
shearing wool from lambs.

   To a growing number of lawmakers, such payments as these
exemplify the excesses of a national farm policy they believe
has gone dreadfully awry. Few members of Congress are more
unhappy with government farm programs than conservative
Republican Rep. Dick Armey of Texas and liberal Democratic
Rep. Charles Schumer of New York. Though political odd
fellows, they have begun building a political coalition in
the House to inject what Rep. Armey calls "perestroika" into
U.S. agriculture.
   The wool and mohair program, as they see it, ranks as one
of Washington's more pointless endeavors. Says Rep. Schumer:
"It's a subsidy in search of a rationale." And if they have
their way, it's a subsidy in danger of a heavy shearing.
   Quietly and steadily, Reps. Schumer and Armey have been
recruiting colleagues, tapping into bipartisan concern about
rising food prices and growing impatience with perceived
inequities and inefficiencies in the commodity programs. At
the same time, they are enlisting the support of consumer
advocates, who object to many farm-price supports as "hidden
taxes" on supermarket shoppers, and they are reaching out to
environmentalists, who fault the farm programs for rewarding
overuse of pesticides and other harmful farming practices.
   Once everybody is aboard, the coalition intends to weigh
in on the farm-bill debate, which has long been dominated by
the Agriculture Committee and a phalanx of lobbyists for
commodity groups. "The vast majority of my constituents are
buying their groceries at the grocery store, not tilling the
soil," says Mr. Armey, son of a North Dakota farmer. "The
farm bill {should} be debated by not only people on the
supply side of the market, but by people on the demand side
as well."
   Mr. Schumer, a Harvard-educated lawyer, and Mr. Armey, a
free-market economist, make a formidable pair. Both are
Budget Committee members, respected as inside players adept
at legislative accommodation. Mr. Armey has mellowed greatly
since his freshman days as a free-market firebrand. On the
farm front, he hopes to repeat his success in brokering an
agreement on closing military bases.
   The two men cast themselves as farm-program reformers, not
hit men. "We aren't trying to kill them," says Rep. Schumer.
"We're trying to fix them."
   Their timing seems right. For one thing, the Farm Belt has
recovered from the drought of 1988 and economic doldrums of
the mid-1980s. Equally important, adds Rep. Armey, "We have
gotten four or five years away from those emotional movies
{about farm foreclosures}."
   What's more, demographic trends are working in the
would-be reformers' favor. The strength of the farm bloc has
been waning as the rural population declined. Only 46 of 435
congressional districts are now truly agrarian, according to
an Agriculture Department study. At the same time, the
longstanding accommodations between rural members and
big-city members, who need rural votes for food stamps and
social programs, appear to be fraying of late.
   Says John White, former chairman of the Democratic
National Committee: "The reality is that there's a greater
possibility to change programs than ever before."
   Given federal budget constraints, squabbles among
commodity groups over their respective slices of a shrinking
subsidy pie may further weaken some of the old alliances. A
few cracks already are showing in the farm bloc.
   "A corn-state guy came up to me the other day and said the
peanut program is the worst," Mr. Armey says. "He tried to
point me off in that direction."
   He and Mr. Schumer are sounding out like-minded members of
the Senate about joining forces. But the chances of success
there aren't nearly as bright, if only because every member
respresents at least some farm interests. Ultimately,
everything may depend on how serious the Bush administration
is about holding down farm outlays and making agriculture
more market-oriented.
   The Bush administration, in sending Congress a bundle of
1990 farm-bill proposals, urged a $1.5 billion cutback in
commodity subsidies next year and singled out several
programs for overhauling. Two prime targets: wool-mohair and
peanuts. The price supports for both have been going up since
1985, while corn, wheat and other crops have been taking
cuts. The administration favors revamping both programs to
put wool-mohair and peanuts on a par with other crops.
   The peanut program is regarded by many as particularly
egregious. Because of its high price supports and tight lid
on peanut production and imports, American consumers have to
pay higher prices for U.S. peanuts than foreigners do.
   As for the wool and mohair program, it has been operating
in obscurity ever since Congress decided in 1954 that the
slide in U.S. wool production had to be halted, mainly
because the Pentagon needed woolen uniforms. A new General
Accounting Office report shows that wool production has
continued to plummet despite years of incentive payments to
sheepherders and ranchers. Last year, the government paid
$3.04 for each additional pound of wool produced, $1.66 more
than the average market price.
   "What's particularly galling," says Mr. Schumer, "is most
of them are raising sheep for meat purposes." A spokeman for
Monfort, a ConAgra Inc. subsidiary, says that Monfort shares
its wool payments -- in 1988, they totaled $425,000 -- with
ranchers who raise lambs for its slaughterhouses.
   The GAO report strongly questions the need for further
payments in an age of synthetic fibers, and reminds Congress
of a legislative lapse: It never decided why mohair
production should be subsidized at all, or why individual
Angora goat ranchers should be paid as much as $300,000 a
year in mohair subsidies. And in an unusual letter to
Congress, the agency lists numerous "opportunities for
change" in farm law, including elimination of wool-mohair
price supports.
   One of the coalition's legislative planks would outlaw
payments of any kind to farmers with incomes of $100,000 a
year or more. Says Rep. Armey: "There's no reason we should
be subsidizing individuals who earn more than three times the
average annual income of a family of four."
   The coalition won't make any concerted move until the 1990
farm bill reaches the House floor, probably early this
summer. In the meantime, the strategy is to have a bipartisan
team working on each commodity. New York Democratic Rep.
Thomas Downey and Ohio Republican Rep. Willis Gradison
already are pushing their bill to overhaul the sugar
price-support program.
   Says Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank: "Some of
the guys on the Agriculture Committee believe they face their
toughest year ever."
