   TORRANCE, Calif. -- The chief executive of Ashton-Tate
Corp., Edward Esber Jr., waxed enthusiastic about the
company's new dBASE IV computer program. He even said, at the
October 1988 press conference unveiling it, that delays in
completing the program had been helpful because they gave the
programmers time to ensure that it would meet "quality
standards" and would be "everything we'd said it would be."
   But there was a problem: Mr. Esber didn't know how to use
the new program. "Ed didn't use dBASE," says Roy Folk, then
head of Ashton-Tate's product development. "He couldn't just
load up dBASE IV and know its condition." Thus, Mr. Esber
didn't know that the program was marred by thousands of
errors.

   "This is his company's cash cow, and he can't even use
it," says Pat Adams, a New York consultant. "That's like Lee
Iacocca not being able to drive a car."
   No one else at Ashton-Tate recognized the product had so
many flaws, either. Within weeks, irate customers complained
that dBASE IV lacked important features and was too slow and
too likely to crash.
   To quiet critics, Mr. Esber promised a corrected version,
but some 18 months later it still hasn't appeared. Mr. Esber
now declines to say when it will.
   The episode is one of a remarkable string of major
mistakes. Ashton-Tate has botched three acquisitions and at
least two major product-development efforts. Mr. Esber named
a chief operating officer who irritated many members of the
staff and eventually left. Mr. Esber lost Ashton-Tate's key
engineer. And he irked Apple Computer Inc.'s chief, John
Sculley, who then turned over a data-base product and other
software designed by Apple to two new companies, now
Ashton-Tate rivals.
   The errors at Ashton-Tate have taken their toll. The
company was once one of personal computing's Big Three
software concerns, along with Microsoft Corp. and Lotus
Development Corp. Its flagship product, dBASE, drove the
acceptance of personal computers in the early 1980s by giving
users a flexible way of organizing and retrieving large
amounts of data. Yet today, many experts consider Ashton-Tate
among the software companies that have faded from leadership
to being also-rans.
   Mr. Esber remains optimistic about Ashton-Tate's future.
He insists that it remains "the dominant player" in PC data
bases and that he has sorted out its technical problems.
Although he still won't predict when the long-overdue
revision of dBASE IV will be shipped to customers, he says a
test version is good enough that some evaluators are "crying
out that we should release it." He adds: "We're alive and
well and putting out good products."
   Still, while Lotus and Microsoft grew rapidly during the
past two years, Ashton-Tate has posted losses for the past
three quarters. Its revenue has slumped to $62.1 million in
its fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31, from $87.3 million in the
quarter ended Jan. 31, 1989. Its share of the data-base
market fell from 62.5% in 1985 to 43% in 1989, according to
International Data Corp. And Ashton-Tate failed to exploit a
new approach to data bases that enabled Oracle Corp., a rival
only one-fourth Ashton-Tate's size in 1985, to become more
than three times as large as it is today.
   Simply fixing dBASE IV won't reverse Ashton-Tate's revenue
slump. "That's a Band-Aid," says Rick Sherlund, an analyst at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
   Ashton-Tate's decline shows how fleeting success can be
for high-tech firms, especially in software, if senior
management doesn't include people with the expertise to keep
up with innovation in the field. Mr. Esber is a marketing man
leading a company that has virtually no tradition of product
development. In his five years atop Ashton-Tate, he has
emphasized packaging over technical expertise. In contrast,
Jim Manzi, the chief of Lotus and another marketing man,
rescued his company from mediocrity by adding to his
management team Frank King, a technical ace from
International Business Machines Corp.
   "Every technology company needs a visionary who can
perceive the general direction of a market," says William
Davidow, a venture capitalist and writer on high-tech-company
management. "Without one, a company very quickly loses its
technology position."
   Nevertheless, things could be worse for Ashton-Tate. It
hasn't any debt, and it slashed expenses by laying off about
15% of its 1,700 workers last August. It still has the most
customers of any data-base producer, having sold more than
three million copies of its dBASE programs to date. With a
few breaks, the company could rebound, if not to its previous
glory, at least to consistent profitability.
   "If you asked me a few months ago if Ed could fix things,
I'd have said no," says Cary Prague, assistant director of
finance at Travelers Insurance, a member of an Esber advisory
group. "But I've seen significant progress lately. If dBASE
1.1 {the corrected version} comes out and it works, customers
aren't going to remember the problems."
   But many analysts believe that Ashton-Tate has squandered
its once-dominant position in data-base software. Although
the company chalked up a 30% annual growth rate in the five
years beginning in February 1984, Mr. Esber is widely viewed
as an executive who was in the right place at the right time.
His path to the top was paved by the sudden death of George
Tate, Ashton-Tate's chief executive, in August 1984. And
three months later, David Cole, Mr. Tate's second-in-command,
left for another company.
   In many ways, Mr. Esber, who joined Ashton-Tate less than
a year before as a marketing vice president, wasn't an
obvious candidate for the top job: Though trained as an
electrical engineer, he didn't write software applications,
and he had clashed with the management of his previous
employer, VisiCorp.
   But Ashton-Tate's board of directors gave him the job. "We
looked outside but decided Ed was the logical candidate,"
says Jill Weissman Tate, Mr. Tate's widow and a director.
   At first, the decision seemed wise. Mr. Esber, a Harvard
MBA who had worked at IBM, was strong on procedures and
marketing. He also kept close to the ranks and, in odd
contrast to his combative relations with other executives,
won a reputation for geniality among some employees.
   "We used to call him `the pussycat,'" says Mr. Folk, the
former product-development chief, who followed Mr. Esber to
Ashton-Tate from VisiCorp and now is at another software
company. Mr. Esber often relied on humor; he once came to a
staff meeting dressed as Gen. Patton.
   By mid-1986, Mr. Esber felt he needed help managing daily
operations because he was trying to transform Ashton-Tate
from a one-product data-base supplier into a software
supermarket. As the new chief operating officer, he chose
Luther Nussbaum, whose only experience in the PC industry was
as an operations executive with Businessland Inc., a computer
dealer.
   Although credited with expanding Ashton-Tate's European
operations, Mr. Nussbaum angered many people at Ashton-Tate
by belittling and refusing to listen to them. "My first
meeting with Luther went pretty badly," recalls Robert
Gafford, then the company's chief of customer service. "He
said, `I understand you're the best manager in the company.'
Naturally, I took that as a compliment, but he quickly added:
`I'm not impressed with you.'" Mr. Nussbaum declines to
comment.
   Mr. Esber offered little comfort to senior executives
chafing under Mr. Nussbaum's barbs. Instead, Mr. Esber
traveled frequently and "got caught up in the idea he was a
visionary," says Mr. Gafford, who left Ashton-Tate in 1987 to
head customer service for Claris Corp., Apple's software
unit.
   According to colleagues, Mr. Nussbaum seemed to have Mr.
Esber's wholehearted support. "We didn't feel we had to go to
Ed" for decisions, says David Micek, dBASE IV's product
manager. "If we got approval from {Mr. Nussbaum}, we went
ahead. Everyone knew he was boss." Mr. Esber won't comment
about Mr. Nussbaum.
   In the end, Mr. Nussbaum took the rap for Ashton-Tate's
problems, which included an embarrassing failure to handle
inventory properly. He quit last July.
   At the same time as Mr. Nussbaum was roiling Ashton-Tate
internally, Mr. Esber was overseeing a diversification plan
based on his view that software was essentially a packaging
business. "There was a feeling that all we had to do was slap
the Ashton-Tate name on products and they'd sell," says Ron
Posner, an Ashton-Tate alumnus who now heads Peter Norton
Computing Inc., a software maker.
   To expand the product line, Mr. Esber went shopping. In
1985, he spent $22 million on Multimate International Corp.,
which owned a popular word processor. But key Multimate
managers and engineers, whose knowledge of the product was
irreplaceable, soon left. For years, Multimate's sales
stagnated. Recently, it released its first substantially
improved version of the word processor -- after competing
products have become entrenched.
   Next, in 1986, Mr. Esber paid $12.9 million for Decision
Resources Inc., a maker of graphics software. Demand for
graphics software has exploded, but competitors had raced
past Decision Resources by the time Mr. Esber bought it.
Today, Ashton-Tate's graphics sales are only 1% of the
company's total revenue.
   And in February 1988, Mr. Esber bought into the burgeoning
market for Macintosh software. He thought he had acquired two
products, a word processor and a graphics package, that would
bring Ashton-Tate to prominence among Macintosh users. Today,
however, sales are weak, mainly because the products were
ill-conceived. The word-processing program, for instance,
requires twice the amount of costly computer memory as rival
programs.
   Defending his acquisitions, Mr. Esber says, "If there was
any mistake we made, it was in how we integrated those
companies." But critics say he couldn't measure the technical
worth of software products nor develop them once the managers
of the acquired companies left.
   Ironically, one acquisition that Mr. Esber failed to make
still haunts Ashton-Tate. In early 1987, he nearly bought Fox
Software Inc., a closely held data-base company. After months
of study, Ashton-Tate's engineers agreed that Fox's
technology could lay the basis for a new generation of
data-base products. But the deal fell through. "They could've
bought us for $10 million, but they chose to haggle us down,"
says David Fulton, Fox's president. "In the end, top
management bought into the idea that they didn't need us,
that they could push forward without us."
   In 1988, Mr. Esber sued Fox, alleging copyright
infringement because Fox sells a data-base program that
shares some features and the same computer language as
Ashton-Tate's dBASE. The case is pending in federal district
court in Los Angeles. Today, Fox is winning over many
Ashton-Tate customers.
   Mr. Esber's acquisitions might not have hurt Ashton-Tate
if it had produced a stream of new products. It hasn't. "Ed
views programmers with great disdain," says Ms. Adams, the
consultant. "He thinks these people are all interchangeable."
   Shortly after taking over as chief executive, Mr. Esber
clashed with Wayne Ratliff, then the company's guiding light
for data-base products. The feud simmered for years, then
erupted in early 1987 when Mr. Ratliff resigned in a blaze of
lawsuits and began writing software for a competitor.
   On the technical side, Mr. Ratliff was central to
Ashton-Tate's success. In the early 1980s, he oversaw the
design of the original dBASE in his spare time while working
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. He
tried to peddle the program on his own but failed. So he sold
it to Ashton-Tate, which renamed it dBASE II (because it
sounded high-tech and implied an improvement over a
nonexistent dBASE I). Ashton-Tate, which had never developed
a software product on its own, had one of the infant
PC-software industry's few runaway hits.
   Since then, Mr. Esber has hired a succession of top
engineers, but no one has really replaced Mr. Ratliff. Mr.
Esber hasn't filled permanently the job of heading the
critical data-base group. "Ed's got to find someone with
technical vision, and he hasn't done that," says Stewart
Alsop, the editor of PC Letter.
   Without this vision, Ashton-Tate's product-development
efforts have floundered. For example, dBASE 3 Plus, the
predecessor to dBASE IV, was initially felled by
manufacturing and possibly programming errors. Ashton-Tate
was forced to withdraw at least 24,000 copies of it shortly
after its introduction in January 1986. The mistake, though
quickly corrected, cost the company nearly $600,000.
   The company faced more problems with a version of dBASE
for Apple's Macintosh (dBASE had worked only on the IBM PC or
compatible computers). The program was revised so often that
Ashton-Tate printed three different user manuals -- and
destroyed the first two. In September 1987, the company
shipped the program, but sales have been weak.
   And finally, dBASE IV, the biggest project of Mr. Esber's
tenure, is so complex that it outstripped the company's
testing procedures and crashed on takeoff.
   Admittedly, the task was difficult. To fit the roughly
500,000 lines of code for dBASE IV (four times the size of
its predecessor) into the standard memory limitation of the
operating system requires ingenuity. "We have had a hard time
controlling" the code, says Harry K.T. Wong, a data-base
expert who joined the company in 1987. (He says Ashton-Tate
has solved this problem by chopping up the program into many
pieces, which are then swapped in and out of the PC's memory
as needed.)
   Ashton-Tate also missed a chance to exploit a new approach
to enabling a mix of different brands of computers to store
and retrieve data. Called Structured Query Language, it was
adopted by IBM and has spread throughout the computer
industry. Oracle has built a huge business around SQL
software, but Ashton-Tate still doesn't have a hookup to SQL
engines.
   The decline of Ashton-Tate has clearly mellowed Mr. Esber.
At a gathering of PC executives last September, he requested
advice from several competitors on how to improve
software-design practices. And he has asked major customers
to advise him on technical matters.
   To his credit, he isn't hiding from critics. Early this
year, he met with one customer calling for his removal and,
in April, appointed him to an advisory group. "I still think
Ed should go," says Michael Masterson, the customer and the
head of the largest dBASE user group in Silicon Valley. But
he adds lately that Mr. Esber is "doing more of the right
things."
   Ashton-Tate's board agrees. "If you look back over the
years, critics have counted us out in the past, but I'm
betting heavily" that Mr. Esber can revive the company, Mrs.
Tate says.
   Mr. Esber insists he can, but concedes that competition is
tougher than ever. Once king of the data base, Ashton-Tate,
he now says, lives in a world where "no one company is going
to lock up all the data repositories."
