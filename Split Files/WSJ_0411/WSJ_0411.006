   MONMOUTH JUNCTION, N.J. -- Rhone-Poulenc Inc. said it will
suspend the sale of its aldicarb pesticide in the U.S. for
use on potatoes because recent tests showed chemical residues
on a small number of potato samples.
   Rhone-Poulenc found the residues while doing a survey for
the the Environmental Protection Agency, whose chief interest
was possible ground-water contamination. An EPA spokesman
said that the residues were found on 10 of 2,600 potatoes
tested, and that all 10 came from one of 26 fields tested.

   Rhone-Poulenc said it found residues at "higher levels
than the company would expect from proper use" of aldicarb.
The company said farmers are beginning to plant this year's
potato crop, and it wanted to spare them "a needless and
damaging `food scare' of the type we've seen in the past."
   Aldicarb, sold by Rhone-Poulenc under the tradename Temik,
doesn't have any known long-term health effects. The company
said that during nearly 17 years of use of the product, it
has never had a report of anyone's becoming sick from eating
treated potatoes.
   The EPA spokesman said residues at the highest levels
found in the survey could conceivably cause transient
flu-like symptoms but shouldn't create any alarm about eating
potatoes. Although death due to direct ingestion of large
amounts aldicarb is possible, he emphasized that no deaths
have ever been associated with any treated foods.
   A Rhone-Poulenc spokesman said the company is still
talking with regulatory authorities in other large
potato-producing countries about how to proceed there. In the
U.S., he said, the company won't sell aldicarb for use on
potatoes throughout this planting season and possibly
throughout next year's as research into the residue levels
continues. The company will continue selling aldicarb, which
kills insects, mites and nematodes, for uses other than those
on potatoes.
   Rhone-Poulenc, the U.S. chemicals unit of Rhone-Poulenc
S.A., of Paris, didn't disclose its sales of aldicarb, but
the spokesman said cotton growers are a more important market
for the pesticide than potato growers. Among potato growers,
he said, the product has about 15% of the market.
