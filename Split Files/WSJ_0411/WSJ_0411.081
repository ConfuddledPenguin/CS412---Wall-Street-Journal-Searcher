   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Xerox Corp. said a shareholder filed a
civil lawsuit against members of its board.
   The suit, filed in Connecticut state court, asks that all
current and several past Xerox directors pay damages of more
than $400 million to the company for decisions they made
regarding Xerox's investments in VMS Realty Partners, a
Chicago real estate concern.

   The suit also asks that the directors indemnify and hold
Xerox harmless from any loss or judgment that might result
from other lawsuits related to the VMS investments. According
to Xerox's 1989 annual report, 12 such class-action suits
have been filed against the company in federal court.
   Xerox wouldn't comment on the suit.
   Xerox said last week that it will take a first-quarter
pretax write-off of about $400 million, essentially walking
away from its investment in VMS. In February, VMS said it had
ceased all but essential payments to creditors because of
cash-flow problems.
   The shareholder who filed the suit, William Steiner of
Great Neck, N.Y., said he had no comment about the action
"apart from the fact that it is justified. I really don't
want to try it in the papers."
