   . . . the bad news is that this is because by now, broad
liability rules mean no lawsuit is clearly frivolous.
Consider:

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP, April 4) -- A couple are suing a
hospital for $4 million, complaining staff members nicknamed
their baby "Smurfette" because her skin was accidentally dyed
blue.
   The suit claims Kirsten Madsen was "subjected to the
callous, distressing remarks . . . among which was the
reference to her just-delivered daughter as `Smurfette.'"
   Smurfette is a character in "The Smurfs" cartoon show. The
Smurfs are elflike creatures with blue skin.
   The suit says Mrs. Madsen was injected with blue dye in
her womb to test for a urinary tract infection 12 hours
before she went into labor at Baptist Hospital.
                                                                                                       

   Her lawyer thinks Mrs. Madsen is due a payout from the
hospital because, he argues, the Smurfette remarks caused
"extreme, distressing and permanent emotional damage,
humiliation and ridicule" to her and to her just-born
daughter. In other words, the Madsen family is about to take
a giant tug on the greatest Wheel of Fortune, the American
legal system. Where the wheel stops no one knows.
   As this case suggests, tort law has deteriorated so far
that no one can know if a case is absurd or serious. Even the
lawyers with the most at stake in understanding the law --
contingency-fee plaintiffs' lawyers -- must have to pinch
themselves sometimes to see if they're dreaming.
   One way plaintiffs' lawyers keep up with the unpredictable
legal system is with Lawyers Alert, a Boston-based
fortnightly, which has a feature called "What's the Verdict?
Test Your Knowledge of What Juries Are Awarding." This quiz
gives hypothetical facts, the likelihood that a jury will
find liability and the likely jury award. Case studies are
provided by courtwatchers at Jury Verdict Research Inc., who
analyze trends in liability and awards in various parts of
the country.
   Try your hand at legal soothsaying:
   -- Larry, a 62-year-old postal employee, fractured his
clavicle when he slipped and fell on the deck of a cruise
ship. He sued the owners of the cruise line for negligence,
on the grounds that a puddle had been allowed to form under
an air conditioning unit. Larry incurred $1,400 in medical
expenses, lost $2,000 in wages, and claimed to suffer
emotional distress because the injury ruined a vacation for
which he had planned and saved for many years. The cruise
line argued that (1) there was no puddle, but rather normal
dampness on the deck, (2) Larry was drunk at the time, (3)
Larry wasn't wearing appropriate footwear, and (4) passengers
had been warned that the deck would be slippery.
   The average jury will find for Larry 54% of the time. In
Peoria, Ill., Larry would expect an award of $20,000.
   -- Sam, a 20-year-old college student, was attacked and
beaten at a college fraternity party and suffered a fractured
jaw, rib fractures, a ruptured spleen and numerous contusions
and abrasions. Although he was certain that his attackers
were guests at the party, he was intoxicated at the time and
couldn't remember the specific individuals who assaulted him.
He sued the fraternity that sponsored the party, alleging
that it (1) allowed guests to drink to excess, (2) failed to
control the party when drunken guests started to make
trouble, and (3) negligently served him alcohol even though
he was underage, thus making him less able to defend himself
against his attackers.
   He also sued the college on whose property the party was
held, claiming that the college administrators had been aware
that the fraternity frequently held "wild" parties but failed
to take any action to stop or regulate them.
   The average jury will find for Sam 97% of the time. In
Bronx, New York, Sam would get $250,000.
   -- Willa, a 19-year-old hairdresser, was detained by
security personnel at a department store who claimed she had
put several items of jewelry in her purse and tried to leave
without paying for them. She was released and warned not to
return to the store, and later brought a claim for her mental
anguish and emotional distress arising from the incident. She
argued that she had put the jewelry in her open purse for a
moment because her hands were full, and that rather than
trying to leave the store, she was trying to find a sales
clerk when she was apprehended.
   Willa testified that she was interrogated for several
hours and was verbally abused and threatened, and became so
upset that she missed several days of work and sought
psychiatric help. She claimed $200 in lost earnings and $500
in psychiatric expenses. The defendants argued that they had
acted properly, and that Willa was exaggerating the extent of
her injuries.
   The average jury will find for Willa 53% of the time. In
Mobile, Ala., Willa would get $36,000.
   -- Rhonda, a 27-year-old fashion model, burned her scalp
and lost most of her hair when she used a home hair-coloring
product. She sued the manufacturer, alleging that the product
was dangerous and should not have been on the market, and
claiming damages for emotional distress and earnings she lost
because she wasn't able to work as a model with her hair in
such a condition. At trial, the manufacturer contended that
the product was not dangerous and that Rhonda apparently had
an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients, and that if
she had performed the patch test recommended in the product's
directions, she would have discovered that she had the
allergy and so avoided the injury.
   The average jury will find for Rhonda 89% of the time. In
New York City, Rhonda would get $41,000.
   Don't be surprised if you're surprised by these results.
Returning the law to more certainty and common sense will be
a long-term project. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher last
week backed a proposed bill to create a single, federal
standard for product liability.
   Three Republican congressmen from California are working
on a plan to slow the rate of liability-expanding litigation.
Reps. Christopher Cox, Dana Rohrabacher and Tom Campbell want
to deter wild lawsuits with a version of the "English rule"
on legal costs -- the loser of a lawsuit has to pay the
winner's lawyer and other costs. Many contingency-fee lawyers
now diversify their risk by taking a lot of dubious cases,
hoping that a few at the margin of the common law will strike
gold. The English rule would weed out the more absurd cases.
The congressmen want the rule to apply in federal litigation
and also plan to propose a ballot initiative to make the
reform in California as early as 1992.
   Reformers argue that only lawyers benefit from today's
bottomless liability, which raises consumer prices in every
industry. It will be interesting to see who will fight
proposals to discourage what we once called frivolous
lawsuits.

   If you thought...
                                                                                                       

   -- Sam and Rhonda would win: 5 pts. each
   -- Larry and Willa would win: 10 pts. each
   -- If you estimated the total award to the four plaintiffs
within $50,000: 15 pts.
                                                                                                       

   A sum of 25 points or more, and if you're not a lawyer you
should be.
