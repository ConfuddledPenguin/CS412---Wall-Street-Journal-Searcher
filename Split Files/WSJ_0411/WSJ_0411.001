   AKRON, Ohio -- Robert E. Newstat, convicted here on 16
criminal counts related to the collapse of Enduro Stainless
Inc., was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison by U.S.
District Judge David D. Dowd Jr.
   The judge also ordered Mr. Newstat, 56 years old, along
with co-defendant Lawrence D. Greenberg to pay a $1 million
fine and to pay back $1.7 million that the two men had
embezzled from Enduro in the months before it was forced to
seek bankruptcy court protection from creditors.

   A story detailing how Messrs. Newstat and Greenberg
siphoned off millions of dollars from Enduro and other
companies was featured on The Wall Street Journal's front
page March 15. The two Philadelphia men had acquired Enduro,
of Massillon, Ohio, from LTV Steel Co., a unit of LTV Corp.,
of Dallas. LTV Steel admitted that it was bilked of out
nearly $47 million in scams involving the two men.
   Mr. Newstat's attorney earlier said he planned to appeal
the conviction upon sentencing.
   Because the judge determined that Mr. Newstat had lied
during his testimony he revoked bond and ordered Mr. Newstat
to immediately begin serving his jail sentence. Prosecutors
said he didn't make any statement before sentencing.
   Mr. Greenberg, a lawyer who had been Mr. Newstat's
business partner, was sentenced to five years in prison,
fined $250,000, and ordered to provide 1,200 hours of legal
service to various Philadelphia agencies that work with poor
people. Mr. Greenberg, who had pleaded guilty to bankruptcy
fraud and conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud, was ordered
to report to prison in May. After serving his jail sentence,
Mr. Greenberg will be on probation for three years, the judge
ruled.
   Prosecutors said Mr. Greenberg read a statement in which
he blamed Enduro's collapse on outside factors such as market
conditions and high interest rates.
