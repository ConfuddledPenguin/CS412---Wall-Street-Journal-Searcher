   PURCHASE, N.Y. -- International Paper Co. posted a 19%
decline in net income for the first quarter despite a 23%
rise in sales, blaming the drop on high capital spending and
low prices for some products.
   The maker of paper and pulp products, which declined to
forecast 1990 results, may face further pressure this year as
it proceeds with a planned $1.1 billion in capital spending
to improve plants and equipment this year.

   International Paper said first-quarter net fell to $180
million, or $1.65 a share, from $223 million, or $1.96 a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.2 billion from $2.6
billion. The company attributed the decline to lower prices
for paper pulps and printing paper that it sells.
International Paper also cited a slightly higher tax rate
overall because of rates in foreign markets and in some
states, and manufacturing delays caused by bad weather and
plant construction.
   John A. Georges, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the most significant first-quarter price declines were
for uncoated printing and writing papers. He said that
"recent increases in industry capacity led to price
reductions even though sales volume remained at healthy
levels." Price increases effective April 1 indicate an
improved supply-demand balance, the company said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
International Paper rose 62.5 cents to $52.125.
