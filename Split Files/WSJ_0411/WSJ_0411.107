   Citing "continuing favorable economic developments,"
Dresdner Bank AG said its earnings in 1989 grew strongly.
   The West German commercial banking group said its group
partial operating profit rose 17% to 1.88 billion marks
($1.11 billion) from 1.60 billion marks ($944 million) a year
earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On a group basis, the company said that the full operating
profit climbed at a higher rate than the partial operating
profit because of higher earnings from trading for its own
account. The bank didn't provide any data on full operating
profit.
   Partial operating profit excludes profit or losses from
trading for its own account. Group results contain all of the
bank's world-wide activities.
