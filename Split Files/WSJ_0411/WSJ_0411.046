   NEW YORK -- Apple Bancorp, mounting a defense against an
unsolicited tender offer, said its directors unanimously
rejected the $121.6 million proposal by its largest
shareholder and directed managers to seek other possible
bids.
   The thrift holding company said directors found the
$38-a-share offer from real-estate investor Stanley Stahl to
be against the company's and shareholders' interests. It said
directors have been advised by Apple's financial adviser,
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., that the offer
was financially unfair. The company recommended that
shareholders reject the offer and not tender their shares to
Mr. Stahl, who already owns a 30.6% Apple stake. Apple
Bancorp is the parent of Apple Bank for Savings.

   The company's shares rose sharply on news of Mr. Stahl's
$38-a-share offer late last month, and closed yesterday at
$41.875 each, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Before the offer, Apple Bancorp shares had
been trading around $32 each.
   Mr. Stahl couldn't be reached for comment on the
rejection.
   In further defensive moves, the company said it is filing
a lawsuit in federal court in Delaware and bolstering Apple's
anti-takeover shareholder-rights plan. Apple said the suit
alleges that Mr. Stahl's bid violates federal disclosure
requirements and is "materially misleading."
   The shareholder-rights plan, which allows holders to
acquire additional shares at half price under certain
circumstances, was amended to be triggered even if a suitor
owned 80% of the shares as a result of a tender offer.
Previously, the plan wouldn't have been applicable under such
circumstances. Another change allows directors to redeem the
rights for a period after a stockholder becomes an "acquiring
person" under the plan.
   In the wake of the developments, Apple said, it also
postponed the annual meeting, which was planned for late May.
Apple didn't set a new date.
   Apple had assets of $3.8 billion at the end of 1989. It
has 35 branches in New York City, Long Island and Westchester
County.
