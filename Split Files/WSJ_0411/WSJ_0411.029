   OTTAWA -- Canada's House of Commons approved legislation
to introduce a 7% consumption tax effective Jan. 1.
   The bill also needs to be approved by the Senate, which is
expected to hold lengthy hearings on the proposal.

<TEXT>
   The value-added tax would replace a more narrowly based
13.5% manufacturing sales tax. It is to be applied to most
goods and services except basic groceries, prescription drugs
and medical services. Credits are to be paid to low-income
Canadians to offset the tax's impact.
   Canadian businesses are to levy the tax on domestic sales.
They are to be allowed to claim a credit for any tax they pay
on purchases of goods and services. The burden of the tax is
to fall on consumers.
