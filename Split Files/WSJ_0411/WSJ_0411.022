   WARSAW -- From the mezzanine of the new Marriott Hotel,
the waltzes of the string ensemble and the strolling
minstrel's Italian serenades float down through the ferns to
mix with wisps of talk in the lobby bar.
   ". . . technical support . . ."

   ". . . diamond prospect in Brazil . . ."
   "They have belly dancers here?"
   "I've seen stranger things than that on an expense
account."
   Westerners, most of them fresh off the plane, pack the
place: aid teams, bureaucrats, bankers, businessmen,
consultants, carpetbaggers.
   At a corner banquette, a Pole unrolls a factory floor plan
for a dark-suited contact. Citibank's man sits alone by a
window. "Nosing around," someone whispers. "Lives in the
hotel." Sipping espresso at the bar, a reticent English
property broker lets on that he's out to pick up office space
to service the West's big rush East.
   "Terrific scarcity," he confides. His best discoveries:
the vacated buildings of Poland's defunct Communist Party.
   When the Russians laid claim to Poland, they built the
Palace of Culture, a lugubrious stake that still rises to a
Stalinist pinnacle in the heart of Warsaw. Now the Marriott
has shot up across the street, its American flag aflutter and
its 520 rooms booked solid by capitalist claim jumpers,
advancing in their accustomed chaos on this new -- and
overwhelmed -- frontier.
   "It's the fashion," says the hotel's delighted sales
manager. "Everyone wants to come to Eastern Europe." Beurt
SerVaas, an American from Indiana who set up a company here
in the dark days of 1983, asks: "When they discovered gold in
California, was there confusion?"
   Sure. But in the gold rush, everyone at least knew what to
look for. In Eastern Europe, they don't.
   The Marshall Plan's billions rebuilt lands wrecked by war
yet favored by the flickering memory of capitalism. Communism
purged the East's memory long ago, and bulldozed the
groundwork necessary for doing business. The prospectors in
the Marriott bar aren't sure where to start. The West's
agents of official largess have it no better. Without
experience in unmaking communism, they are pledging billions
to untried bureaucrats who haven't the vaguest notion how to
spend it all.
   "The Poles aren't very articulate in defining what they
want," a Western banker says, "and we don't know exactly what
we have to offer." Sir William Ryrie, head of the World
Bank's International Finance Corporation, wrote recently:
"People who know a lot about how capitalist economies work
should not imagine that they therefore know how to make the
transition from communism."
   With other Klondikes beckoning from Bucharest to Berlin,
chances are Western business won't drop much cash in Poland
very soon. Nor are the Poles about to absorb the billions
that Western governments and agencies will pump in here this
year. But if Lech Walesa can bring the U.S. Congress to its
feet by calling for "an investment adequate to the greatness
of the American nation," the Marriott bar will stay packed
anyway.
   Thanks to all the ballyhoo, a Westerner can make good
money in today's Eastern Europe -- by hustling the other
Westerners.
   Newsletters have busted out all over. Nor does a week pass
without a conference on opportunities in the East bloc. Big
consulting-banking-accounting firms with some knowledge of
the area are hiring out to companies with none at all. Law
firms and public-relations firms have signed on to coach
newborn investment funds.
   Experts who used to comb Communist tomes in obscurity are
hot properties now. Academics put out press releases. A
businessman from Chicago plans to cart everyone around Warsaw
in stretch limousines. And the Marriott will give them all a
night's rest -- for dollars.
   "They think they can hitchhike on the gravy train," says
Jules Zonn, seated beside the magazine rack one day at the
U.S. Trade Development Center. He spent many years in
America, and came back to his home country to open a shoe
factory. When the commercial attache walks in, Mr. Zonn, who
has no appointment, buttonholes him.
   "I need some money," he says. "How to approach this?"
   Edgar Fulton, a young man with a blond beard, acquires a
look of deep strain. "I'll give you five minutes," he says.
"There will be an enterprise fund." Mr. Zonn lights up. "But
it is to assist Polish private companies. It wasn't created
to help Americans."
   Mr. Zonn changes tack. "Mr. Smith from Kansas City wants
to know about Poland. I'll work for him for $100 a day. So
nobody takes him for a ride. You know, many people are
wanting to take you for a ride." He presents his card, and
goes. Walking up to his office, Mr. Fulton mumbles, "I'm
under siege."
   So are the Poles.
   In a recent week Andrzej Burzynski, who dispenses legal
advice at the Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade, met a team
from a new mutual fund; an American with a textile idea,
another with office-building plans and one with a tobacco
project; a Swiss industrialist, a Swedish water-purification
engineer, a Dutch consultant, and a West German writing a
thesis on Western investment in Poland.
   "How do you organize your business cards?" Mr. Burzynski
says. "I put them in my pocket and have another coat the next
day." He searches his desk for more. "My problem is weeding
out the ones with nothing behind the card. I don't
understand. Is it an ego trip? They come to this country and
make out to be big businessmen?"
   Solidarity's newspaper gives some answers in a guide to
spotting the latter-day carpetbagger: He carries a "renowned
and expensive attache case . . . is immaculately dressed,
owns a gold pen and a Rolex watch . . . and will be staying
at the Warsaw Marriott since the cost of his trip is paid by
someone else. . . ." Yet, as any Westerner seeking contacts
here knows, a type just as smooth is evolving in Poland.
   With the central planners out, even foreigners with
established trade ties have lost their bearings. New laws
have snatched away special favors. Solidarity's economic
therapy makes costs tough to judge. Private entrepreneurs,
socked by inflation, promise anything for dollars. Old
apparatchiks peddle state property as if they owned it.
Adrift in this maelstrom, a stranger needs a lifeline.
   The Foreign Investment Agency won't toss one. Its new
director, Zbigniew Piotrowski, is a free-marketeer who thinks
all but the biggest deals should sink or swim.
   "If Anderson and Kowalski want to make furniture, OK, it's
fine by me," he says. But where does Anderson find Kowalski?
For that, he needs a matchmaker.
   A dating service at the Warsaw office of Unido, the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization, lists Polish
companies pursuing partners to make deodorant sticks, quilted
fleece liners, glass frit and the like. It has 1,000 entries
and aims for 10,000. Other agencies have lists of their own.
"It's disorganized," says Mr. Burzynski at the Chamber of
Foreign Trade, which also has a list. "We don't know how it
is done in the world."
   To plow through the lists, a foreigner requires a
consultant. At least 23 have appeared, though none so far to
help pick consultants. "It's terra incognita," says Krzysztof
Loth, who heads Unido here. "All new start-ups." One of them,
TKD, has a terrific leak in its headquarters ceiling one
Friday morning.
   "Catastrophe," says Dorota Ziemba, the office manager,
leading the way past a crew of plumbers into a back room.
   TKD has a roster of 40 consultants, from the School of
Planning and Statistics, who produce feasibility studies at
$2,000 a shot. It has signed on to work with the giant
Western firm of Ernst &amp; Young, and has lately drawn a flow of
Polish businessmen anxious for mates. "Taxes are so high,
they don't know what to do," says Ms. Ziemba. "They just walk
in the door." As Wojciech Sedzicki does now.
   "I make concentrated protein from animal blood," he says,
as Ms. Ziemba brings in a consultant, 26-year-old Jaroslaw
Drozdowski. Mr. Sedzicki shows him a plastic packet of dark,
grainy stuff. "I'm searching for an American to help me
continue this business. I have no hard currency." The
consultant hands back the packet and grins.
   "What do you need? A buyer? A partner? Are you interested
in expanding?" Mr. Sedzicki loosens his tie. "Of course."
   "We'll see what we can do." Mr. Drozdowski says.
"Sometimes we get people with money who don't know what to do
with it."
   A private investor naturally has the choice of doing
nothing. Not so a public investor. Ready or not, Poland
stands this year to get $3 billion in grants, credits and
credit guarantees from the West's unlocked civic vaults, plus
$3 billion more in each of the next two years. Boggled aid
agents are scrambling to deliver it.
   "They're under tremendous pressure to produce something
that politically looks good," one says. U.S. government
agencies have opted out; private American advisers will route
America's millions. Other donors are stretched thin. "It's
not the money, it's the manpower," says another aid worker.
"Some people have no country experience, probably haven't
even visited. But on their desks are major technical
decisions to be made."
   Polish industry, 95% of it still state-owned, has
meanwhile hit Solidarity with proposals worth $6.5 billion.
"Most are absolutely irrelevant," says Jacek Adamski, an
economist sifting them at the Central Planning Office. He
wouldn't risk spending more than $1.4 billion. "There is a
great danger that some of this money can be wasted," he says.
"We can increase our debt, but intelligently." Poland already
owes the West $39 billion.
   Twice a month, 24 aid-giving nations meet somewhere in the
West to look for ways to avoid tripping over each other in
Poland. But to govern this gang, the Poles have five people
in one small office at the end of a long red carpet in the
council of ministers. They have two computers, no secretary,
no fax and no photocopier.
   "There are people responsible for granting Xerox
machines," Hubert Szlaszewski says in a borrowed office; he
doesn't have one yet. "Our minister signs a letter. It must
go to a high level."
   Even more than a copier, Mr. Szlaszewski wants a channel
for the cash torrent. A development bank might do, or a
foundation. But he would also like to see those 24 countries
hold some meetings in Warsaw, and to give the Poles a seat at
the table. "We badly need assistance," he says, gathering his
papers. "The delicate part is making sure it reaches the
right places."
   The Turkish ambassador has arrived. He has to run.
   Back in the Marriott bar, Doug Gustafson sympathizes, up
to a point. The International Finance Corporation's man in
charge of everything from Portugal to North Yemen is proud to
say he's jumped ahead of the pack in Poland, with two aid
projects up and running.
   "It's just been hectic as hell for everyone," Mr.
Gustafson, an American, admits over a beer after a hard day.
"Some of it is kind of crazy. Nobody has done this before.
It's messy. But that's what freedom's about, and we may as
well get on with it."
