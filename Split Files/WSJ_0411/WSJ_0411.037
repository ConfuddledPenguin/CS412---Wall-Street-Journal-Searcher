   Tokyo stocks retraced recent gains and ended sharply lower
yesterday, after two days of advances of more than 1,000
points.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down 773.25
points at 29624.68. The index surged 1,119.15 points Monday.

   In early trading Wednesday, the Nikkei index was up 304.05
points to 29928.73.
   Volume on the first section Tuesday was estimated at 550
million shares, much lower than 800 million shares Monday.
   There were 609 declining issues, 255 advancing and 80
unchanged.
   The broad-based Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed in the first section, which gained 80.01 points
Monday, lost 43.03 points, or 1.9%, at 2186.24.
   But the second section index, which surged 106.66 points
Monday, added another 21.73 points, or 0.62%, to close at
3519.96. Volume in the second section was estimated at 10
million shares, up from 7 million Monday.
   Observers said that the market's retracement can be
attributed in part to a simple technical correction on the
Nikkei's gains. The Nikkei had advanced 2,150 points since
Thursday, based on the short-term yen rally that resulted
from the Group of Seven meeting in Paris over the weekend,
traders said.
   Amy Yip, a sales manager at Baring Securities Ltd., said
that those who have been saying the Nikkei would consolidate
after its tumble from record highs saw their predictions
realized in advances Friday and Monday. But "enough is enough
already," she said, as investors who were waiting for this
opportunity to see higher prices took profits in broad
selling.
   Participants have several scenarios in which to be
bearish, Ms. Yip said. But namely, the weaker yen and the
insignificant impact of the Group of Seven meeting are
discouraging, she said.
   Ms. Yip said that the market has discredited one local
financial daily's bullish assessment of the Group of Seven
meeting. "Once they saw that overseas papers were very
low-key, or even critical or cynical, they felt that the G-7
(meeting) meant nothing," she said.
   Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager of research and a portfolio
adviser at West LB Securities Pacific Ltd., predicted that
the Nikkei will likely trade sluggishly between 28000 and
30000 for the near term. Baring's Ms. Yip said that 28000
points remains a solid support level, at which bargain
hunting should come in, while profit-taking should be
expected anywhere between 30000 and 31000.
   Underlying support for the Nikkei index is based on the
assumption that Japanese interest rates won't rise as long as
the yen maintains a stable range, traders said.
   Yesterday afternoon was largely a dealers' market, as
individual investors stayed clear from professionals seeking
to make a quick turnaround, observers said.
   Investors took profits in a broad range of selling, except
for pharmaceutical shares, which are expected to have strong
earnings reports because of new products, Ms. Yip said.
   Daiichi Pharmaceutical shares added 50 yen to 2580 yen
($16.33), Fuso Pharmaceutical advanced 70 yen to 1,520,
Mochida gained 40 yen to 3,900 and SS Pharmaceutical was up
50 yen to 1,450.
   Fishery stocks also performed well, as Kyokuyo gained 108
yen to 1,030 and Nippon Suisan added 27 yen to 748.
   But high-priced, high-tech electricals, which haven't been
hurt by the weaker yen because of their export-oriented
businesses, were hit by profit-taking. Fanuc fell 70 yen to
7,300, Pioneer was down 70 yen to 6,150 and Kyocera lost 60
yen to 7,720. Sony fell 80 yen to 8,570.
   In West Germany, share prices on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange fell 1.3% in nervous trading, as worries about the
proposed currency union with East Germany continue to damp
the market's sentiment.
   The DAX index finished the day 25.35 points lower at
1898.51, the first time it has ended below 1900 since March
16. That came after a drop of 23.98 points, or more than
1.2%, on Monday.
   Traders said the weakness in Tokyo also rippled through
European exchanges.
   Continuing weakness in the German bond market because of
lingering worries about the form of the currency union with
East Germany also contributed to the drop.
   Market participants also pointed to an interview in Die
Welt, in which Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said that
the central bank would have to take steps to block inflation
if a 1-for-1 exchange rate for East German marks is
introduced.
   Daimler-Benz, which dropped 19 marks ($11.22) Monday, fell
a further 15 marks to 921 ($544). It was joined by other
bellwether issues, such as Deutsche Bank, which fell 12.50
marks to 788, and Siemens, which dropped 5.70 marks to
772.50.
   Elsewhere, in the auto sector Bayerische Motoren Werke
eased 11 marks to 593, Volkswagen tumbled 7 marks to 594, and
Porsche was unchanged at 1,120.
   In the banking sector, Dresdner Bank dropped 9.50 marks to
421, despite reporting higher 1989 earnings. Commerzbank,
which reported weaker 1989 results earlier in April, dropped
5.20 to 285.80. Bayerische Vereinsbank lost 8.50 to 365.
   In London, share prices finished lower in lackluster
dealings, as Tokyo's overnight drop and a smattering of
disturbing corporate news early in the session set the
market's downward tone.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
down 10.2 points at 2217.5, a rebound from its intraday low
of 2207.3.
   The narrower 30-share index shed 9.8 points, closing at
1732.5. Volume was a slight 367.6 million shares traded, but
better than the 304.6 million of Monday.
   Dealers said they expect the lean volume to continue
through the rest of the week, ahead of Easter.
   Besides a handful of disappointing corporate
announcements, dealers noted that the drop in world oil
prices overnight also translated into downward pressure on
oil-company shares, some of which represent a significant
component of the 100-share index.
   B.A.T Industries, the financial services and tobacco
conglomerate, lost 15 pence to 740 pence ($12.10) a share,
after insurance regulators in California dealt a blow to Sir
James Goldsmith's bid for the diversified British
conglomerate. B.A.T has large insurance subsidiaries in
California and several other states.
   Full-year results from several companies did nothing to
help the market or the individual stocks, dealers added.
Clothing retailer Next, once a rising star of British
retailing, shed 6 pence to 73 after reporting a #46.7 million
($76.4 million) loss. Its results were hurt by restructuring
costs and the downturn in consumer spending.
   RMC, a cement concern, plummeted 25 pence to 615 despite a
20% increase in pretax profit. A warning over difficult
trading conditions in 1990 by the company helped erode
confidence in its share price, dealers said.
   Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed lower in Paris,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels and Milan, and were mixed in
Stockholm.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, share prices closed lower in
Hong Kong, Manila, Sydney, Taipei and Seoul, and were higher
in Singapore and Wellington.
