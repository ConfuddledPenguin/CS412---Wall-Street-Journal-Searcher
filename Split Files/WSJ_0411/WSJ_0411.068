   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Westcoast Energy Inc. said
it plans to build with a partner a 106 million Canadian
dollar (US$91.3 million) cogeneration plant that will supply
electricity to B.C. Hydro, a provincially owned utility.
   The proposed McMahon Cogeneration Plant, which Westcoast
plans to build at Taylor in partnership with the CU Power
division of Canadian Utilities Ltd., would supply 105
megawatts of electricity to B.C. Hydro, beginning in October
1993.

   Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity
and steam, for use in industrial processes.
   B.C. Hydro said the contract with Westcoast and its
partner is valued at more than C$45 million annually, and
would run 20 years from the plant's start-up date. The
electric utility, Canada's third-biggest, said the new plant
is part of its push to encourage independent power production
in British Columbia, where consumption of electric power is
growing rapidly, along with the province's economy.
   Westcoast, a big natural-gas pipeline, utility, and oil
and gas production concern, said the new plant would be
located at the site of its existing McMahon gas processing
plant, in northeastern British Columbia.
