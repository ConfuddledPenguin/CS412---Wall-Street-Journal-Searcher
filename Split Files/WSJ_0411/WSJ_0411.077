   Motorola Inc. reported a 3.3% rise in first-quarter
profit, but its stock jumped on indications that the
company's computer-chip business is rebounding.
   Separately, a federal judge delayed until June 18 a key
decision in a heated patent-infringement fight between
Motorola and Hitachi Ltd., assuring that a vital chip supply
isn't in danger of being cut off before then.

   Motorola, a maker of electronic devices and
semiconductors, said earnings rose to $127 million, or 98
cents a share, from $123 million, or 95 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales climbed 16% to $2.53 billion from $2.18
billion.
   The earnings figure topped many analysts' projections,
largely on the strength of better-than-anticipated results
for its semiconductor line, which has been depressed by soft
industry conditions.
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said it has seen
"some promising early indications of renewed strength" in
that market. Although the segment's operating profit was off
from a year earlier, semiconductor sales rose 13% and backlog
climbed 17%.
   The earnings news comes on the heels of recent industry
trade group figures showing that chip orders grew at a solid
rate in March. Semiconductor products represented about 30%
of Motorola's sales in 1989; the firm doesn't break out
segment profitability on a quarterly basis.
   First Boston Corp. analyst John M. Geraghty, who had been
expecting earnings of 85 cents to 90 cents a share, said the
chip operation apparently "did a little bit better" than
anticipated. Motorola's semiconductor business, which he
noted "has been under pressure," appears to have put the
worst of the latest industry downturn behind it "for the near
term," he said.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Motorola
shares surged $4.25, or 6.6%, to close at $68.50. Volume was
nearly two million shares.
   The company's communications sector, which last year
represented about a third of total sales, showed an 11% rise
in revenue and a 22% increase in orders. Operating profit
declined because of extensive outlays for product
development.
   Motorola's general systems sector, which includes the
company's fast-growing and increasingly important
cellular-phone division, had a 53% jump in sales and higher
operating profit. General systems represented 19% of sales
last year although that proportion is expected to continue
expanding.
   Meanwhile, Judge Lucius D. Bunton, sitting in Austin,
Texas, said he would wait to rule on a Hitachi motion urging
him to lift a stay of an earlier injunction in the convoluted
case. The stay permitted both Motorola and Hitachi to
continue selling the 68030 microprocessor chip, even though
the judge earlier ruled that Hitachi and Motorola had
infringed on each other's patents.
   Motorola said it intends to appeal Judge Bunton's original
patent infringement decision. Hitachi couldn't be reached to
comment.
