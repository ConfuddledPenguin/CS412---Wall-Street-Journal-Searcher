   NEW YORK -- A federal appeals court panel affirmed a lower
court's decision to dismiss antitrust and tort claims filed
by Twin Laboratories Inc. against its rival in selling
nutritional supplements for bodybuilders, Weider Health &amp;
Fitness.
   In February 1989, Twin Labs, Ronkonkoma, N.Y., sued
Weider, of Woodland Hills, Calif., in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. The suit charged Weider with trying to exclude
competition in selling the supplements. Weider did this, the
suit said, by denying ad space to Twin Labs in two
bodybuilding magazines it publishes.

   U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey dismissed the suit,
ruling that Twin Labs hadn't proved that Weider had
monopolized the supplements market or that ad space in
Weider's magazines was essential for Twin Labs to compete.
The judge also said Weider made a "legitimate and responsible
business decision" when it denied the ad space to Twin Labs.
   Twin Labs appealed the question of whether the ad space
was essential to competition. The appeals court found that
Twin Labs "has remained an effective competitor with Weider
despite" the refusal to accept the ads.
   The appeals court also denied Twin Labs's appeal of Judge
Mukasey's dismissal of its tort claim made under New York
state law: that the denial of ad space was designed not as a
business decision but only as a way to harm Twin Labs.
   Twin Labs "is not a 90-pound weakling in whose face Weider
has kicked sand," the court said. "Rather, (Twin Labs) is a
muscular competitor who is complaining about the competitive
process."
   Alan Malasky, Weider's attorney at Arent, Fox, Kintner,
Plotkin &amp; Kahn in Washington, said that "the court of
appeals' ruling confirms that Weider has acted properly in
all respects."
   Grant L. Clark, attorney for Twin Labs at Washington's
Rivkin, Radler, Bayh, Hart &amp; Kremer, said the company is
deciding whether to further appeal, but he said that "Twin
Labs is doing entirely too well for people to feel it's a
weakling.
