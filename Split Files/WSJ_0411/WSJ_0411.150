   Showtime Networks Inc. acquired the exclusive rights to a
package of movies from New Line Cinema Corp., the producers
of the hit movie "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Terms
weren't disclosed.
   Other than the "Turtles" movie, the package comprises
seven titles, including "House Party," "A Nightmare on Elm
Street 5," "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3" and "Book of Love."

   According to a Showtime spokeswoman, the unit of Viacom
International Inc. will broadcast the "Turtles" film next
spring. The first film to air on Showtime will be from the
"Nightmare" series in July.
   The deal between a pay-cable network and a studio comes
two days after MCA Inc.'s Universal Pictures unit agreed to
provide CBS Inc. with all of its direct 1989 releases for
about $50 million. It was the first time in more than a
decade that a television network won first-run broadcast
rights from a Hollywood studio. Usually, movies first appear
on cable TV.
   Separately, CBS said new, one-hour animated episodes of
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" will join the TV network's
Saturday morning line-up beginning in September. The CBS
series won't affect the weekday half-hour animated series
based on the four comic book characters.
