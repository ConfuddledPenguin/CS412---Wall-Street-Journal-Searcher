   Lomas Financial Corp., Dallas, said its Lomas Mortgage USA
subsidiary agreed to buy the $3.5 billion mortgage-servicing
portfolio of Bright Mortgage Co. from Resolution Trust Corp.
   A spokeswoman said the government agency will receive $33
million in cash for the portfolio, leaving it with $100
million in Bright Mortgage assets still to liquidate. It said
Lomas was one of three bidders for the portfolio.

   Lomas said the purchase will increase its
mortgage-servicing portfolio by 17% to $24.5 billion from $21
billion and marks its largest acquisition in recent years.
   Lomas Financial, which is operating under protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
said it already has received court approval for the
transaction. It said the move will allow its core
mortgage-banking business to continue to grow.
   Bright Mortgage previously was a unit of Bright Banc, a
Dallas-based savings and loan that was sold by regulators in
early February to Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio.
