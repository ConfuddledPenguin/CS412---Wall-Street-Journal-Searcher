   Detroit Edison Co. said 20,000 gallons of radioactive
water leaked inside the company's Fermi 2 nuclear plant after
an unplanned shutdown.
   No one was contaminated by the water or hurt in the
shutdown, Detroit Edison said, but the plant remains closed
pending investigation.

   A spokesman for the utility company said the plant
automatically shut down after a partial power loss. The
company said it doesn't know what caused the outage.
   A few hours after the shutdown, the radioactive water
spilled onto the floor of the turbine room and then drained
into the radioactive waste water recovery system, which
processes such waste water for reuse.
   In July 1988, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned
Detroit Edison the $4.58 billion plant risked being closed
unless its performance improved. The commission later dropped
the facility from its list of troubled plants. Fermi 2 had
been on the list for three years.
