   The U.S. Sentencing Commission, unable to muster majority
support, put off debate on proposed guidelines that federal
judges would have to follow when imposing criminal fines and
probation on companies.
   The delay is a temporary victory for business groups that
mounted an all-out lobbying effort against tough guidelines.

   Actions by the seven-member commission require at least
four votes. As there are three vacancies now, all four
commissioners must approve every step. Yesterday, one member,
Judge George MacKinnon, effectively blocked action on
corporate guidelines by refusing to vote for any proposals
until the three vacancies are filled.
   His announcement prompted the chairman, Judge William
Wilkins, to defer action until next year. The guidelines must
be reviewed by Congress.
   Andrew Frey, a Washington lawyer who has monitored the
commission's drafts for several corporations, said the delay
"seems sensible" because more study of the proposals is
needed. But John Coffee, a Columbia University Law School
professor, said the decision was delayed because "there was
no possibility of compromising" between factions favoring
tougher and weaker corporate sanctions.
   The three vacancies must be filled by President Bush in
consultation with Senate Democrats, because the commission
must be bipartisan. The White House has nominated Julie
Carnes, an assistant U.S. attorney in Atlanta, for one seat.
   Another slot is expected to go to Michael Gelacak, a
Washington lawyer and former aide to Sen. Joseph Biden (D.,
Del.). The leading candidate for the third seat is U.S. Judge
David Mazzone of Boston, who is supported by Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D., Mass.), congressional aides said. The three must
be confirmed by the Senate.

   CITIZENS' GROUP wins appeal clarifying water-polluter
penalties.
   The 11th U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned a
federal judge's dismissal of a water pollution suit against
Tyson Foods Inc. The decision clarifies when private
citizens' groups can seek civil penalties from water
polluters. The lower court had dismissed the case because the
Springdale, Ark., poultry processor solved its problem after
the suit was filed.
   But the appeals court ruled that penalties against Tyson
are appropriate because the company was violating federal
pollution standards when the suit was filed. It told the
lower court to calculate penalties against Tyson for
polluting waters at its Blountsville, Ala., processing
facility from the time it bought the plant in 1986 until it
came into compliance in February 1988.
   According to Eric Huber, an attorney for Atlantic States
Legal Foundation Inc., an environmental group, the ruling
strengthens such group's ability to bring private suits and
seek civil penalties under the Clean Water Act. He said Tyson
will face as much as $12.6 million in penalties plus
attorneys' fees. The penalties will go to the U.S. Treasury.
   "We will argue vigorously that nowhere close to the
maximum penalty is in order," said H. Thomas Wells, an
attorney for Tyson, noting the company acquired the plant
from a company in bankruptcy proceedings and acted quickly to
draft plans to correct the problem before the suit was filed.
   Tyson's only alternative, he said, would have been to
close the plant, leaving workers jobless while a new
waste-water treatment system was installed.

   LEGAL SERVICES CORP.'S departing chief eligible for
"burlap parachute."
   Terrance Wear, the aggressive, conservative president of
the poverty-law grant agency, referred to the issue as a
"private matter," adding that the LSC is "not a federal
entity." He declined further comment on the sum, $37,750,
which is equivalent to one-half his annual salary. The
contract arrangement was first reported in the Los Angeles
Daily Journal, a legal trade paper.
   Mr. Wear last month announced his resignation from the
private corporation, effective June 30. The LSC's $321
million budget is entirely funded by the federal government.
Although Mr. Wear isn't a political appointee, he was hired
by the agency's politically appointed board during the Reagan
administration.
   LSC board Chairman George Wittgraf said that Mr. Wear
resigned at his suggestion. The chairman said he felt that
the Bush-appointed board should choose its own administrator.
He called the severance agreement a "burlap parachute" rather
than a "golden parachute." But Alan Morrison, director of the
Public Citizen Litigation Group, a public interest
organization, said, "If I were a member of the board, I would
have been extremely reluctant to provide any kind of
severance benefits."
   Severance agreements are standard at the LSC, but more
generous than those at the similarly structured Corporation
for Public Broadcasting, which receives more than 90% of its
funding from the federal government.
   According to general counsel Paul Symczak, severance
available to CPB officers "doesn't anywhere approach 50%."
