   There are inherent ambiguities in the American approach to
foreign affairs. We are being driven by a team of four
horses, each with a mind of its own, and it is no easy matter
to prevent them from tearing the stagecoach apart. The four
horses, representing four established modes of thought about
our posture toward the world, are:
   -- Moralistic isolationism, in which the U.S. presents a
shining example of popular government to the world, in the
hope that the nations of the world will notice, be impressed,
and eventually follow suit. We may be saddened if they fail
to do so, but it is not our responsibility to guide them --
and certainly not to coerce them -- along this path. At most,
we may express approval or disapproval of their more extreme
deviations.

   -- Liberal internationalism, a 70-year-old tradition that
has taken tenacious root in the State Department, the media,
academia, and even -- though to a far lesser degree -- among
sections of the populace at large. This envisions a world in
which all nations are obedient to the rules of international
law, as laid down by the United Nations and the World Court
-- a "peace loving" world to be governed eventually by a
"parliament of man" (now re-designated as a "parliament of
persons"). Our State Department is much attached to the
legalisms generated by such a perspective. Most of the other
nations in today's world pay little or no attention to it.
   -- Conservative internationalism, which believes the U.S.
has an original commitment to act unilaterally so as to make
the world safe for "democratic capitalism."
   -- National-interest "realism," which generally prefers
unilateral American action to any multilateral commitment,
but asserts that we should be seriously concerned only about
events abroad that affect us seriously, less seriously
concerned by what affects us only indirectly or obliquely or
remotely, and not at all concerned by what is likely to have
no appreciable effect at all. This is a more complicated
affair than many realists seem to realize, since the U.S. is
a world power and both its action and inaction can be equally
influential. But it is the most venerable mode of thought
about foreign policy, to which most nations, most of the
time, pay obeisance. In the case of the U.S., it often is
co-opted by one of the three other modes, since no one wants
to assert that he is indifferent to something called "the
national interest."
   These four modes of thought are now thoroughly entangled
in the case of Lithuania. Such entanglements are predestined.
We discovered this in the case of Vietnam. Our moralistic
isolationists -- fewer then than now -- saw no reason for our
becoming bloodily involved in this faraway land, and would
have been content with a few symbolic, diplomatic gestures.
Our liberal internationalists got us into the war in order to
affirm the illegality of aggression, direct or indirect, by
one nation against another. Our conservative
internationalists, along with our realists, were divided,
depending on what they saw to be at stake. Some said that we
should simply stay out, others that we should boldly confront
North Vietnam (and perhaps China) to prevent a Communist
takeover of Southeast Asia, and keep open the prospects for
democracy there. None supported the limited war we did fight.
   In the case of Lithuania, it must be said, our confusion
is more than matched by Mikhail Gorbachev's confused
policies. Indeed, one has the right to wonder: Does Mr.
Gorbachev know what he is doing? Is there any rational
explanation, however devious, for his fumbling, irresolute,
in the end bewildering and self-defeating approach to this
issue?
   I don't see any such rational explanation. First, he
announced that he would not use force against Lithuania,
thereby inciting the Lithuanians to declare their
independence from the U.S.S.R. Then he announced that he is
working on some complicated scheme whereby the various ethnic
regions of the Soviet Union would gain not only a large
measure of autonomy, but also the right of secession after a
complex legal process of at least five years' duration. This
inevitably inflamed nationalist aspirations in the Ukraine,
Georgia and elsewhere. Then -- to no one's great surprise --
he sent troops into Lithuania.
   He had an obvious, clear-cut alternative. He could have
said, right at the outset, that Lithuania would not be
allowed to secede from the Soviet Union, but that it would be
accorded a real autonomy, spelled out in some detail. For the
world at large, this would have pretty much settled the
matter. While nations may prattle loosely about the "right to
self-determination," no nation has ever recognized a right of
secession.
   True, the case of the three Baltic nations is special,
since they were delivered to Soviet sovereignty by the
noxious Hitler-Stalin pact. Even so, it is clear that were
they to be liberated from Russian rule, the Ukraine -- which
produces about one-third of the Soviet gross national product
-- would probably demand a similar liberation, after several
centuries of subordination. And so would Georgia, and
Azerbaijan, and all the other constituent provinces of
Russia.
   Mr. Gorbachev, to the world's amazement and most of the
world's delight, made the bold decision to preside over the
liquidation of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. But he
did not become president of the U.S.S.R. to preside over the
liquidation of the centuries-old Russian empirean empire that
150 million ethnic Russians today regard as an integral part
of Russia itself.
   Only a political fantasist could expect a withdrawal of
Russia into its ancient ethnic boundaries. Not even the more
militant reformers within the Soviet Union contemplate such a
possibility. In fact, these same reformers have been
prudently silent about Lithuania, since they are well aware
of the larger and more explosive issue of national
disintegration it poses. It is not imaginable that any
Russian government, with or without Mr. Gorbachev, would move
down this path.
   Lithuania is not a lucky country. Perhaps, in a future not
yet foreseeable, under circumstances also unforeseeable, it
will gain the independence it desires and deserves. But it is
not going to happen now, and there is nothing the Bush
administration can do about it. Meanwhile, the Lithuanians
would be well advised to bargain hard for the maximum degree
of autonomy.
   Nevertheless, the administration is coming under much
criticism for recognizing this political reality. There is
even talk of economic sanctions against the Soviet Union. But
this is idle chatter. We tried that under the Carter
administration and it backfired. Besides, not a single one of
our European allies would join us in any such purely
symbolic, totally ineffectual act.
   The Bush administration, quite sensibly, has decided that
it is not in the national interest for the U.S. to
precipitate a crisis in our relations with the Soviet Union
because of Lithuania and the other Baltic nations. In doing
so, it has left itself vulnerable to criticisms emerging from
the other currents of thought about American foreign policy.
As a consequence, it has difficulty articulating sharply, and
defending vigorously, its position. Any American
administration would find itself in the same condition.
   Back in the 1960s, we heard much talk about "speaking
truth to power." In the case of American foreign policy, it
is clear that we have not yet learned how power can speak
unambiguous truths about our national interest to the
American people.
