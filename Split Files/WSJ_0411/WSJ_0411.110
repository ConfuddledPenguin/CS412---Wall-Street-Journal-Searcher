   CAE Industries Ltd. said its Link Flight Simulation
division, of Binghamton, N.Y., was awarded two contracts that
total 51 million Canadian dollars (US$43.9 million) to modify
flight simulators for the U.S. Air Force and Army.
   CAE, an electronic and aviation equipment maker, said a
C$32.7 million contract involves modifying and upgrading
three F16 flight simulators, which it built for the U.S. Air
Force. That project, which includes equipment designed and
built at its Houston plant, is scheduled for completion in
1993. A C$18.3 million contract is for the updating of nine
Apache helicopter combat-mission simulators made by the
company for the U.S. Army. Those modification kits will be
developed in Binghamton. Work is scheduled to be completed in
February 1992.
