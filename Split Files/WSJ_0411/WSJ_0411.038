   TYSONS CORNER, Va. -- United Savings Bank said Citicorp's
Citibank unit is conducting a due-diligence examination of
the savings and loan as prelude to a possible acquisition.
   United Savings said it expects to learn by April 30
whether Citibank intends to negotiate a definitive
acquisition agreement. In a statement, United Savings said
the two companies have "expressed their mutual interest in an
acquisition."

   United Savings said several companies have expressed
interest in acquiring the thrift since it retained an
investment banker to consider a sale.
   A Citibank spokeswoman confirmed the statement released by
United Savings, but wouldn't go beyond it. She said that
since 1982, Citibank has purchased four troubled thrifts. The
thrifts were in Washington, D.C., California, Illinois and
Florida.
