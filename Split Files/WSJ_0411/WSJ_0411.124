   NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it named Marvin
H. Koslow president of its North American consumer products
group, succeeding Ronald A. Ahrens, who is resigning. The
North American consumer products group includes Bristol-Myers
Products, Clairol, and Drackett Co.
   Mr. Koslow had been senior vice president of Bristol-Myers
Squibb. A Bristol-Myers Squibb spokesman said the change had
"nothing to do" with the merger between Bristol-Myers and
Squibb, which occurred in October.
