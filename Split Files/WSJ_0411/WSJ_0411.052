   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. reported
first-quarter net income rose 11% as revenue dropped
slightly.
   The company, with interests in broadcasting, financial
services, community development and power generation
equipment, said net income was $210 million, or $1.43 a
share, compared with $189 million, or $1.30 a share, in the
year-ago quarter.

   Revenue edged down to $2.86 billion from $2.89 billion.
   Analysts said results were in line with expectations.
   Westinghouse didn't make a specific earnings projection
for the year, but said that substantial increases in orders
for electronic systems and power generation equipment "are
positive signs."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Westinghouse closed at $74.75, down 12.5 cents.
   In the quarter, the company had a pretax operating profit
margin of 10.3%, compared with a pretax operating profit
margin of 9.7% a year ago.
   The company didn't break out results for its various
segments, but said revenue and pretax operating profit at the
financial services unit improved substantially because of
significantly higher levels of loans outstanding and
marketable securities.
   Operating profit at the Group W broadcasting unit
decreased because of soft advertising sales in the Northeast
market. Revenue was about even with the year-earlier quarter,
the company said.
   Westinghouse said operating profit at its energy and
utility systems segment rose because of higher revenue in the
power generation business unit.
   The company said revenue and operating profit at its
industries segment gained slightly from the year-earlier
quarter.
   Westinghouse said revenue and operating profit improved at
its commercial segment because of recent acquisitions in the
furniture systems business unit.
   Revenue and operating profit also improved at the
company's electronic systems segment, the company said.
