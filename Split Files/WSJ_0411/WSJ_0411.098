   Tax returns are due Monday. This is an appropriate
occasion to give a moment's thought to environmental law -- a
mushrooming shadow tax code that shapes investment decisions,
productivity and job-formation. Consider only the new Clean
Air Act: The 600-page Senate bill (some version of which will
become the law) would impose a "tax" of more than $21 billion
per year. The Environmental Protection Agency -- a green
version of the Internal Revenue Service -- will send hither
swarms of officers to issue permits, shut down factories, and
impose hefty fines.
   But there's a big difference. The Tax Code is actually a
law. Tax rules bind you, and they bind the IRS. Environmental
"law" is more like a plan than like a law. We "plan" the
environment the way Albania "plans" its economy.

   Suppose the IRS Code looked like this:
                                                                                                       

   Section 1. The IRS shall raise $1.4 trillion by April 15,
1991. The IRS shall propose and adopt all necessary
regulations.
                                                                                                       

   It's unlikely anyone would prefer such a law to the tax
tables and forms that we all know and love. IRS rules and tax
tables inform every citizen in advance how much he will owe
the government; they ensure that citizens will be treated
equally; and they curb arbitrary government action. A revenue
goal (like the fictitious Section 1) has none of these
advantages.
   But Section 1 is how the EPA operates. The core of almost
every environmental statute is a collection of "goals" and
"deadlines" the EPA has to attain. The rules of the game are
largely made up by the EPA (or by courts) along the way.
                                                                                                       

   Section 2. If the IRS fails to raise $1.4 trillion by
April 15, 1990, anyone may sue the IRS Commissioner and
request appropriate relief. The court may order the agency to
take whatever steps are necessary to meet statutory goals.
                                                                                                       

   Most of us would consider such a tax law preposterous
(it's not the business of malcontents to go to court and tell
the government how to run its business) and a bit scary
(private citizens would be able to go to court and force the
government to coerce other citizens).
   Yet every federal environmental statute except one has
such a "citizen suit provision." The purpose? Congress loves
to huff and puff about clean air, clean water and the like.
But when it comes to the truly tough decisions -- who will be
hurt and how much -- Congress would rather pass the buck.
Here's how it works:
   -- Congress intentionally sets the goals and deadlines
("Section 1") so that the EPA cannot possibly reach them.
That way, there are always dozens of missed goals and
deadlines.
   -- Next, environmental groups pick a goal they would like
to see enforced, and run to court to demand enforcement.
That's a lawsuit they can't lose.
   -- Next, the court orders the EPA to "get serious" and
sometimes imposes a plan of its own. A sensible way to
determine environmental priorities? No. More likely, a way of
dodging responsibility.
   The EPA can do things under a court order it could never
do on its own: shut down factories, impose transportation
control plans that tell you where and when you may use your
car, and demand cleanups that cost enormous sums of money.
When someone complains, it's "Sorry, we're under a court
order."
   Congress gets a free ride. After all, it's not Congress
but a federal judge who's curtailing transport and banning
hairspray and barbecue lighters.
                                                                                                       

   Section 3. All private tax records shall be open to the
public. If citizen A believes that citizen B has failed to
pay his taxes in full, A can sue B on the government's behalf
and demand payment of taxes and fines. Citizen A shall be
reimbursed by B for his attorney's fees, and A shall be
permitted to collect and retain, for his private use, any
money B owes the government.
                                                                                                       

   Environmental laws are enforced in this manner -- usually
by environmental advocacy groups. In this way, environmental
organizations have collected tens of millions of dollars for
their pet projects.
   If this principle of environmental law were applied across
the board, there would be no more need to wrangle subsidies
out of Congress. Citizens for Mass Transit could write
tickets for speeding and parking violations and use the money
to expand the subway system. Tenants could assess and collect
fines for building-code violations and buy themselves a
condo. And the Tax Code could be enforced by your neighbor,
your employer or employee, your estranged cousin -- any
fellow citizen.
                                                                                                       

   Section 4. Private property may be taken, for just about
any use or none at all, without compensation.
                                                                                                       

   Let's say you bought a piece of land, not knowing that it
contained hazardous waste. The EPA may declare your land a
toxic waste site and send you a "PRP letter." That means you
are a "potentially responsible party" (although you never
polluted). It also means your land is worthless, your credit
dries up, and you may owe megabucks.
   Or let's say you own a piece of land zoned for industrial
use and want to build a plant or factory. Under the Clean Air
Act, the EPA may declare your city or county a
"non-attainment" area. That may mean a construction ban on
your property, and everyone else's.
   To say that these arbitrary and coercive instruments are
needed to protect the environment is like saying that the IRS
should be a lot more arbitrary because we really need the
revenue. The only advantage of environmental "law" may be
that it puts the hassle of tax filings and even the dreaded
IRS audit into perspective: Compared to environmental law,
the Tax Code is a veritable bill of rights.
