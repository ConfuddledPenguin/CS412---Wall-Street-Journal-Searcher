   WASHINGTON -- John Sturc, a Securities and Exchange
Commission associate enforcement director who handled the
agency's insider-trading cases against Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, said he will resign at
the end of April.
   He will join the Washington office of Gibson, Dunn &amp;
Crutcher next month.

   The eight-year SEC veteran was seen as an important figure
in putting together the cases that rocked Wall Street and
helped make the SEC an aggressive and feared investigator of
insider dealings. Mr. Sturc, a 1975 graduate of the Harvard
Law School, also led the SEC's cases against Martin Siegel
and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Mr. Sturc and William McLucas, director of the division of
enforcement, said the departure won't hurt the SEC's case
against Mr. Milken, the only major case of his that remains
open.
   "His departure is a tremendous loss to the agency and the
division," Mr. McLucas said, "but I don't see it as changing
the focus, direction or continuity in that case in
particular. The case will continue."
   "Bill McLucas is a fantastic lawyer and there are other
people working on these cases and seeing them to a
conclusion," Mr. Sturc said. "I'm not worried about the
Milken case."
   Mr. Sturc's resignation comes four months after SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden elevated Mr. McLucas, who was also
an associate enforcement director, to head the division.
