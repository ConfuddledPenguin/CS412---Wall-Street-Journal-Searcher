   A Runway Walk

   NEW YORK -- Diane DeWitt, blond, rail-thin and one of
Seventh Avenue's top runway models, can really walk That
Walk. With her upper body leaning way back and her hips
swinging smartly, Ms. DeWitt just glides down the runway.
Even a frisky Dalmatian prancing beside her during the Scaasi
show last week couldn't break Ms. DeWitt's perfectly fluid
gait.
   Ms. DeWitt and her runway colleagues know the importance
of a good walk. When fashion-show week rolls around twice
each year, Seventh Avenue takes on all the trappings of a
Broadway opening. There are bright lights, stagy music,
flashing cameras. But the action is The Walk. Designers
choose models as directors choose actors: to reflect their
message and to sell the show.

   "I love to watch {models} just as I like to watch
dancers," says consumer watchdog for NBC-TV and fashion plate
Betty Furness, who has been attending Seventh Avenue shows
for 40 years. While she scrutinizes the fashions, she admits
that "I may be subconsciously lured {to a particular outfit}
by the beauty of their movements."
   "I adore the way the models walk," says Helen Gurley
Brown, editor of Cosmopolitan magazine and a regular at the
Calvin Klein, Donna Karan and Adolfo shows. "It's sexy,
provocative and alluring." If the models walked like most of
us do, "slumped over and schlepping around," she adds, the
designers would never sell any clothes.
   Most clothes look better when they're moving. "A full
skirt may not look good standing still," says Audrey Smaltz,
a veteran fashion show producer, adding, "You gotta give that
skirt to a turner who can really work that dress." On the
runway, a pretty face doesn't necessarily matter. Movement
does.
   Models don't take classes in the art of body undulation or
head tilting. They watch seasoned stars and then develop
their own signature styles. Model Anna Bayle points her legs
as she steps on the balls of her feet; Rebecca Ayoko thrusts
her head forward, like a crane grabbing for a fish, and
robotically moves her arms. Six-footer Aly Dunne contorts her
long neck while her hips swing like a hammock on a lazy
summer day. When she sauntered by in a tight-fitting backless
gown at the Isaac Mizrahi show, the photographers went crazy.
"Aly] Aly]" they whooped.
   "I walk very sexily," Ms. Dunne says. "I can't walk in a
straight line."
   Another distinctive walk belongs to Dalma, a Brazilian
model who, fashion writer David Feld says, "sticks her hips
out there so far that they arrive a minute before the rest of
her body." Dalma maintains that her lilting girl-from-Ipanema
stride is only slightly exaggerated from her everyday walk.
"It's just like when you go to the theater, and an actress
talks louder than normally," she says. "When you are out
there on the runway alone, you gotta use the space."
   No designer brings more theater to the runway than Bob
Mackie, best known for whipping up eye-popping gowns for
Cher. At Mr. Mackie's Americana-theme extravaganza at the
Plaza Hotel last Thursday, where he featured coonskin-style
hats, Amish quilt prints and sparkling, sequinned eagle
motifs, the models pranced and pantomimed to the brassy
marching-brand music of John Philip Sousa.
   Mr. Mackie says he picks models "who have a little more
juice" -- just like his customers, often found among the
Texas jet set. "Even if a model is beautiful but kind of
boring when she walks, I won't use her." Mackie model Lu
Sierra brought the house down when she bent down and shimmied
her entire body in a fringed beaded minidress.
   At Geoffrey Beene's show the models struck a more
mechanical note that went with the sleek, futuristic
jumpsuits he featured. "The sign of a good model," says Mr.
Beene, "is that she gives the feeling that the clothes belong
to her personally." Before every show, Mr. Beene says he
tells the models to "stride as if they are walking through
the city and to forget they are modeling."
   Mr. Beene's sense of decorum is mild compared to that of
Italian designer Giorgio Armani, who dressed actresses
Jessica Tandy and Julia Roberts at this year's Academy Awards
ceremony. Models say Mr. Armani insists that his austere,
tailored clothes are shown with reverence. "Armani tells you
to be expressive with your eyes instead of your body," says
Dalma. For her, this dictum makes his show "one of the most
difficult to work in."
   But most models walk on the wild side -- so much so that
the walk has inspired a dance and a music video. The dance,
called "vogueing," became popular in recent years in New
York's downtown clubs. In pop singer Madonna's new video,
"Vogue," slickly dressed male dancers accompany Madonna in a
wild runway strut routine, in which Madonna commands
breathily: "Strike a pose and Vogue."
   No one remembers who transformed runway modeling from the
formal hands-on-hips, toe-pointed-out to the saucy strut seen
today; but a model named Pat Cleveland, popular since the
late 1960s, is said to have created a lively runway style
that many models imitated. In the disco '70s, the runways
broke out in a nonstop party with models bouncing and
boogeying. "When we took off a coat, we just ripped it off,"
recalls former model Patty Quinn. At some fashion houses,
models took drugs before the shows, making their walks down
the runway zany and unpredictable.
   That was then. Today, unpredictable moves happen for more
pedestrian reasons. Models confront daunting obstacle
courses: bumpy carpeting, steep steps and dozens of jostling
photographers hovering at their feet. Contrary to the way it
looks, models do not float on air: They walk in shoes that
are often two sizes too small or two sizes too big and filled
out with tissue paper. Backstage, assistants scratch the
soles of the stiff, new shoes with scissors to make them less
slippery. But it doesn't always help.
   Last Wednesday, at the Michael Kors show, model Christy
Turlington stepped out of her shoes and had to proceed
without them. Dalma remembers colliding with another model
and tumbling off the runway into a group of photographers.
Ms. Sierra says that she overdid it when she exuberantly
twirled a long fur boa -- and mistakenly lassoed her ankle,
pulling herself down at a big Paris show. Too startled to
regroup, Ms. Sierra says, "I just stayed down there and
posed."
