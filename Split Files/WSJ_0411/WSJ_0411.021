   "When I was a kid in Spokane," Bing Crosby once told me,
"I played drums in a six-piece band. We couldn't read music,
but we just about memorized all the new records by the Mound
City Blues Blowers, the Memphis Five, and the Original
Dixieland Jazz Band. Those sounds, those wonderful sounds,
made me determined to somehow work my way into the company of
jazz musicians."
   And so he did, as a member of the Rhythm Boys, who sang
with Paul Whiteman from 1926 to 1930. His roommate on the
road for a time was Bix Beiderbecke, long portrayed as the
quintessential jazz legend of the fragile boy with a horn who
drank himself to death because he could not bear too much
reality.

   But "it wasn't booze that killed Bix," Crosby said. "He
wasn't an alcoholic. He was a jolly absent-minded sort of
fellow, but he was so totally immersed in music that he never
ate or slept properly. His health broke from exhaustion. Of
course, it seemed that none of us went to bed in those days.
It's amazing that some of us survived."
   Starting in the early 1930s, Crosby left the full-time
company of jazz musicians to star on radio and then in films.
And he kept on recording, often with jazz improvisers in the
band. Although Crosby is most renowned as what used to be
called a crooner -- someone who transforms ballads into
exceptionally intimate conversations -- he also, when the
spirit moved him, sang jazz with exhilarating authority. He
was not just a "jazz-influenced" singer. Crosby could be the
real thing. For instance, on a recent Columbia Jazz
Masterpiece album, "1930's: The Jazz Singers," the one Crosby
track -- "Dinah," with the Mills Brothers -- is a short
course in the essentials of the jazz vocal. The instrumental
phrasing; the hot scat singing over the flowing vocal rhythm
section that was the Mills Brothers; and the last chorus on
which Bing sounds like a joyful, driving cornet.
   In addition, Columbia has assembled a three-LP (and CD)
set, "Bing Crosby/The Crooner/The Columbia Years 1928-1934."
Not all the numbers, by any means, are jazz pieces, but even
on the ballads there are touches of phrasing and rhythm that
indicate Crosby was never without -- in his head -- the
company of jazz musicians.
   The collection includes the most startling of all Crosby
recordings. "Brother Can You Spare a Dime?" is neither jazz
nor pop music. Yip Harburg and Jay Gorney's song is a
monologue by a veteran who, once cheered as a soldier, now is
down and out.
   Behind Crosby, the orchestra plays a slow, relentless
march, and he tells the story, from the breadline, with a
chilling bitterness that is wholly at odds with the blithe
Bing of the Kraft Music Hall, "Holiday Inn" and "High
Society." Yet, the serious Crosby, who knew something of
failure and loss, emerged again later in his career when he
compellingly played an alcoholic in the film version of
Clifford Odets's "The Country Girl."
   As for the light-hearted Crosby, still urbanely charming
and musically beyond fashion, there is a remarkable store of
rare Crosby radio broadcasts issued by a Crosby aficionado,
Larry Kiner. On his Spokane label, for example, there is
"Bing &amp; Dinah," composed largely of duets by Crosby and a
Dinah Shore who used to be a pretty fair jazz singer herself
on broadcasts by, as I remember, the Chamber Music Society of
Lower Basin Street. Her delightful, genuinely relaxed
rhythmic sense blends naturally with Crosby's.
   On Bing's "Music Hall Highlights" -- a selection from the
Kraft Music Hall programs -- Mr. Kiner has programmed a jazz
performance, "After You've Gone," and such other songs that
could have been written for Crosby as "It's Only a Paper
Moon" and "Moonlight Bay." Among the other albums in the
Spokane collection are: "Bing and Connee Boswell," "Bing &amp;
Bob Hope," a series of "Bing in the Thirties," and many more.
   While the sound is not state-of-the-1990s art, it's
listenable, and sometimes better than that. The albums are $7
plus $3 per order for shipping. That is, if 10 albums are
ordered, the shipping charge still would be $3. The address
is Nostalgia, P.O. Box 82, Redmond, Wash. 98073-0082.
   On the Kraft Music Hall sets, there are some of the breezy
Crosby spoken exchanges that used to add to the casual
surprises of that program. Listening then, I knew there were
writers on the show, but some of the wordplay seemed so
singularly Crosby's that I figured he must have often ad
libbed. During a 1976 interview, he confirmed that he had,
and I asked him about his pleasure in playing with words.
   "Well," he said, "I read a lot. I'm no intellectual, you
understand, but I like Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh,
Hemingway, John P. Marquand, Louis Auchincloss, and Simenon.
There's a great writer] Simenon writes mystery stories, but
he really understands character."
   Politically, Crosby was a conservative; the National
Review was one of his favorite publications. But unlike Bob
Hope, John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, he never so publicly
identified himself with a party's candidate that he appeared
to be endorsing him. "I never thought it was proper," Crosby
told me, "for a performer to use his influence to get anyone
to vote one way or another."
   There was, however, one political issue that he felt very
strongly about, and he might have said so publicly but he
couldn't figure out a way to make a difference. "I was
against the Vietnam War," he said, "but I didn't know what to
do about it."
   I asked if there was anything he hadn't done in all those
years that he still wanted to try. "No," Crosby said. "I
really have accomplished just everything I wanted to. It's
been a good life, pleasing people over so many years."
   And the recordings continue to bring pleasure. Mr. Kiner
is searching for more airchecks -- like the very early
broadcasts of the 1930s. There should be more of Crosby the
jazz singer in those programs. But then, all through his
career -- as in "High Society," with Louis Armstrong --
Crosby still remembered that six-piece kid band in Spokane,
with himself on drums.
