   Color Systems Technology Inc., Los Angeles, said it
completed a financial restructuring, giving its major
creditors a 40% stake in exchange for a reduction in debt.
   Color Systems said the agreement cut its debt to $7.4
million from $26.7 million. In exchange, the company will
issue about 3.5 million new common shares to its creditors,
including General Electric Co.'s General Electric Pension
Trust, U.S. Concord Inc., Equitable Lomas Leasing and
Leasetec Corp.

   Color Systems has been negotiating with creditors since
last year, after it defaulted on a loan with General Electric
Pension Trust. The trust took control of, and later sold,
Color Systems' 85-title film library.
   Buddy Young, president and chief executive officer of
Color Systems, cautioned that the future success of the
concern depends on the development and expansion of its
primary business of converting black-and-white film to color
videotape.
