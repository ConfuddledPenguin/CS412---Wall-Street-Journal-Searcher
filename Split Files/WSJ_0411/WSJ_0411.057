   BONN -- By endorsing an historic charter favoring
free-market principles, the Soviet Union and most East
European nations are showing just how eager they are to open
their economies to the West.
   The accord, adopted at a meeting of the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which ends
here today, commits East bloc countries to "endeavor to
achieve" things ranging from the protection of private
property and foreign investments to the creation of
convertible currencies and multiparty democracies.

   Rather than serving as a blueprint for the future, the
document is expected to become a tool -- even a weapon -- in
the hands of East bloc reformers.
   "Free-market reforms will encounter a great deal of
resistance and even setbacks in the future, so it's important
to give the reformers the ammunition they need to fight their
domestic battles," says Michael Silverman, a lawyer who
attended the conference as a private business representative
linked to the U.S. negotiating team. The new document will
provide this ammunition, he says, by giving reformers a set
of internationally recognized principles they can use to
press for changes, even in the face of foot-dragging by
bureaucrats.
   The document doesn't commit nations to specific changes,
emphasizing instead the broad principles that the
participants are expected to strive toward. The countries are
supposed to press for free and competitive economies in which
prices are determined by supply and demand, as well as for
fiscal and monetary policies that encourage growth. The
document also stresses the link between market economies and
democratic pluralism, suggesting that one can't function
without the other.
   Alan Holmer, head of the U.S. delegation, compares the
document to the 1975 Helsinki accords, a package of
principles for human rights endorsed by the CSCE and used
over the years by East bloc dissidents to press for political
change. "These principles may have no direct legal force,"
says Mr. Holmer, "but they do have strong moral and political
force."
   This is the first time the CSCE, an East-West forum
bringing together the U.S., Canada and all European nations
except Albania, has grappled directly with economic issues,
and highlights the importance now accorded to the 35-nation
group by many Western nations. U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker has said the forum, long dismissed in Washington as a
debating club, should now begin to acquire new functions in
East-West economic cooperation as well as in arms control.
   Against this background, the three-week meeting was marked
by a profound lack of serious conflict over basic principles.
Reformist ideas that might have seemed revolutionary in
countries such as Czechoslovakia or Bulgaria only a few
months ago are now widely accepted.
   Indeed, the East European nations seemed locked in a
competition to see who could most firmly embrace the ideals
of a market economy. This tone was set shortly after the
conference opened, when the Romanian delegation chief quoted
the top U.S. negotiator in calling for a less timid approach
to economic reforms. Czechoslovak Deputy Prime Minister
Vladimir Dlouhy, announcing that his country firmly supports
the final document, added only that it doesn't go far enough
toward integrating Europe.
   The charter is a hybrid of two documents, one from the
U.S., the other from the 12-member European Community. Both
called on Eastern countries to revamp their economies
according to Western principles, though the U.S. document was
more strident and listed specific principles. The EC's
approach was more pragmatic, emphasizing the need for
dependable economic statistics, rather than specific
free-market measures. In the end, the U.S. list was dropped,
but the ideas were melded into a compromise document.
   The only real problem was working through Moscow's
concerns. While not throwing up major roadblocks, the Soviets
resisted some elements of the package, such as the West's
call for unrestricted capital flows and the establishment of
property rights. Moscow also wanted more guarantees on social
welfare provisions.
   But even these concerns were relatively easy to allay by
toning down the Western proposals and inserting some of
Moscow's provisions. The Soviets, for instance, objected to
the term "free-market economy," preferring "market-oriented"
or "market-based economy." Ultimately, Moscow signed on to
the document, though some Western delegates said it might be
doing this more for the sake of harmony than out of genuine
conviction.
   "Many of the decisions and recommendations contained in
the Bonn document are in line with our philosophy of
perestroika and have a direct bearing on the economic renewal
in the Soviet Union," Stepan Sitarian, a Soviet deputy
premier, told the conference.
