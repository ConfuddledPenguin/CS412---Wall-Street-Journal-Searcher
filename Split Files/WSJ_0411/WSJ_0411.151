   Newell Co. said it owns a 5.6% stake in Lancaster Colony
Corp. and may try to take control of the Columbus, Ohio-based
specialty food, glassware and auto accessories company.
   Newell, a home-products concern in Freeport, Ill., said it
purchased the 675,000 shares for $20.47 a share, or $13.8
million.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Newell said it might seek representation on Lancaster
Colony's board, propose a merger, or seek control of the
company.
   Lancaster Colony, makers of products ranging from pasta
and salad dressing to car-floor mats and gun racks, said it
would fight any takeover attempt.
   John B. Gerlach, president of Lancaster Colony, said
Newell officials called him Monday to request a meeting. But
"we're not the least bit interested in talking," he said.
   Son of the company founder, Mr. Gerlach said he's the
largest shareholder, owning about 30% of Lancaster Colony's
11.8 million shares outstanding.
   Newell and its Anchor Hocking Corp. subsidiary have done
business with Lancaster. In 1986, Newell acquired Lancaster's
aluminum cookware division.
