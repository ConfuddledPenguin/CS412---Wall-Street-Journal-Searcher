   Scientists at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell
Laboratories have sharply shrunk the space taken up by the
company's new "photonic" technology, bringing the light-based
technology closer to uses in processing information.
   The development, to be announced today at an optical
computing conference in Kobe, Japan, shows that AT&amp;T
continues to make important progress in its drive toward
superfast data processing based on light rather than
electricity.

   AT&amp;T said it will unveil an experimental device that
combines the world's smallest lasers with a network of tiny
lenses and mirrors -- all on a quartz glass disk about one
inch in diameter and an eighth of an inch thick. Readily
made, the new device can be used to connect conventional
computer chips. Since it uses light, the resulting
connections carry more information and are faster than
ordinary electronic connections, said Tod Sizer, a Bell Labs
scientist.
   It has been known for some time that communicating with
light makes sense over long distances -- that's why telephone
companies use fiber-optic cables to transmit phone calls, for
example.
   But AT&amp;T has faced skepticism about its claims that light
is a practical way to communicate between computer chips at
distances as short as a few millimeters. And the company has
faced downright disbelief about its determination to develop
an all-optical computer -- one that would use light not just
to communicate, but to do calculations.
   The new device should quiet such criticism, Mr. Sizer
said. The device uses AT&amp;T's advanced "microlaser" technology
and a technique called diffractive optics, in which
microscopic lines that act as lenses and mirrors are etched
on quartz. This technology, which Mr. Sizer said is far more
stable and manufacturable than previous methods, will likely
play a large role in the company's optical computer.
   Indeed, sources said AT&amp;T is close to developing an
all-light computer processor -- one with very limited
abilities -- that fits on a piece of quartz the size of an
index card.
   That compares favorably with its last experimental set-up,
unveiled at the end of January: Hailed as a breakthrough, it
connected components on a lab bench using an unwieldy
collection of precision-mounted lasers, lenses, prisms and
mirrors.
   The advance evokes visions of a futuristic computer that
does its calculations by firing laser beams through a
specially manufactured block of quartz -- an image that
AT&amp;T's optical computer guru, Alan Huang, has said won't be
far from the truth.
   For the moment, however, Mr. Sizer said the technology
will likely be used to boost the performance of electronic
computers, especially supercomputers.
   AT&amp;T also said it will demonstrate the nascent
technology's first application to its core telecommunications
business -- a device that uses light to switch voice, data
and video signals -- next week in Atlanta.
