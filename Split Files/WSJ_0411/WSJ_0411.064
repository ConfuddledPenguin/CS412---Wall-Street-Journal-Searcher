   Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. are discussing a truce in
their comedy war that would merge their fledgling cable
networks, the Comedy Channel and HA]
   Although similar talks between the two sides have failed
before, both sides say discussions were renewed because the
two networks are struggling to gain subscribers and
advertisers at a time when there are only a limited number of
channels available on many cable systems, and a glut of new
cable networks competing for them.

   Executives and attorneys from both companies said Time and
Viacom are discussing a 50-50 joint venture in a single
comedy channel, or a venture that would include equity
investments by a group of cable operators.
   The merger discussions got an informal boost yesterday
when Viacom Chief Executive Frank Biondi and Time Warner
Co-Chief Executive Steven J. Ross met at the John Gardner
tennis resort in Scottsdale, Ariz., where they both were
vacationing. Neither could be reached for comment, but
executives at both companies said they had a friendly tennis
game.
   Friendly encounters between Viacom and Time these days are
rare. Even if there is enough demand for two competing cable
networks, Time and Viacom seem determined to thwart each
other at every turn. Earlier this week, for example, Time
threatened to take legal action to stop a transaction between
Viacom and a group of the nation's largest cable operators.
Viacom executives said the cable operators were prepared to
make equity investments in the HA] network and agree to
distribute it on cable systems serving about 20 million
subscribers, although not on an exclusive basis.
   The cable companies included Tele-Communications Inc. of
Denver, Continental Cablevision Inc. of Boston, Comcast Corp.
of Philadelphia, and the Cox Communications unit of Cox
Enterprises Inc. of Atlanta. Executives from
Tele-Communications, Continental, and Cox didn't return
calls. Comcast declined to comment.
   Time's Home Box Office unit, meanwhile, had been having
active discussions with some of the same and other cable
operators regarding an investment in its Comedy Channel. The
Comedy Channel premiered in November to a subscriber base of
only six million homes, and hasn't increased that base by
much.
   HA] premiered April 1 to a similarly small base of
subscribers, even though Viacom is giving cable operators the
option to run the comedy programming as the nighttime half of
Viacom's other cable channel, music video network VH-1, which
has about 38 million subscribers.
   A merger of the two comedy networks would link two of the
fiercest adversaries in the cable business in a marriage of
necessity. Viacom's Showtime Networks unit last May filed a
$2.5 billion antitrust suit against Home Box Office, charging
that HBO monopolizes the pay-television business. Viacom's
top executives, including Mr. Biondi and Showtime Chief
Executive Winston Cox, are former HBO executives, and have
become bitter rivals of their former colleagues at Time,
notably HBO Chief Executive Michael Fuchs. Mr. Fuchs declined
to comment yesterday.
   The talks about merging the two comedy networks apparently
don't necessarily include a settlement of the antitrust suit.
Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone decided to file that suit
last spring, and he continues to take a tough line against
HBO that may impede the merger of the two networks. In a
telephone interview yesterday, he said Viacom "was on the
verge of signing equity and distribution agreements with
cable operators, but they withdrew" under pressure from HBO.
Mr. Redstone said, "We and our attorneys are assiduously
considering all options," including filing a further
antitrust claim against Time and its HBO unit.
   Cable operators generally agree that a well-programmed
comedy network is an attractive programming asset, but they
say that there really isn't room for two. In an interview
last month, for example, Amos Hostetter, chairman and chief
executive officer of Continental Cablevision, said: "My sense
is only one of them will make it." HBO's Comedy Channel,
because it has been on much longer, has received the most
scrutiny, and hasn't gotten many good reviews; critics say
the network isn't very funny.
   If the two merge, the companies will have to agree on a
programming format. Both use original comedy programming and
stand-up comics, but they differ in other ways; HA] runs old
sitcoms in their entirety; the Comedy Channel uses snippets
from series and old movies. HA] acquired from NBC Productions
the exclusive off-network TV rights for the entire library of
"Saturday Night Live," more than 300 episodes from 1975
through the 1991 season.
