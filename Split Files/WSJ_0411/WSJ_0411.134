   HOUSTON -- A major oil company said it ordered the
construction of two crude tankers designed to help reduce the
chances of an oil spill.
   Conoco Inc., a unit of Du Pont Co., said it wanted the
tankers to be equipped with double hulls, even as new
regulations are being debated concerning the need for such
safety devices. Constantine S. Nicandros, Conoco's chief
executive officer, said the company was going ahead with its
plans regardless of the regulatory outcome.

   There is much debate over whether having two hulls would
have prevented the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska last
year, but requiring double-hull vessels nonetheless has been
the focus of tanker safety. Mr. Nicandros wouldn't disclose
the cost of the two tankers, but he said having two hulls
costs 15% more than a single-hull vessel.
   Most oil tankers have a single hull, or skin, to hold oil.
With two hulls, there is an extra layer of protection.
Depending on a tanker's size, it can easily cost $50 million
or more.
   Conoco, which operates several refineries, also said it
would attempt to reduce its toxic air emissions and hazardous
wastes by one-third over the next few years as part of a
broader environmental initiative. Initially, Mr. Nicandros
said the initiative would cost Conoco more than $50 million
annually.
