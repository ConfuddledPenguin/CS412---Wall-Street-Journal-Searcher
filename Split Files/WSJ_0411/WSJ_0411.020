   TRAFFIC JAMS OVER EUROPE

   Transport ministers of 23 European countries are to meet
in Paris on April 24 to approve an air-traffic-control
reorganization program. They hope the plan will partially
clear up the traffic jams in Europe's skies.
   The plan essentially would link by 1998 Europe's 42
air-traffic-control centers with high-speed data links that
carry radar and flight information. It is intended to squeeze
more capacity out of the fragmented, congested system and
prepare Europe for the drastic traffic increases forecast for
coming years.
   Proposed by the European Civil Aviation Conference, the
plan would reorganize air "lanes," provide for radar coverage
where it is lacking and harmonize standards for equipment and
operations.
   In a study, the International Air Transport Association
noted that the air-traffic problem could cost European
economies $9.5 billion annually by the end of the decade
unless significant improvements were made now.
                                                                                                       

   EC AID FOR CENTRAL AMERICA
                                                                                                       

   The European Community plans to increase its aid to
Central America by half. The EC's commissioner for Latin
America, Abel Matutes, said the EC Commission was earmarking
the extra funds for the region over the next two years. "We
plan an increase in funding in the order of 50% to 60%, which
demonstrates that events in Eastern Europe have in no way
prejudiced our obligations to the rest of the world," he
said. The EC now gives Central America about 100 million
European Currency Units ($120 million) a year.
                                                                                                       

   VISITING THE HOLY LAND

   Despite the continuing Palestinian uprising, as many as
45,000 tourists are expected to visit the Holy Land during
this Passover and Easter week, up 23% from last year,
Israel's Tourism Ministry said. One reason for the increase
is the coincidence of Easter this Sunday for both Orthodox
and Latin-rite churches.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S DIAL-A-BIRD SERVICE
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. and the
national Environment Agency now brings callers the sound of
birds over the telephone. "I will introduce you to the sound
of birds," coos a woman's soothing voice, describing each of
the birds featured on the tape. After the birds are heard,
the voice entreats the listener: "Please go out and try to
find real sounds yourself." NTT and the Environment Agency
say they hope to bring the Japanese closer to nature through
the new service, dubbed "Naku-naku 7979." Naku-naku means,
roughly, "Cheep-cheep."
                                                                                                       

   AIDS TEST FOR SINGAPORE MAIDS
                                                                                                       

   All new foreign housemaids must take a test for AIDS
before going to work in Singapore, the Labor Ministry said.
It said work permits would not be issued to maids who are
found to be infected with the AIDS virus; the test does not
apply to other foreign workers or maids already employed in
Singapore. About 190,000 foreigners work in Singapore, some
40,000 of whom are maids.
                                                                                                       

   BELGIUM'S SWINE PLAGUE
                                                                                                       

   A plan to stem an outbreak of swine plague in Belgium by
destroying 150,000 pigs ran into trouble yesterday when
officials were barred from collecting livestock in four
towns. For the second day, angry farmers blocked highways in
the affected areas, saying preventive killing of healthy pigs
would bankrupt them. The government has promised to refund
the full price of the pigs, but the offer was termed
insufficient by farmers, who say the cost to restart from
scratch is much higher than the proposed reimbursement.
                                                                                                       

   A COMMITMENT FROM FRANCE
                                                                                                       

   France has made a firm commitment to offer up to 1,500
passports to Hong Kong employees of French companies, and
other European countries will follow suit, a British
government minister said.
   Francis Maude, the British Foreign Office minister
responsible for Hong Kong, did not elaborate on the French
offer, which follows international lobbying by the British
government to secure foreign passports for residents of the
colony before it is handed back to China in 1997. But he told
a news conference that Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg were
completing plans to offer passports and added: "A number of
other European Community countries are actively considering
what they can do."
   China's bloody military suppression of the student-led
pro-democracy movement in Beijing last June rocked confidence
in Hong Kong and hastened plans by many professionals to
emigrate. Britain hopes that if Hong Kong people are given
foreign passports they will feel secure enough to stay.
   China has repeatedly attacked the British government's
plans, now before Parliament, to offer full British passports
to 50,000 Hong Kong residents and their families and has said
it would refuse to recognize the validity of the documents.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Animal-protection groups in the European Community are
urging organizers of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona to
leave bullfighting out of promotional activities. . . . In
Madrid, police arrested a West German tour-bus driver after
seizing 25.9 pounds of heroin hidden in the bus's
air-conditioning system. Authorities said the seizure
resulted from an anti-drug operation carried out in
cooperation with Dutch and West German police.
