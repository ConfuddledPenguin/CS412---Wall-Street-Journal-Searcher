   Yet another new member of the Nasdaq club got hammered as
investors shun OTC stocks that deliver earnings
disappointments.
   Sierra Tucson, an operator of treatment centers for drug
abusers and people with mental disorders, lost 4 3/4 to 7 1/2
after lowering its sights on this year's earnings. The
company went public less than a year ago for $12 a share.

   While Sierra Tucson was the worst hit OTC stock yesterday,
it joins a growing list of stocks with short track records
that have been dealt devasting blows by nervous investors in
recent weeks.
   Digital Sound, Pharmacy Management Services, and In-Store
Advertising are among those stocks that are trading well
below their initial public offering prices set earlier this
year.
   Most of those companies have not lived up to the
expectations set during their offerings, and have paid dearly
as a result. Traders say there is little tolerance for
uncertainty in a market where even the best and the brightest
have lost their shine.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.10 points, or 0.81%, to
378.68. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index took a
bigger hit, dropping 1.4%.
   Tony Cecin, director of equity trading at Piper Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, says Nasdaq dealer stock inventories are the lowest
that he has seen them in 10 years. That means OTC market
makers aren't willing to hold stock for long, and any shares
for sale will drive the stock price lower until a buyer is
found.
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 796 to 1,015, while
volume fell to 106.3 million shares from 118.1 million shares
Wednesday.
   Piper Jaffray's Mr. Cecin says he won't feel comfortable
buying stocks until the market is much lower.
   He says that even if the Middle East crisis were settled
today and the Dow industrials rallied 150 points, there would
still be plenty of investors ready to sell their shares --
leading to another slide.
   "I would feel more comfortable about stepping in at 2,200
{on the Dow Jones Industrial Average} than at 2,450," he
says. The DJIA closed at 2,593.32, down 39.11 points
yesterday.
   Sierra Tucson's stock has lost more than half of its value
since Tuesday. Wednesday afternoon, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst
Carl Sherman told his sales force and trading desk that
Sierra Tucson wouldn't meet his 1990 earnings projections,
traders of the stock say.
   Mr. Sherman lowered his 1990 projection to 73 cents a
share from an earlier range of 90 cents to 95 cents a share.
   Word of Mr. Sherman's views spread quickly, sparking a
sell-off that sent Sierra Tucson's stock plunging 4 points to
12 1/4 before the trading was halted late Wednesday.
   Later that day, Sierra Tucson announced that its new
German operations aren't going to break out of the red as
early as the company had hoped. Sierra opened a treatment
center in Germany late in 1989, but has yet to turn a profit
there.
   As a result, the company said profit for the third quarter
will fall below the 20 cents a share earned in the period
last year.
   "It's a timing issue," said Sierra Tucson's Chief
Financial Officer John Schmitz. "We made a mistake in terms
of projecting when we will break even" in Germany.
   Mr. Schmitz says the company now expects the German
operations to pass the break-even point early next year -- by
February at the latest. But Mr. Schmitz is dismayed by the
violent market reaction to the company's news.
   "The reaction is a little more negative than it needs to
be," he says of the decline in the company's stock. Even at
73 cents a share, Sierra Tucson's 1990 profit will have grown
15% year-over-year.
   Intel led the most-active list, falling 1 7/8 to 33 1/8 on
volume of more than two million shares. At least part of that
move was because of jitters over the impact of a patent
granted to a California-based inventor that could cover many
of the chips made by the semiconductor industry. This
newspaper reported that if the patent survives challenges,
chip-makers like Intel might have to fork over millions in
royalties.
   MCI Communications rose 7/8 to 32 5/8. In a meeting
Wednesday, the company assured Wall Street analysts that
their 1991 earnings estimates of $3.20 to $3.45 a share were
reasonable. That would translate into revenue growth of as
much as 20% for 1991, an MCI spokesman told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Sunrise Medical added 1/2 to 14 1/4 after reporting that
it earned 40 cents a share on a fully diluted basis in its
fourth quarter ended in June, up from 32 cents a share in the
quarter last year.
   Envirosafe Services tumbled 4 7/8, or about 32%, to 10
3/8. The Ohio Hazardous Waste Facility Board denied an
application by one of the company's principal units to
construct an additional waste-disposal site in Ohio.
