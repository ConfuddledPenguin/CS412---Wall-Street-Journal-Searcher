   NEW YORK -- Program trading soared to 13.9% of New York
Stock Exchange volume, or 20.5 million shares a day, in the
week ended Aug. 17 -- the third-heaviest program volume so
far this year.
   That was up from 7.8% of average daily Big Board volume
the prior week.

   In its regular tally of the computer-aided trading
strategies, the exchange said "buy" programs accounted for
8.7 million shares of program volume and "sell" programs for
11.8 million, during a week in which the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell 71.78 points, or 2.6%.
   The Aug. 17 week included the expiration of stock options
and stock-index options. The only heavier program-trading
weeks this year both included the market's quarterly "triple
witching" days, in which stock-index futures also expire in
addition to options. Those were the week ended March 16 (when
programs accounted for 16.5% of volume) and the week ended
June 15 (22.3%).
   Biggest program traders for the week ended Aug. 17,
accounting for 72% of the total, were Morgan Stanley Group
Inc. (30.2 million shares), PaineWebber Group Inc. (19.2
million), Susquehanna Investment Group (10.2 million),
General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. (9.5 million)
and CS First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp. (4.8 million).
   Kidder's volume was less than in past weeks, when its
activity allowed it to regain its rank as No. 1 program
trader on the exchange.
   Program trading is the purchase or sale of a group of from
15 to as many as hundreds of different stocks valued at at
least $1 million. Its most popular form, stock-index
arbitrage, involves multistock trades with offsetting trades
in futures and options. For the latest week, Morgan,
Susquehanna and Kidder accounted for 66% of all index
arbitrage volume.
