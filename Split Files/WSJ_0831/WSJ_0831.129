   EECO Inc., Santa Ana, Calif., said it filed a plan of
reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana
that calls for satisfying creditors by continuing to sell off
non-core businesses.
   EECO, which sought bankruptcy-law protection in May, said
it hopes to sell its hotel reservations systems business in
the next 60 to 90 days. The company sold its Maxi-Switch
computer keyboard division this month to Silitek, a
Taiwan-based electronics concern.

   George B. DeHuff, EECO president and chief executive
officer, said the company hopes the court will approve the
reorganization plan by year's end. The restructured EECO will
continue to manufacture electromechanical switches and
electronic keypads in the U.S. and electromechanical switches
and keyboards in Scotland.
