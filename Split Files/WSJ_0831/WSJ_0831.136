   HONG KONG -- The Canadian and Hong Kong groups who agreed
last month to buy Columbia Savings &amp; Loan's $3 billion
junk-bond portfolio may back out of the deal if the U.S.
economy deteriorates further.
   In an interview, a top official connected with the
purchase said the buyers, who consist of three groups
controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Gordon
Investment Corp., became concerned about the transaction when
the Persian Gulf crisis erupted.

   "We are monitoring the situation very closely," said
Richard Li, son of the tycoon and managing director of the
corporate fund management committee of Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., a company controlled by the family. "We are aware of
our options and would exploit our options if necessary."
   Mr. Li said his group and Gordon Investment have until
Oct. 2 to decide whether to go through with the purchase and
would make the decision together.
   He said if the decision were made today, they would go
through with the deal. But he added they would back out if it
appeared that the U.S. economy would weaken to the point
where the bond issuers couldn't meet their obligations.
   The groups wouldn't face any penalty if they were to scrap
the agreement by the deadline, he said.
   Terms of the definitive agreement give the purchaser the
right to pull out or to renegotiate the transaction under
certain circumstances, such as a general collapse of the
junk-bond market or if hostilities break out involving either
the U.S. or Canada. The agreement specifically provides that
if the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Fund Index declines by 7.5%
or more the day before the transaction is to close, the
groups would probably be entitled to scrap the transaction.
   As recently as early this week, people close to Columbia
continued to be cautiously optimistic that the transaction
would be completed. The agreement was recently cleared by
Columbia's board. The company is expected next week to send
out proxy materials for a special shareholders meeting Sept.
18 to vote on the sale. Terms of the agreement also call for
federal regulatory approval to be received by Sept. 20.
   Late last month, the Li group said it would buy half of
Columbia's portfolio of junk bonds, believed to be the
largest held by any U.S. savings-and-loan, by taking a 50%
stake in a partnership owned by Gordon Investment, which had
just agreed to acquire the portfolio. Hutchison, a Hong Kong
conglomerate, and sister company Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd.,
a real estate group, each agreed to take 20% in the venture,
with a company closely held by the elder Mr. Li taking the
remaining 10%.
   Together with Gordon Investment, a Toronto merchant bank,
the Li group agreed to pay $300 million to acquire the
portfolio and finance the remaining 90% on a nonrecourse
basis at 10.5% interest. That means that the partnership
could drop the portfolio if its losses exceed the down
payment, and Columbia would have to accept it back.
