   SEOUL, South Korea -- At a time when South Korea's stock
market desperately needs a shot in the arm, the government's
latest remedy only made matters worse.
   Seoul officials proposed legislation Thursday that would
ease restrictions on corporate shareholdings, encourage more
stock buying by small-scale and individual investors, and
allow listed companies to pay semiannual dividends. They also
decided to complete funding of the four trillion-won ($5.59
billion) Stock Market Stabilization Fund in an effort to pump
more liquidity into the market.

   But in what has become a familiar scenario on the Seoul
market, investors disappointed by news reports of the
proposals responded with a sell-off that ended a three-day
rally in which shares recovered an average 10% on signs of an
easing of tensions in the Persian Gulf crisis. The composite
index fell 20.92 points, or 3.2%, to 626.85. Trading volume
totaled about 16.1 million shares, compared with about 22.6
million shares Wednesday. Losses outnumbered gains 749 to 68.
   The market reaction underscored two points on which nearly
all securities analysts agree: The problems of the Korean
market are so complex and deeply ingrained that recovery is
going to take many months, and that investors lack confidence
in the government's ability to rectify the situation.
   "I'm afraid that we haven't seen the worst yet," said an
analyst for Ssangyong Investment &amp; Securities Co., one of the
nation's biggest brokerage houses.
   The lack of confidence and resulting frustration, shown
repeatedly in recent months by angry investors protesting in
the streets, reached a high level last week when the
composite index fell below 600 -- 40% off its peak of 1007,
in April 1989.
   The market's 16-month plunge has bankrupted many small
investors and crippled most securities dealers. According to
Ssangyong, Korean investors lost more than 17.3 trillion won
on plummeting shares during the first seven months of this
year -- more than 60% of that sustained by individual
investors.
   The Korea Securities Dealers Association warns that some
of the nation's 25 brokerage houses are in serious trouble.
The association's managing director, Kim Tae-Cheon, says 90%
of the firms' domestic branch offices didn't meet their daily
average break-even sales level of 10 billion won in July, and
have done even worse this month.
   But few see much hope of a remedy for any of the market's
central problems in the near future. "Apart from the Gulf
development in the past few days," says a Seoul manager for
Jardine Fleming Securities Co., "nothing has changed in the
fundamentals that will affect the market for many months."
   Still, there are some things the Korea Securities Dealers
Association believes the government can and must do to
prevent a total collapse of the market. The association's Mr.
Kim says such measures include expanding share demand by
loosening monetary controls, changing legislation that
restricts pension-fund managers from investing in equities,
and increasing the Stock Market Stabilization Fund.
   The government addressed two of those points in the
legislative proposals, namely revisions of pension-fund laws
and a full vesting of the stabilization fund. The fund was
authorized earlier this year to help the market by providing
soft loans mainly to institutional investors, but it has yet
to be completely capitalized.
   The government remains determined, however, not to ease
monetary controls, for fear of fueling inflation, which
already is running at a 10-year high of 7%.
