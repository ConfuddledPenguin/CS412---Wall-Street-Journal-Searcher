   LOS ANGELES -- The squeeze play is on at Dodger Stadium.

   The Dodgers face the possibility of a second straight fall
in attendance, and owner Peter O'Malley must balance that
against swelling team salaries -- his single biggest cost, as
it is for most baseball teams.
   Worrying about Mr. O'Malley's 1990 profit is like fretting
that Babe Ruth might bash only 50 home runs. The Dodgers have
more season ticket holders than the whole crowd at an average
major-league game. That means an interest-bearing $17 million
cushion even before opening day. By some estimates, even with
slowing turnstiles and a $22 million team payroll that is
baseball's sixth largest, the Dodgers could still earn a tidy
$6 million before taxes, perhaps trailing only a New York
Yankee machine oiled by a unique cable-TV pact.
   Management Prof. Gerald Scully, author of "The Business of
Major League Baseball," lists the Dodgers as the game's top
moneymaker of the 1980s -- and owner of a 25% pretax profit
margin in 1982 that could well be a record for any sport. "I
doubt seriously you could buy the franchise if you wrote them
a check for $250 million," he says.
   In everything from profit to stadium maintenance, says
Milwaukee Brewers owner Allan H. Selig, "I think the Dodgers
are the prototype of how a franchise should be run." So Mr.
O'Malley's defense against his squeeze play gets special
attention among the 25 other major league teams.
   At the heart of the O'Malley strategy is an effort to
increase production of young players from its system of
minor-league farm clubs, which can replace million-dollar
players with guys making the $100,000 minimum. He has potent
marketing tools as well. Like his father, the late Walter
O'Malley, a flamboyant character who boldly moved a
prosperous franchise to this then-uncharted baseball
territory in 1958, son Peter makes a religion of wooing fans
with low-priced tickets and ingenious stadium promotions.
   The biggest boost would be a late-season pennant drive to
restore Dodger Stadium as a field of dreams. Attendance in
the 1980s thrived on two world championships and four Western
Division titles -- baseball's top performance -- and the
popularity of such stars as Steve Garvey, Steve Sax, Fernando
Valenzuela and Orel Hershiser. And after a lackluster early
season, fans see in the second-place team's recent move on
Cincinnati the glimmer of another miracle like its Cinderella
World Series win in 1988.
   But the Dodgers have had difficulties growing and keeping
their own stars recently. "Winning in '88 was the worst thing
that could have happened to the Dodgers," says Ken Gurnick,
who covers the Dodgers for The National, a sports newspaper.
He believes the success of the '88 team, short on
farm-developed players, masked faults in amateur-player
drafting that had long been a Dodger strength.
   Over the past few years, the Dodgers have tried to win by
acquiring such expensive major league talent as Eddie Murray
($2.5 million a year) and Kirk Gibson, Hubie Brooks, Juan
Samuel and Alfredo Griffin ($1 million-plus each). Mr.
O'Malley, though, predicts an end to what he calls "the
interruption in the pipeline" from the farms.
   A highly paid professional staff works for the Dodger
owner, one of only a few in baseball who also serve as team
president. "I don't have to be an expert on taxes,
split-fingered fastballs or labor relations with our ushers.
That talent is all available," says the 52-year-old Mr.
O'Malley, whose flesh-tone eyeglass frames symbolize his
aversion to glitz.
   His presence pervades the team's marketing to fans. Cable
and broadcast income has risen sharply, but people in the
stands still provide the bulk of revenue for the Dodgers and
most other teams. One estimate puts Dodger game receipts,
concessions and parking -- a big item for the O'Malley-owned
stadium -- at more than $40 million this year, about twice
its broadcasting revenue.
   And at this meticulously maintained park, price-conscious
Dodger marketers figure they compete in an environment that
pits their product against Disneyland or the beach. Mr.
O'Malley points proudly to a study rating a family outing
here as the cheapest in baseball -- fully $20 below either
Yankee or Met games.
   His devotion to cheap tickets shows up after season's end,
when prices generally rise only if the "worst-case scenario"
for next year indicates a loss at the old amounts. Last year,
the price of every seat went up -- to $9 for a box. Despite
huge waiting lists for season tickets in past years, Mr.
O'Malley won't sell over 27,000 for fear of squeezing out the
average fan.
   Fans here get baseball's most elaborate promotional push,
usually tied to a traditional theme -- this year the team is
celebrating its 100th anniversary in the National League.
Along with cap nights and the like, the team has offered six
"commemorative pin" giveaways this year, as well as
baseball-card events at which fans collect 1,100 cards in all
-- one for every Dodger whose picture could be found. One
thing the fans don't get is billboards. Gesturing to the
field outside his office, Mr. O'Malley calls it "the most
under-signed stadium in the nation, maybe the world,"
claiming he leaves "a million dollars a year on the table" to
keep it that way.
   Mr. O'Malley, who studied economics at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for a time ran a struggling
Dodger farm team. "You learn a lot in seventh place," he
says, "a lot more than you learn in first place."
   But he's been on top plenty since becoming the Dodger
chief in 1970 -- thanks largely to the prodigious farm
system. That minor-league contribution was most obvious in
1982. The team, reigning world champions, was made up mainly
of popular, home-grown stars and drew a record 3.6 million
fans. Also contributing was the phenomenon of
"Fernandomania," which swelled attendance at Dodger Stadium
each time the charismatic Mexican-born Mr. Valenzuela took
the mound in this heavily Latino city.
   The current crew, though, is mainly an expensive patchwork
of journeymen stitched together by general manager Fred
Claire. Formerly the Dodger publicity chief, Mr. Claire got
his new job after 18-year-veteran Al Campanis opined in a
1987 network TV interview that blacks lacked natural ability
to be field managers -- a view particularly embarrassing to
the team that broke baseball's "color line" 40 years earlier.
An early Claire find was Kirk Gibson, formerly of Detroit,
who led the Dodgers to the '88 world championship and is best
remembered for limping to the plate injured to snatch the
first game from heavily favored Oakland with a dramatic
ninth-inning home run.
   Poor showings by other newly acquired players knocked the
team from contention in 1989, and the Dodgers were devastated
early this year by the loss of star pitcher Orel Hershiser to
arm surgery.
   Mr. O'Malley says faith in the farms -- and in a Dominican
Republic academy that is the envy of other teams -- remain
the Dodger "cornerstone." The newest Dodger called up,
much-heralded shortstop Jose Offerman, is a product of
Dominican baseball-diamond mines, as is rookie pitching
sensation Ramon Martinez, who has picked up some of the slack
left by Mr. Hershiser's absence. Minor-league operations
director Charlie Blaney swears "things are bright down on the
farm," where his teams now have baseball's best record. He
believes farm-bred players may be starting at every position
for the Dodgers in three years.
   Robert Graziano, the Dodger financial vice president,
banks on it. "If you have a strong farm system, you can bring
players up with relatively low salaries," he says. Still,
rebuilding means trouble, too, if fans must wait for a
winner. "We're concerned about the season ticket holders
after two losing years, especially if you have to raise the
prices on them," he says. Some in the Dodger organization
expect a few higher-paid Dodger players to be dropped next
year -- meaning 13-year manager Tom Lasorda will have to
break in several rookie starters. But that could spare fans a
ticket price rise.
   Whatever decisions are made, Peter O'Malley expects to
make them.
   The team isn't for sale; he doesn't even counter the
several serious offers he gets for the club each year. But he
suspects corporate ownership, in general, is baseball's
future, as only big companies that can use the promotional
value the teams offer will be able to absorb the low return
on investment of the average franchise. Mr. O'Malley, who
isn't sure if any of his children would want to take over
eventually, says one thing he wouldn't miss about the team is
what he calls baseball's biggest problem: "the total
inability of the two sides to figure out a way to coexist
peacefully" in player-management negotiations.
   For now, though, he still has fun. The game is "his whole
life," says Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent. "He lives,
eats and breathes baseball."
   In the stadium president's box, Mr. O'Malley chats with
VIP guests about his "hobby" -- globetrotting on behalf of
the game. "The next decade will be the decade of the passport
in baseball," he says, expecting the U.S. to see many more
foreign players in the future. The 1992 Olympics should
provide a special boost. His international efforts could give
the Dodgers a long-term edge in recruiting foreign talent.
   But will Los Angeles fans -- known as an impatient lot --
rebel if the farm system doesn't produce a winner soon?
"We're never going to know, because it won't happen," Mr.
O'Malley answers, swearing he'll even go into the red to buy
talent if he must. "We'll do whatever it takes to win."
