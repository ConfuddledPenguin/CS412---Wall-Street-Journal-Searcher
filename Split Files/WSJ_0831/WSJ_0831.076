   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp., bouyed by
orders for power-generation equipment, will achieve
double-digit per-share earnings growth this year despite the
sluggish economy, Paul E. Lego, chairman and chief executive,
said.
   Mr. Lego said he "wouldn't take exception" with analysts'
estimates that Westinghouse will earn about $3.48 a share
this year. That would compare with 1989 net of $922 million,
or $3.15 a share, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid on May 5.
Sales in 1989 were $12.84 billion.

   For the first six month of 1990, Westinghouse earned $462
million, or $1.57 a share, on sales of $6 billion.
   "So far, we feel our projections are attainable," Mr. Lego
said in an interview, despite the fact that the gross
national product growth has been below 2% for the past five
quarters. More than a year ago, Westinghouse officials
forecast that the company would have double-digit per-share
earnings growth this year and 10% operating margins if GNP
growth was in the 2% to 2.5% range.
   Mr. Lego said the electrical-equipment industry, which
also includes General Electric Co. and Emerson Electric Co.,
has "come down faster than the S&amp;P and Dow Jones averages
have" since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   He said the slide probably stems from investors' fears
that such companies will be hurt by capital spending cutbacks
during an uncertain economic period. But the executive said
Westinghouse might benefit in some segments because customers
"tend to repair existing equipment during tight economic
times."
   Despite a slowdown in the construction industry, for
instance, Westinghouse's electrical-parts distribution
business "is still doing well," Mr. Lego said.
   If anything, the executive said Westinghouse may benefit
longer term as a result of concerns raised by the Iraq
situation. For example, he said, rekindled interest in
alternative energy sources could help speed up a revival of
the company's nuclear power plant business. Westinghouse
hasn't had a domestic order to build a nuclear plant in more
than a decade. But it has worked on new designs anticipating
a resurgence of nuclear power by the turn of the century.
   Mr. Lego, who took over the top job at Westinghouse
earlier this summer, also said the military callup prompted
by the Iraq situation might force Congress to consider
rebuilding the nation's nuclear weapons complex. If so, he
said, Westinghouse might stand to benefit from designing and
building reactors and other facilities to produce nuclear
materials.
   Recently, Westinghouse lost a $1.5 billion contract to
design a reactor for the government. Ebasco Services Inc., a
subsidary of Enserch Corp., won the contract. But Mr. Lego
said Westinghouse may be able to participate in that project
because the company manages the Savannah River, S.C.,
facility where the reactor is slated to be built.
Westinghouse also manages other government facilities and is
involved in cleanup of radioactive and other wastes at those
sites.
   Meanwhile, Westinghouse continues to benefit from a surge
in orders for power-generation equipment. Mr. Lego said that
market is growing at an annual rate of 10% to 15%, and that
Westinghouse's sales are growing at about double that rate.
   Most of the orders for turbines and other equipment have
come from independent power producers who will sell power to
electrical utilities. Mr. Lego said the business is
performing better than expected and has an order backlog of
about $1 billion. "There isn't any indication of a slowdown
at all," he said.
   Mr. Lego added that Europe presents "lots of opportunities
for us in the service areas." In particular, he said,
Westinghouse is well-positioned to upgrade nuclear power
plants and electric power systems. "In order for those
economies to expand, they have to have electricity," he said.
   In the U.S., Mr. Lego said the most noticeable impact of
the economic slowdown has been at the company's Group W
broadcasting unit where television station revenues have
slumped. He said that some regional markets, especially the
Northeast, have softened and that auto makers also have
pulled back advertising. But some of that TV revenue decline
has been offset by better than expected results at the
group's radio stations, he said.
   Mr. Lego also said that orders for truck refrigeration
units "haven't been as strong as we would have liked them to
have been." The company's Thermo King over-the-road
refrigeration business "is still doing well," he said, but it
has been hurt as customers have been pinched by tight credit
and increased fuel costs.
   Mr. Lego said the company's financial-services business
has been hurt by the slump in the real estate market. But he
said that business "will do better this year than it did last
year. So far, it's holding its own."
   He said the company's community development business
"hasn't slowed at all. We haven't seen any major downturn."
But he expects some scaling back in development of shopping
centers or strips within such communities.
