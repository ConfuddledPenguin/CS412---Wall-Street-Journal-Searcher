million of its common shares, or 11% of its stock

   The cash and stock represent the second half of a two-part
payment agreement between Texas Industries and Co-Steel. In
1985, Co-Steel sold its 50% stake in Chaparral Steel to Texas
Industries for $42 million plus a payment to be based on
Chaparral's performance in fiscal 1986 through 1990.
   The agreement called for the stock part of the payment to
be placed in a five-year trust starting in 1990. During the
five years, Texas Industries will retain voting rights, as
well as first-refusal rights to purchase the shares if
Co-Steel decides to sell them. The shares increase Co-Steel's
Texas Industries stake to more than 20%.
