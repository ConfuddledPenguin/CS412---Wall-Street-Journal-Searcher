   Our government has not lost
   Its sound, proficient ways
   In these most adverse, trying
   Census-taking days.
   And I'm impelled to praise it
   With silly prose and rhymes,
   For I have now been counted
   No less than five times.
   -- Dalton L. Nevels.

   A little liquor, and you lose inhibitions;
   A lot of liquor, and you give exhibitions.
