   HONG KONG -- Cathay Pacific Airways said first-half profit
rose 4.4%, but the airline warned that the Persian Gulf
crisis will likely hurt results for the rest of the year.
   The Hong Kong-based airline said profit rose to 1.42
billion Hong Kong dollars (US$182.7 million), or 49.5 Hong
Kong cents a share, from HK$1.36 billion, or 47.6 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 13% to HK$9.36 billion
from HK$8.26 billion.

   Cathay's board proposed keeping its interim dividend at
10.5 cents.
   D.A. Gledhill, the group's chairman, said results were
hurt by the colony' slowdown in tourism and labor shortages.
He said second-half results are expected to be hurt by higher
energy costs and a likely fall in demand for passenger and
cargo services. That could lead to the full-year profit
dropping below last year's HK$3.32 billion, he said.
   Virtually the entire rise in first-half earnings was
accounted for by a lower tax bill compared with the same
period a year earlier, as operating costs were inflated by
higher expenses for personnel and fuel. On a pretax basis,
profit was virtually unchanged at HK$1.6 billion from HK$1.59
billion.
   The group was particularly hard-hit by a sixfold rise in
net finance charges to HK$154 million from HK$25 million, as
weak bond markets resulted in a lower return on its invested
funds.
   Cathay said it suffered marginally lower load factors for
both passengers and cargo, although its flight capacity rose
briskly because of four aircraft acquired in the first six
months, which brought its total fleet to 40 aircraft.
   While the airline carried 14% more passengers and 6% more
cargo than a year ago, these gains were offset by higher
operating costs, the company said.
