   TOKYO -- Osaka Gas Co., Japan's second-largest gas
supplier, said it established a subsidiary, Osaka Gas America
Inc., in Pasadena, Calif., as the base for its activities in
North America.
   The new company is capitalized at $3 million. It is owned
50% by Osaka Gas and 50% by its wholly owned subsidiaries. It
will export products and materials to its parent and
affiliates in Japan, and market Osaka Gas products in North
America.
