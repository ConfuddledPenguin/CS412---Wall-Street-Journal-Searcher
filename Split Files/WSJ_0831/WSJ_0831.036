   STOUGHTON, Mass. -- Reebok International Ltd. yesterday
said it was "proud" to announce that it had landed a contract
with Soviet "tennis sensation" Alexander Volkov to promote
its shoes and clothes.
   On Wednesday, Reebok crowed, Mr. Volkov had scored a
"major upset" at the U.S. Open by beating top seed Stefan
Edberg. Mr. Volkov will "help Reebok become a household name
in the Soviet Union," the company added.

   Reebok, however, was running one step slow: Mr. Volkov's
upset victory was on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he was flattened
at the U.S. Open by Todd Witsken, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3.
   Company officials couldn't be reached for comment.
