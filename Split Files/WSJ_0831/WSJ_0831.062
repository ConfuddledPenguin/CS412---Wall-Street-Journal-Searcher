   BANK OF NEW YORK (New York) -- Moody's Investor Service
Inc. said it lowered the ratings on long-term bond issues
supported by this subsidiary of Bank of New York Co. The
action affects $357.4 million in issues. The downgrade
follows by a day Moody's downgrade of $1.2 billion of the
parent company's long-term debt. Moody's said it lowered the
ratings of 14 transactions supported by the bank's letters of
credit to single-A-1 from Aa-3. The ratings apply only to
those letter of credit-backed issues carrying long-term
ratings, primarily industrial development bond issues,
Moody's said. Moody's cited the bank's exposure in loans for
highly leveraged transactions in its downgrading.
