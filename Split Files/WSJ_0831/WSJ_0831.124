   Stocks of ocean shipping companies have sprung a leak,
punctured by hostilities in the Persian Gulf. At today's
low-in-the-water prices, they offer large potential rewards,
several astute money managers say.
   The marine transportation component of the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index sank 20% in the three weeks after Iraq
invaded Kuwait. Despite a partial recovery, it still is down
13% since the Aug. 2 invasion and 28% since year end.
Recession fears and concern about oil-spill liability had
hurt the group even before the Gulf crisis began.

   Lately, the biggest damage has been suffered by stocks of
companies that operate big oil tankers. But they also have
the potential for the sharpest recovery, some analysts and
money managers say. A leading example is Nortankers, based in
Norway but owned mainly by U.S. investors and traded on the
American Stock Exchange. From a January high of 15 3/4,
Nortankers has sunk 53%, to 7 3/8 yesterday.
   Other ocean shippers, such as OMI Corp. and Overseas
Shipholding Group, have lost 10% to 30% of their market value
since late July and could also represent bargains for brave
purchasers.
   To be sure, these stocks are risky. People who want to buy
low and sell high generally need to buy when the news is
frightening, and it's certainly scary now. One big worry:
Iraq could bomb oil fields in Saudi Arabia, disrupting
production and leaving carriers without much oil to carry.
   Short of that, there's still plenty to fret about. The
Gulf crisis has driven up insurance costs on voyages to and
from the Middle East, and fuel costs on all voyages. The loss
of Kuwaiti and Iraqi cargoes has idled some tankers and
thrown the industry into temporary overcapacity. A recession
in the U.S. could cause oil usage, or international trade in
general, to flatten or decrease.
   But at today's prices, ocean shipping stocks already have
reflected a lot of bad news, advocates say. One big buyer has
been the Fidelity family of mutual funds, particularly the
Fidelity Capital Appreciation Fund and Fidelity Select
Transportation Fund.
   Rick Mace, who runs the transportation fund and follows
shipping stocks for all the Fidelity funds, is a staunch
advocate of the stocks, especially OMI, Overseas Shipholding
Group, Nortankers, International Shipholding Group and MC
Shipping. Fidelity owns 14.5% of Nortankers, close to 13% of
OMI, and about 10% of the other three. It has added to its
positions on the recent weakness.
   Mr. Mace lays out his case as follows: "The resolution of
the Gulf crisis is unclear," he says. "But it's reasonable to
expect that the Gulf countries will continue to produce oil,
and that Europe and the U.S. and the Far East will continue
to consume oil. That will require transportation. And the
mode of transportation will probably be tankers."
   There are only some 413 very large crude carriers (VLCCs)
in the world, Mr. Mace says. (That figure also includes the
behemoths known as ultra large crude carriers.) Many of them
are owned by closely held companies, or by companies whose
stock can be purchased only in Scandinavia. In the U.S. stock
market, the only "pure play" in big oil tankers is
Nortankers, which owns four of them.
   Such ships can carry 2.5 million barrels of oil and cost
around $100 million to build. While some new ones are on
order, the fleet is expanding only about 5% a year, Mr. Mace
figures. Most of today's VLCCs are getting old, having been
built in 1974-1976.
   But "the shipping play is not restricted to VLCCs," Mr.
Mace says. Increasing U.S. exports of coal and other dry bulk
cargos could give a boost to several shipping companies.
"It's a very exciting field because the shipping cycles are
long-term," he says. "A 10-year trend is not unusual." U.S.
shippers were about three years into a cyclical recovery
before the Gulf crisis hit.
   Jay Charles Goodgal, a money manager in Paterson, N.J.,
likes the entire shipping group, but especially Nortankers.
"Should (Nortankers') ships get blown out of the water, each
is insured for 115% of appraised value. This equates to a
value for the company of approximately $20 per share net of
debt," or nearly triple the recent stock price, he says.
   Mr. Goodgal and others don't recommend the stock for
short-term traders. But Mr. Goodgal says long-term investors
have time on their side, because world economies depend on
Mideast oil.
   William Baker, who manages the Directors Fund and some
other funds at Oppenheimer Management Corp. in New York,
holds 160,000 shares of Nortankers. "It's so stupid that this
thing is at seven bucks," he says. "It's just irrational
pricing."
   Even so, he thinks the stock could go even lower in a
general market decline. If it does, he plans to add to
holdings; otherwise, he simply plans to hold on. "I assume
we're going into a recession," he says. But after that, he
expects the tanker market to improve and Nortankers to rise
to above 20.
   Not everyone wants to invest in crude oil carriers, of
course. James L. Winchester, analyst with Mabon Nugent, says
it's too soon for that, with the Mideast so unsettled. He
prefers B&amp;H Maritime, which transports dry bulk cargo and
refined petroleum products, and Anangel-American
Shipholdings, a British dry bulk cargo carrier traded in the
U.S. over the counter.
   But Michael C. Young, oil analyst at Smith Barney, thinks
investors should take the plunge on Nortankers. Even if oil
fields in the Mideast are destroyed, he says, "any damage . .
. is going to be very short term. Iraq does not have the
capacity to do permanent damage to the Saudi fields. It's
been proven that you can rebuild oil facilities that have
been bombed" in a matter of weeks.
   Though the U.S. may try to increase its own production as
well as imports from non-Mideast nations such as Venezuela
and Canada, in the long run the Mideast is where the reserves
are, Mr. Young says. "The world is depending on Saudi Arabia
to increase output to make up for Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil," Mr.
Young says. "That crude is going to have to be moved by
VLCCs." And Saudi oil is "by definition the longest-haul
crude in the world." Tankers are paid not only by the ton,
but by the mile.
