   NEW YORK -- The Missouri State Board of Accountancy said
it is revoking the certification of James W. Checksfield, a
St. Louis accountant who doubled as an informant for the
Internal Revenue Service.
   In a harshly worded statement, the board said Mr.
Checksfield's action is "not only at odds with the role of
the CPA but acts to undermine the very foundation of the
professional relationship" between an accountant and client.
The board further added that "such duplicity cannot and will
not be condoned."

   Mr. Checksfield's case was the subject of a front-page
story in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. It raised
questions about confidentiality of information that clients
provide accountants and whether accountants should use such
information to help the IRS catch tax evaders.
   Mr. Checksfield, in an interview yesterday, said he hadn't
received any notice of his accounting certificate being
revoked and therefore couldn't comment. Nevertheless, the
75-year-old accountant added that he wouldn't appeal the
action. "Considering my age and the legal fees required, my
attorney has suggested I turn in my certificate."
   While serving as a certified public accountant for Steve
Noles, a St. Louis pizza restaurateur, Mr. Checksfield
provided the IRS with evidence that Mr. Noles skimmed untaxed
income from the receipts of his pizza restaurant. That led to
an indictment of Mr. Noles by a federal grand jury on six
counts of income tax evasion earlier this year. Mr. Noles
faces as much as 24 years in prison and $900,000 in fines if
convicted. His trial is scheduled for December.
   The board, in taking the action, said, "The general public
as well as the business community in general depend on the
professional advice of their CPA. To get that advice they
must be candid and open. They do so in reliance upon the
confidential relationship between them and the CPA." Mr.
Checksfield violated that relationship, the board said.
   Mr. Checksfield also was under criminal investigation by
the IRS, but the investigation has since been dropped. An
attorney for Mr. Noles had questioned whether the IRS dropped
the prosecution in exchange for Mr. Checksfield's
cooperation. The IRS has denied any such exchange.
