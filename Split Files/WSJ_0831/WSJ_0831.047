   PRINCETON, N.J. -- The number of helium atoms involved
wouldn't fill a thimble. But the stakes riding on them are
almost beyond comprehension: a solution to the world's energy
needs for the next million years or the sad end of 35 years
and $11 billion worth of scientific research.
   The helium atoms are those produced when a gas made of two
forms of hydrogen -- deuterium and tritium -- is heated to
more than 100 million degrees, causing their nuclei to fuse.
Theory says that the superhot helium atoms from the nuclear
fusions will cause more deuterium and tritium atoms to fuse,
producing more superhot helium atoms, and so on. The result:
a pollution-free fusion fire fed by an inexhaustible supply
of cheap fuel, much like the fire burning in the sun. That's
the theory. No one knows if it's true.

   While a small piece of the puzzle could be solved by
October, scientists haven't tried yet to heat
deuterium-tritium gas to more than 100 million degrees to
verify the theory as a whole. And even physicists who
devoutly believe the theory concede it could be wrong. "There
could be some undiscovered phenomenon" that would prevent the
helium atoms from igniting a fusion fire, admits Edson C.
Brolin, acting director of the Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory here.
   Thus, after more than four decades and thousands of
experiments to answer hundreds of questions, the attempt to
ignite a sunlike fusion fire on Earth is down to one
remaining scientific question: the properties of a few atoms
of helium.
   Hot fusion, as it's now being called in the wake of last
year's uproar over so-called cold fusion, is about to break
into the headlines again after a hiatus of several years.
There is a good chance that in early October scientists will
announce that for the first time they have triggered a hot
fusion reaction that produces as much energy as it consumes,
the "break-even" point that has been the first goal of fusion
research since it began in the late 1950s.
   The announcement is expected to come from either the
fusion team here at Princeton University or a similar
European team working in England, which currently enjoys a
slight lead. Perhaps it will come from both groups, which are
in the midst of launching a furious round of experiments in
the hope of hitting break-even in time to report it at a
major scientific meeting in Washington.
   "We and they both would like to say at the meeting that we
hit break-even, though whether our machines will cooperate
with us, we don't know," Mr. Brolin says.
   Researchers are hoping that hitting the break-even point
will not only mark a scientific milestone but will rejuvenate
public and congressional interest in hot fusion. For almost a
decade, the attempt to ignite a fusion fire has been
relegated to Washington's budgetary backwaters. A 1976
federal plan, drawn up in the wake of the energy crisis of
the early 1970s, envisioned spending $36 billion to get a
prototype fusion power reactor in operation by 2005. But as
the energy crisis faded, so did interest in a research effort
that couldn't pay off for at least a generation.
   So far, the rate of spending on fusion research has been
only a third of that envisioned in the plan, and the goal of
a fusion reactor has been put off until after 2020. More
importantly, claim fusion scientists, critical experiments
have been repeatedly delayed, with the result that it's still
an open scientific question whether a fusion reactor is even
feasible, much less whether one can be built in 30 years.
   Unfortunately, reaching the break-even point this fall
won't clear up that question. That's because the U.S. and
European experiments aren't fueled by deuterium-tritium gas.
They're fueled by pure deuterium, a "heavy" form of hydrogen
with a nucleus consisting of a proton and a neutron, instead
of ordinary hydrogen's simple proton. The results of the
tests are being adjusted to read as if the deuterium-tritium
gas had been used.
   Pure deuterium is fine for basic fusion experiments. If
enough superhot deuterium nuclei can be concentrated in a
small enough space for only a fraction of a second, an
appreciable amount of energy will be released. For the
break-even experiment, for example, the researchers are
trying to get 150 trillion deuterium nuclei bunched into each
cubic centimeter of space and heated to 300 million degrees
for three-tenths of a second. In this brief moment, the
experiment would use only a tenth of a gram of deuterium fuel
to produce 25 million watts of energy -- the same amount of
energy that it takes to heat the deuterium atoms to 300
million degrees.
   Pure deuterium, however, isn't the best fuel for a fusion
fire. To ignite a self-sustaining deuterium fusion fire would
require heating the deuterium gas to more than 550 million
degrees for enough fusions to occur to keep the fire burning.
   That's where the deuterium-tritium gas comes in. In
theory, according to physicist Dale Meade of the Plasma
Physics Laboratory here, it should be easier to ignite a
fusion fire with a fuel that is half deuterium and half
tritium, a triply heavy form of hydrogen with a nucleus of
two neutrons and a proton. The chances of deuterium and
tritium atoms fusing are 300 times greater than the odds of
deuterium atoms fusing, Mr. Meade explains. Thus, a
deuterium-tritium gas need be heated only to about 220
million degrees for enough fusions to occur to ignite a
self-sustaining fire, about half the energy needed to light a
pure deuterium fire.
   Until now, the researchers have avoided using tritium in
their huge fusion machines -- hollow metal doughnuts, based
on a Russian design known as a tokamak, in which the superhot
deuterium gas is trapped inside the doughnut and held away
from its walls by powerful magnetic fields. The
deuterium-tritium fusions release a shower of powerful
neutrons that can render parts of the machines radioactive
and useless for new experiments. To save the machines, which
cost hundreds of millions of dollars, fusion research has
relied solely on pure deuterium fuel.
   Now, however, the scientists say they have reached the
point where the last major scientific question about the
ignition of a fusion fire can be answered only by tests with
deuterium and tritium atoms, which produce a neutron and the
nucleus of a helium-4 atom when they fuse.
   The neutrons, being electrically neutral, slip easily
through the magnetic walls of the fusion doughnut and shoot
out of the machine with four-fifths of the energy released by
the fusion. In any future power reactor, this rain of
high-energy neutrons would slam into a surrounding "blanket,"
converting the neutrons' energy to heat that can be used for
power generation.
   The new-made helium nucleus, on the other hand, faces a
different fate. Being positively charged, it is trapped
inside the magnetic doughnut. Holding a fifth of the energy
released by the fusion, the nucleus caroms about the hot
deuterium-tritium gas like a high-speed cue ball in a pocket
billiards game. Slamming into the deuterium and tritium
atoms, the helium nuclei will trigger additional fusions. If
enough helium nuclei trigger enough fusions, the fuel quickly
will be heating itself to fusion temperatures without any
additional energy input, just as a wood fire sustains itself
once a match gets the wood heated to the right temperature.
   Scientists hope the fusion fire, once lit, would burn
continuously as long as new fuel is fed in. But even if the
fire has to be relighted every few minutes, the results would
be spectacular. Burning only about 2 1/2 pounds of
deuterium-tritium fuel would produce 1,000 megawatts of
energy, an amount that currently requires burning 9,000 tons
of coal.
   Physicists know how much energy each helium nucleus
carries, but what isn't known is whether "we will generate
enough {helium nuclei} and whether we can confine them long
enough" to keep a fusion fire burning, says Mr. Meade.
   The device to ignite the world's first controlled fusion
fire is undoubtedly the world's most expensive lighter. It is
a $360 million machine known as the Compact Ignition Tokamak.
Now on the drawing boards, the CIT will have a
doughnut-shaped fusion chamber with an outside diameter of
only seven feet, less than a third that of the 25-foot
diameter Princeton tokamak chamber. Yet, if it can ignite a
fusion fire that will burn for only five seconds, it will
produce 100 megawatts of power.
   When -- or even whether -- the CIT will be built is in the
hands of a committee advising Energy Secretary James Watkins
on how much his department should seek for fusion research in
the 1991 budget.
   If the CIT successfully ignites a fusion fire, the next
step will be an engineering test reactor to be built jointly
by the U.S., the Soviet Union, Japan and the European
Community. If, on the other hand, the helium nuclei don't
behave as physicists predict, the 35-year quest for the
fusion fire may be over.
