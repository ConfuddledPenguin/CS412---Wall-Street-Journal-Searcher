   From a July 13 bulletin by the AFL-CIO's American
Institute for Free Labor Development:

   Militant eagerness to strike is a notably new posture for
Sandinista labor officials. In 1984, the ATC's Garcia
{Sandinista Association of Rural Workers chief Edgardo
Garcia} defended the Sandinista government's decision to
outlaw strikes on the grounds that "to strike would be to
deliver ourselves to the counter-revolution and U.S.
aggression. . . . Instead of strikes, we have decided that
mutual dialogue is the way to resolve disputes." In 1985,
Jimenez {Lucio Jimenez, chief of the Sandinista Workers
Central, or CST} explained the CST position this way: "We do
not want strikes. What we want is, for example, orders for
machetes not to fall behind. Why not? Because if we do not
have machetes we cannot carry out the sugar harvest." . . .
   Since their inception, the Sandinista labor organizations
assumed what the leftwing Guardian newspaper called "the role
of allies of management in increasing output." In January
1987, for example, Jimenez criticized sugar workers who "did
not respond with all their capacity to the demands of the
revolution for an increase in their productive output." In
its May Day slogans of 1988, the CST exhorted its members to
"fight inflation with more production, not strikes," and
"fight against inefficiency in the workplace." . . .
   Are the Sandinista unions now converting themselves into
organizations that represent the interests of workers? To the
members of independent unions like CUS {Confederation of
Trade Union Unity}, the answer is a resounding "no." "The
underlying issue is power, pure and simple," stated Jose
Espinoza of CUS. "The Sandinista unions are still arms of the
Sandinista front, regardless of what demands they put
forward," he said. "Their willingness to drag this country
down to achieve their `government from below' has further
alienated the workers."
