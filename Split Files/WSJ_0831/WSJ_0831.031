   WASHINGTON -- The Transportation Department selected
United Parcel Service Co. to serve a new all-cargo air route
to Japan.
   UPS plans to operate six flights a week using Boeing 747
aircraft between Louisville, Ky.; Anchorage, Alaska; and
Tokyo, according to the department.

   Emery Worldwide Airlines, a unit of Consolidated
Freightways Inc., was the only other carrier that applied for
the route authority. It was awarded backup authority. The
department found that UPS's proposed service would deliver
more capacity than Emery's and faster service to shippers in
the market.
   The cargo route was authorized in the November 1989
agreement between Japan and the U.S. that called for a
substantial expansion of air service between the countries.
