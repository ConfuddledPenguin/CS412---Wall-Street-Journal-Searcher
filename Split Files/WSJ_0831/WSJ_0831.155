   NEW YORK -- The renewed upward climb in oil prices stomped
on long-term Treasury bonds again, but rumors that the
Federal Reserve will soon reduce interest rates boosted
short-term notes.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended more than 1/2 point
lower, a loss of more than $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, rose to 8.97%.

   Traders said that prices of long-term Treasury bonds
posted the bulk of their declines during overnight trading in
Japan and Europe, falling as the price of crude climbed. When
U.S. trading began, bond prices slipped a little further.
   The October contract for crude oil futures ended at $26.77
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 85 cents
from Wednesday. November crude oil rose 72 cents to finish at
$26.54 a barrel.
   Meanwhile, prices of two-year Treasury notes ended
slightly higher, as some investors sold bonds and rushed to
buy short-term securities after hearing rumors that the Fed
will lower the federal funds rate -- the rate on overnight
loans between banks -- from 8% to about 7.75%.
   "The rumors continued to fly that the Fed will have to
ease in the next few days," said Sung Won Sohn, economist at
Norwest Corp., a bank holding company in Minneapolis. Such a
move would benefit short-term bills and notes, but isn't
expected to have much impact on long-term bonds.
   But overnight and across the Pacific, the Bank of Japan
moved in the other direction, tightening policy by raising
the official discount rate to 6% from 5.25%.
   Although long-term bond yields rose yesterday, some
analysts were surprised that yields didn't rise even further
considering the Bank of Japan discount rate hike. In fact,
analysts said many investors focused mainly on oil prices and
paid little attention to rising Japanese rates.
   Typically, when interest rates in one country rise, the
value of the U.S. dollar depreciates, which in turn, pulls
down the value of dollar-denominated, fixed-income
securities. But the value of the dollar gained strength
yesterday, and may have lent some support to U.S. bonds.
   "Some of the trading was a bit strange in the global bond
market," said William Sullivan, director of money-market
research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "I would have thought
that higher {Japanese} interest rates would weaken the dollar
and weaken the Japanese financial markets. Instead, the
dollar firmed and Japanese bonds firmed and that is
puzzling."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
97 20/32, down from 98 5/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield
rose to 8.97% from 8.92%.
   The latest two-year notes ended higher at 100 1/32 to
yield 8.09%. The price was up from 99 31/32 to yield 8.13% on
Wednesday.
   Rates on Treasury bills fell. The discount rate on
three-month bills ended at 7.44% for a bond-equivalent yield
of 7.67%, while the rate on six-month bills ended at 7.39%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.77%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate &amp; Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds limped lower as slumping stock prices put
pressure on the speculative-grade, high-yield market.
   But activity was very light as most investors prepared for
the long Labor Day holiday weekend. Most junk bonds ended
unchanged to 1/4 point lower as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell 39.11 points to 2,593.32.
   "It was a very dull day with prices drifting lower and
people waiting for the vacation," said one junk-bond trader,
expressing a view that was shared by many.
   Among the big losers yesterday: RJR Nabisco Inc.'s 17.375%
convertible pay-in-kind debentures which finished down 5/8
point at 108 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pay-in-kind
bonds pay interest in the form of additional securities.
   Meanwhile, Hospital Corp. of America's 17.5% preferred
stock rose on the expectation that the company will call its
high-yielding preferred issue now that most of an outstanding
bridge loan has been paid. Hospital Corp.'s preferred stock
climbed 1 3/8 point to 21 5/8 while the company's zero-coupon
junk bonds finished one point higher at 77 1/2.
   Among investment-grade corporate bonds, high-grade issues
ended 3/8 point lower.

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Municipal securities ended flat to 1/4 point lower.
   Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were 1/8 point lower at
98 1/8.
   "We're hanging in there," one municipal trader said of the
market. "There's not the sort of tension that was around last
Friday that `there's going to be a fighting war this weekend
and I don't want to own anything,'" he noted.
   At the short end, municipal note prices are steady.
   Volatility at the long end of the market has paid off for
notes, traders said. New issues that came to market see good
demand and are quickly scooped up by investors. In addition,
little selling has been seen in the market.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities prices ended with slim declines.
   Government National Mortgage Association, Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association
9.5% pass-through securities for September delivery were all
off 2/32, at 98 14/ 32, 98 1/32 and 98 18/32, respectively.
   In the Treasury market, 10-year notes have dropped 9/32 to
99 9/32.
   In the primary market, two more real estate investment
conduit securities offerings were announced this session for
a total of $500 million.
   Remic volume in August is approaching $18 billion, making
it the largest monthly issuance on record.
   The latest entries are two non-agency deals.
   UBS Securities Inc. priced $200 million of Residential
Funding Corp. Remics. The offering, backed by 30-year whole
loans, is all sold, the underwriter says.
   Whole loans are ordinary home mortgage loans that can't be
sold to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae because their size or other
features don't meet agency guidelines.
   Also, a $300 million issue of Collateralized Mortgage
Securities Corp. Remics was offered by First Boston Corp. The
issue, through a special trust called CMSC 1990-5, is backed
by Ginnie Mae 9.5% securities.
   In the secondary mortgage market, traders say the
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal thrift bailout agency,
unloaded at least $700 million of securities in at least
three bid lists this week that were well received.
   Reportedly, the RTC offered $400 million of whole loans on
Monday, $200 million of whole loans on Tuesday and $100
million of various issues such as 30-year and 15-year
mortgage securities.
   There was strong investor appetite for the whole loans, a
trader said. And the 15-year securities were said to have
benefited from a steepening yield curve. Shorter-duration
issues find favor in a steepening curve environment than
long-duration issues, because investors seek the safety and
liquidity of that short-term sector.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government bond market ended firmer
yesterday, even though the nation's central bank pushed
interest rates higher.
   The Bank of Japan said it raised the official discount
rate by 3/4 percentage point to 6% in an effort to prevent a
resurgence of inflation, calm Japan's jittery financial
markets and to provide conditions that would allow for
continued economic growth.
   An increase in the discount rate, which the central bank
charges on loans to financial institutions, had been the
subject of widespread speculation for weeks. But while
investors and dealers were expecting the increase, it came
earlier than many had anticipated.
   In trading, Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond ended
Tokyo Stock Exchange dealings at a price of 83.06, up 0.88
point, to yield 8.115%. (When calculated using the semiannual
compound method used for U.S. bonds, the yield on the No. 119
ended at 7.47%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   Although bond prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks
on expectations that interest rates were heading higher,
traders said that some speculators rushed to buy bonds after
the rate hike in a classic "sell the rumor, buy the fact"
scenario.
   European bond markets were mixed yesterday in subdued
trading. West German bonds ended modestly lower while British
government bonds ended modestly higher.
