   Portland General Electric Co.. Portland, Ore., said the
Oregon Public Utility Commission's staff recommended
increasing its 1991 revenue by $917,000, a fraction of the
$81 million the company requested in the latest round of
rate-increase negotiations.
   In March, the utility filed a request for an $89 million
increase in revenue. The utility commission came back last
month with a recommendation that the Portland General Corp.
unit be allowed a $6 million increase.

   Portland General Electric said it will have an opportunity
to rebut the commission's most recent recommendation and to
hold settlement discussions with it before public hearings on
the rate request open Nov. 26.
