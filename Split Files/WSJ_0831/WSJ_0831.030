   WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision said the
number of savings and loans it rates as healthiest dropped 7%
at the end of the first quarter from the end of 1989.
   The number of so-called Group 1 institutions, which the
OTS describes as "well capitalized and profitable" dropped to
1,175 at the end of March from 1,264 at the end of December,
the agency said. Those thrifts held assets of $363 billion,
or 35% of the industry total, at March 31.

   "Given the slowdown in the economy and the real estate
market in many sections of the country, we are not surprised
by the slippage in the healthiest group," said OTS Director
Timothy Ryan. "If current economic conditions continue or get
worse, it's very possible we will see additional
deterioration."
   For purposes of analysis, the OTS this year began breaking
down the industry into four categories. In the first quarter,
232 thrifts moved down in ranking or were placed under
government control, while only 73 moved up. However, Mr. Ryan
maintained that it was too early to detect any strong trends
in the overall health of the industry. "I would wait until
the end of the year or early next year to figure out what
trends we have here," he said. He also declined to comment on
the potential effect of the deterioration on the cost of the
S&amp;L industry bailout.
   The downturn wasn't a big surprise; last month, the OTS
reported that the thrift industry had an overall loss of $271
million in the first quarter.
   At the end of the first quarter, there were 680
institutions, holding $351 billion in assets in Group 2,
which the OTS defines as meeting or expected to meet capital
requirements. In Group 3 thrifts, which the agency describes
as "troubled with poor earnings and low capital," there were
352 thrifts with $169 billion in assets. There were 246
thrifts with $166 billion in assets in Group 4, which OTS
says are thrifts expected to be taken over by the government
and sold off or closed.
   The data don't include S&amp;Ls already taken over and being
run by the government.
