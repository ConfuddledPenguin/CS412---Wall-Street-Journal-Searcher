   HALT's legal activists seem to be finally getting some
respect -- along with the usual volley of brickbats.
   The advocacy group, whose acronym stands for Help Abolish
Legal Tyranny, is waging a sophisticated state-by-state
campaign to chip away at lawyers' monopoly on the legal
system. Its activists lobby bar organizations and state
legislatures to persuade them to open lawyer disciplinary
proceedings to the public and the practice of law to trained
non-lawyers.

   In California, legislators plan to look at a HALT-drafted
bill on legal affordability. An American Bar Association
panel is taking some of its complaints about lawyer
discipline seriously.
   But HALT's lobbying in Texas has angered leading lawyers
there, and in Florida tensions have been high since the
state's HALT director was charged with fraud.
   The national group claims 150,000 dues-paying members and
annual revenue of about $40,000 from sales of its legal
self-help books. Last year, the nonprofit organization had a
budget of $2.5 million. It also grades state legal systems.
And it lobbies; it lobbies a lot.
   HALT didn't start the legal reform movement that began in
the late 1960s with the proliferation of legal aid clinics,
self-help books and a rush to small-claims courts. The idea
of a legal consumer-rights watchdog organization was hatched
at a Washington cocktail party in 1978 by two Rhodes
scholars, who then founded HALT.
   At first, the legal establishment dismissed HALT as the
lunatic fringe.
   "I was predisposed to think of them as, kind of, like the
Yippies of the legal profession," says Stephen Gillers, a
professor at New York University School of Law.
   But Mr. Gillers says he has changed his opinion about
HALT. "When they show up at meetings, the HALT people know
what they're talking about."
   The group has turned into the Nader's Raiders of legal
reform, sophisticated lobbyists who have the ear of state and
national bar associations. Nowadays, HALT officials try to
downplay the original rallying cry of abolishing legal
tyranny.
   "A lot of people had a lot of trouble getting past our
name," says Deborah Chalfie, HALT legislative director.
   HALT argues that the legal system serves the average
middle-class consumer poorly. This would be the world
according to HALT:
   -- Like auto mechanics and other service providers,
lawyers would be required to give their prospective clients
written estimates.
   -- If lawyers overcharged or performed incompetently,
clients would be entitled to a refund. Lawyers could be fined
if they failed to return their clients' phone calls.
   -- Clients would pay bargain-basement prices for basic
legal services because non-lawyers would be permitted to
handle out-of-court legal matters.
   Of course the legal establishment is far from accepting
HALT's utopian view. So in the meantime, HALT carefully picks
its battles.
   In California, HALT has found an ally in Democratic State
Sen. Robert Presley. He will preside this fall over a
committee that will examine the HALT-drafted Affordable Legal
Services Bill.
   It would allow legal technicians (non-lawyers like
paralegals) to provide out-of-court legal services for 14
non-criminal matters, such as uncontested divorces, simple
bankruptcies, name changes, housing and estate planning that
often require nothing more than filing the correct documents.
The technicians would be required to use written contracts,
give estimates of fees and inform clients that they aren't
lawyers.
   Longtime HALT detractor P. Terry Anderlini, former
California state bar president, says that if the legal
technicians "constrain themselves to small legal matters,
then I think there is a need for them." But he adds, "I'm
concerned that they will pass out a lot of bad advice and
turn into a referral service for some lawyers."
   HALT critics have Texan accents, too, where the local bar,
which acts as a professional and regulatory body, is having
its once-every-12-years review by a state panel.
   HALT activists have fought to have Texas open its
disciplinary proceedings to the public. They want non-lawyers
included on the board that hears disciplinary cases and
publication of the names of attorneys facing disciplinary
charges. (Texas publishes only the names of attorneys who are
actually disciplined.) HALT wants the Texas Legislature,
rather than the courts, to have the ultimate authority to
regulate lawyers.
   That would put lawyers under the thumb of a fickle,
politics-driven body, complains Texas Bar President James
Parsons. As for HALT's support of more use of non-lawyers,
Mr. Parsons says: "They think just about everybody should be
able to practice law. I guess they think everybody should be
able to slice open a belly and remove an appendix."
   The heat is even higher in Florida. HALT's relationship
with the state legal establishment deteriorated early this
year when Daniel E. Schramek, the director of HALT's Florida
chapter, was arrested and charged with using fraud and
forgery to prepare divorce documents.
   Mr. Schramek, who isn't a lawyer, runs a clinic in St.
Petersburg that helps people file legal forms. The state
attorney says that Mr. Schramek twice forged a customer's
signature, notarized it and submitted it to a court. If
convicted, he faces five years in prison. The Florida bar is
also investigating Mr. Schramek for allegedly practicing law
without a license.
   Mr. Schramek says he suspects that the state prosecutors
and the Florida bar have conspired to falsely prosecute him
because he has criticized the bar as secretive and
self-serving. "This is laughable, nothing more than a
malicious prosecution," Mr. Schramek says.
   A spokesman for the state attorney's office in St.
Petersburg says Mr. Schramek's "prosecution has nothing to do
with any group he's a member of or an advocacy on his part."
   HALT criticizes lawyers in plenty of other states, too. It
recently graded how responsive each state's legal system is
to the public. California and the state of Washington each
received a "C," the highest grade. Mississippi, Nebraska,
Wyoming, Alabama and Pennsylvania scored too low to rate a
letter grade.
   Nationally, the Washington, D.C., group wants the American
Bar Association to change its model rules for disciplining
attorneys. HALT says current rules don't respond enough to
harm done to clients, don't really help with fee disputes or
complaints of lawyer incivility.
