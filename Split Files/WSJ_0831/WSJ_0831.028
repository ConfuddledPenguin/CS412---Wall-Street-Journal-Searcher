   ST. LOUIS -- Comprehensive Care Corp. said its newly

   Comprehensive Care, a provider of chemical dependency
programs, said its former president, W. James Nicol, who was
removed as chief executive officer, will continue to serve as
a board member. Norman L. Perry, president of Tree Products
Enterprises, was named chairman of the company, succeeding
Stanley Nelson, who was also removed from the post.
   The new board was elected Aug. 20 after a prolonged fight
between the former management and a dissident group of
stockholders. All of the directors, except Mr. Nicol, are new
to the board. There are now eight board members.
   Comprehensive Care said the board also named Donald G.
Simpson, a former officer of the company, to the new post of
executive vice president and chief operating officer.
