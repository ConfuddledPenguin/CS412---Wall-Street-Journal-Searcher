   Henry Birks &amp; Sons Ltd., Montreal, said it is holding
talks on selling 40 jewelry stores in the U.S. to James C.
and Daniel P. Gordon, veterans of the business.
   William Meder, chief operating officer, said closely held
Birks set a Sept. 30 deadline to conclude a transaction with
the Gordon brothers, who approached Birks. The brothers are
part of the family group that controlled Houston-based Gordon
Jewelry Corp., which Zale Corp. acquired last year for about
$312 million. James Gordon said he and his brother "want to
get back in the jewelry business.

   Mr. Meder said the discussions are still at an early
stage. He said the 40 stores up for sale operate under a
variety of names in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and San
Diego. Birks's 14 remaining U.S. stores, in San Francisco and
Boston, aren't on the block. Birks owns 220 stores in Canada
and the U.S. Mr. Meder said Birks had 1989 sales of 387
million Canadian dollars (US$339 million).
