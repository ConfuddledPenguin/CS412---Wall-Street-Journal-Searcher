   LOS ANGELES -- A. Bruce Rozet lives in the opulent
Brentwood section of this city, a self-made man steeped in
the comfort of his success. His mansion stretches to 14,000
square feet and boasts terraced tropical gardens and a
remote-controlled back yard waterfall.
   It is a far cry from Tyler House, a low-income housing
project in Washington, D.C., where rats and mice scurry
through the halls, the elevators don't work and drug dealers
have been known to do business in the open. But, until
recently, Mr. Rozet, through his Associated Financial Corp.,
controlled these homes too.

   Tyler House is just a tiny part of a virtual empire of
low-income housing that helped make Mr. Rozet a rich man,
thanks in part to Department of Housing and Urban Development
money that helped finance the projects. At last count,
Associated Financial controlled, through nearly 170 operating
partnerships and affiliates, more than 350 different
low-income housing projects with about 45,000 residential
units in some 40 states. Mr. Rozet became such a success that
Congress began asking his advice on how best to build
federally subsidized apartments.
   Not any more. These days, senior HUD officials openly
condemn the 60-year-old Mr. Rozet. The agency has accused
Associated Financial of misappropriating funds from several
projects, and Congress has asked for an accounting of where
his investors' money has gone. HUD has also taken possession
of Tyler House, castigating Mr. Rozet for the project's
condition; in January, it suspended the developer from doing
any new business with HUD for at least a year. A HUD board of
appeals completed an administrative hearing on Mr. Rozet's
case in June and is expected to decide soon whether to
continue the suspension.
   For his part, Mr. Rozet insists he is getting a bum rap. A
former think-tank scholar, Mr. Rozet says his choice of
occupation is driven as much by compassion as the profit
motive. "I help people because it's in my nature," he
maintains. He says HUD has singled him out because the
agency, beset by its own problems, wants a whipping boy. He
contends that politics and "dirty tricks" are at work: He is
a Democrat, he notes, and the administration is Republican.
   HUD's action against him is a stiff sanction. The agency
has alleged that Associated Financial mishandled about
$40,000, a small amount considering that the company controls
one of the largest portfolios of low-income housing in the
country. "There's been a very hysterical reaction to Bruce
Rozet," argues one former senior HUD official who has worked
closely with him. "I'm suspicious that they're using him as a
symbol, that there's a political side to this."
   Whatever the case, the Rozet deliberations have come to
represent something more than just one man running afoul of
the government. They reflect the efforts of scandal-plagued
HUD to recast itself -- albeit belatedly -- as a new,
by-the-book agency. And they also reveal how a policy meant
to encourage private investors to help fund low-income
projects can go seriously awry.
   This, notably, isn't Mr. Rozet's first run-in with
regulators. He has been involved in two major securities
scandals and has had business ties to people who later landed
in jail. "Obviously, that looks bad for me now," he says,
maintaining that he hasn't done anything illegal.
   Instead, he suggests he has simply mastered the intricate
rules and regulations that govern the low-income housing
industry. And much to his benefit: In an Associated Financial
filing with California regulators in 1987, his net worth was
listed as $10.5 million, excluding his 33% stake in his
company.
   Basically, Mr. Rozet's business works like this:
Associated Financial identifies a distressed apartment
building in which HUD has backed the mortgage and helps to
pay at least some of the residents' rent. The company offers
to take control of the property and fix it up. Typically, the
money to do that comes from a combination of new HUD loans
and private capital Associated Financial raises from
investors.
   The investors don't expect a cash return; instead, they
receive valuable federal tax credits through a program that,
for years, has encouraged private investment in low-income
housing. In the process, Associated Financial receives
millions in management and other fees. "This is what I do,
and it's not the kind of thing where you become Mr.
Popularity," Mr. Rozet says.
   One example of Mr. Rozet's projects is the Glenarden
Apartments, a 15-minute drive from downtown Washington. In
late 1988, HUD agreed to lend partnerships connected to
Associated Financial $16.5 million to rehabilitate the
property. That, in turn, enabled Associated Financial to
offer new tax credits, and, as a result, it was able to raise
an additional $7.6 million from private investors. Of that
sum, HUD records show, some $4 million went to pay debt and
$1.8 million went toward the restoration. Nearly $1.5 million
went straight into Associated Financial's coffers.
   "They don't have to put up anything," grouses one top HUD
official. "All they have to do is sell the credits."
   But Mr. Rozet counters that lawmakers obviously favor such
arrangements, given that they recently extended the use of
low-income housing tax credits. Associated Financial spent
about $1 million of its own putting together the plan to
improve Glenarden, Mr. Rozet insists. And in late February,
he told a House Banking subcommittee that the turnaround at
the 26-acre site is "quickly becoming the most successful
housing revitalization undertaking in the country."
   Yet there's one part of the story Mr. Rozet leaves out: It
was his management company that watched Glenarden deteriorate
in the first place. Associated Financial began to lobby HUD
to come up with the loan only after officials in Prince
Georges County, Md., threatened to prevent the company from
collecting any more rent. "They've done a good job" making
Glenarden a better place to live, says Lynda Given, director
of the county's Department of Housing and Coummunity
Development. "But they've done a good job because we were
threatening their livelihood."
   Indeed, his critics argue that Mr. Rozet's long business
history doesn't inspire sympathy. A Philadelphia native, he
earned an engineering degree from Penn State but was always
more intrigued by balance sheets than blueprints. He joined a
small Los Angeles oil firm in 1964 as a financial officer.
When it was swallowed the next year by Commonwealth United
Corp. of Beverly Hills, he emerged as chief executive.
   With the aid of his friend and investment banker, Burt
Kleiner, he bought up one small company after another. Soon,
Commonwealth United had stretched too far. Bank financing
dried up and creditors were due $100 million. In October 1969
-- with six years still to run on his guaranteed
$120,000-a-year contract -- Mr. Rozet resigned.
   That same day, the SEC sued the company, charging that its
filings in five takeover transactions were "false and
misleading." Documents from the case also said Commonwealth
United "failed to disclose fully and accurately" its ties to
Mr. Kleiner's firm, Kleiner, Bell &amp; Co.
   Commonwealth United, without admitting guilt, consented to
a court order enjoining it from future violations. Kleiner
Bell and its founder were forced out of the securities
industry in December 1970 for, among other things, selling
Commonwealth United stock on inside information. Mr. Rozet
stresses that he wasn't named personally in any of the SEC's
actions.
   Not long after, Mr. Rozet made a career switch. He says he
became acquainted with local tenant advocates through his
first wife, who ran day-care programs in the oceanside
neighborhood of Venice, Calif., in the late 1960s. From the
start, he understood what many could not: How private
enterprise could benefit handsomely from low-income housing
programs. With the government promising to accelerate the
depreciation on these properties, Mr. Rozet recognized that
not only could the housing shelter the poor, it also could
shelter the rich -- from taxes.
   Mr. Rozet's first venture in the business was Income
Equities Corp. But in 1977, Income Equities, Mr. Rozet and
three associates were accused by the SEC in a civil case of
making a series of misleading statements to investors. For
instance, the firm sold $45 million in limited partnerships
without properly disclosing their past performance, the SEC
alleged. In addition, the commission said Mr. Rozet and the
others moved money around from one partnership to the next,
creating "the illusion" that a certain cash flow had been
achieved and that they therefore were entitled to management
fees.
   Mr. Rozet, without admitting guilt, agreed in a settlement
to restrict for three years his involvement with real-estate
securities, limiting his role to that of a consultant. Mr.
Rozet blames his troubles back then on government guidelines.
"We got caught up in some things that were not well defined,"
he contends today.
   Mr. Rozet's current company has its roots in a firm called
National Development Services Corp. that he started in the
1970s to advise others how to best structure low-income
housing ventures. By 1980, the business formed the foundation
of what would become Associated Financial.
   During the 1980s, HUD, under the stewardship of Secretary
Samuel Pierce, became a place where major Republican figures,
some of them former government officials, received favored
treatment, snaring lucrative subsidies and grants for
projects in which they often held a financial interest. "When
we went to HUD, we were asked, `What party are you guys
from?'" Mr. Rozet says. "Nobody opened any doors for us. We
sat in the lobby while the Republicans got in."
   But records obtained by this newspaper under the Freedom
of Information Act reveal that, at least for a time, Mr.
Rozet had his own conduit to HUD decision makers. Mr. Rozet
used a brash Oklahoma middleman, Charles Bazarian, who would
march into HUD's multifamily-housing division without an
appointment and sometimes even demand that secretaries there
type his letters, according to an internal HUD inspector
general report.
   "Bazarian was always around, dropping names" of top HUD
political appointees he said he could influence, says Richard
Vogel, who recently retired as a HUD loan specialist.
   Mr. Bazarian is now serving a two-year prison sentence on
bank-fraud charges unrelated to HUD, and declined to be
interviewed. Once that sentence ends, he'll begin a five-year
term for failing to file an income-tax return and for
defrauding auditors at two California thrifts. On top of
that, he has been given three years' probation for skimming
money at HUD projects in Oklahoma, one of them in Associated
Financial's portfolio.
   Mr. Rozet plays down his ties to Mr. Bazarian. "We didn't
check his past because HUD introduced us," Mr. Rozet says.
"He was never an employee of the company. He was really a
property finder and received a fee based on what a deal was
worth."
   By late 1987, midlevel HUD officials had recommended that
Mr. Rozet be barred from purchasing any more federally
subsidized apartments because they thought his properties
were such a mess. However, the decision was reversed by
Thomas Demery, who was formerly one of Mr. Pierce's assistant
secretaries for housing and is now a business consultant.
"The fact is, a lot of people have strong emotions about
Bruce Rozet," Mr. Demery said in an interview earlier this
year. "A lot of that is because he knows HUD's regulations
better than HUD. It tends to rankle the bureaucrats." He
added that his staff never could supply evidence to warrant
barring Mr. Rozet.
   Nonetheless, when Jack Kemp, the new housing secretary,
toured the blighted Tyler House project in June 1989, he
vowed to hold Associated Financial accountable. Not long
after, the company was suspended from doing business with
HUD.
   The agency has charged that an Associated Financial
subsidiary embezzled security deposits, submitted false
information and engaged in other "irregularities of a serious
nature" at Tyler House and several other apartment buildings
in the District of Columbia, Louisiana and Oklahoma. Mr.
Rozet later told the House subcommittee that at least 85% of
Associated Financial's vast holdings meet standards, but HUD
general counsel Frank Keating disputes that assessment in an
interview.
   He maintains that a fourth of the properties "are in a
deplorable state." The violations found so far "are merely a
snapshot, symptomatic of a larger problem," he says. As for
Mr. Rozet's claims that he is simply a scapegoat for a
vindictive Republican administration, Mr. Keating says: "The
best friends Rozet had in Washington were in the Republican
administration of Samuel Pierce," the former HUD secretary.
"Those people looked the other way. There is no excuse for
Rozet's projects to have disintegrated the way they did. This
isn't a partisan issue, it's a health and safety issue."
   Mr. Rozet says he has provided HUD with canceled checks
and other documents proving Associated Financial hasn't
fleeced anyone. In the meantime, he has decided to get out of
the low-income housing business and sell his company. "I
can't work with HUD anymore," he says. "It's probably better
under the circumstances to have somebody else take over our
properties."
   Should Associated Financial be purchased, HUD is sure to
pressure the new owner to clean things up fast. But Mr. Rozet
contends that, unless the government puts up more money, no
private enterprise will be able to turn around the most
decrepit housing in his company's portfolio.
   "This is supposed to be a partnership," Mr. Rozet says.
"For HUD to blame us is only because we mirror their
failure."
