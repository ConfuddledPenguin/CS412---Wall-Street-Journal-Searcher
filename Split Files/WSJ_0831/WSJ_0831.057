   Harley.
   For decades, that name triggered images of burly bad boys
roaring down the highway on big black bikes.

   It was a mystique molded by popular culture and encouraged
by the manufacturer, Harley-Davidson Inc. So what if
leather-clad Marlon Brando didn't really ride a Harley in
"The Wild One," the 1954 movie about a motorcycle-gang
leader? People thought he did, and they hankered to hitch
along.
   Somewhere, though, the harum-scarum aura of tattooed
Hell's Angels and Easy Rider-era hippies became as much a
liability for Harley-Davidson as an asset. By the early
1980s, hurt by leaky, unreliable bikes and plunging market
share, the lone American motorcycle maker was brushing up
against bankruptcy. And with baby boomers headed for their
own midlife crises, the company appeared on the verge of
missing a huge new market.
   But it didn't.
   Less than a decade later, Harley-Davidson is enticing
white-collar workers to become weekend warriors. One in three
of today's Harley buyers is a professional or manager. About
60% have attended college, up from only 45% in 1984. Their
median age is 35, and their median household income has risen
sharply to $45,000 from $36,000 five years earlier.
   All this makes Milwaukee-based Harley the industry's
hottest company. Despite price tags that top $15,000 for
dressed-up touring bikes, its market share has climbed for
six years in a row. While Japanese competitors were chasing
each other with motorcycles of all sizes, Harley has captured
about 60% of the market for biggest bikes -- up from 23% in
1983. "Harley capitalizes on the impression they have the
`real motorcycle,'" says Bruce Johnson of J.D. Power &amp;
Associates, a California market-research firm.
   Harley-Davidson's turnaround suggests how a company, as
times change, can position a product without dissipating its
mystique. That isn't easy. The marketplace is filled with
brands, such as Coors, Volkswagen and Zenith, that once
carried, but then lost, a certain cachet. Some let
competitors erode their market; others failed to realize that
demographic changes demand new marketing approaches.
Successful marketers, says Michael Marsden, professor of
popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio,
"realize their long history and play off it."
   What Harley officials managed to do was broaden their
bikes' appeal while keeping them looking big, mean and
American. They improved engine reliability and smoothed the
fit and finish -- though even as Harley overtook Honda in the
big-bike market, consumer surveys continued to suggest that
American Honda Motor Co. makes a better motorcycle.
   Officials targeted the yuppie generation by smoothing
Harley's rougher edges. They told dealers to brighten up
their stores with more lights. They slapped the Harley name
on cologne and wine coolers. They even competed with biker
clubs such as Hell's Angels with their own Harley Owners
Group.
   "We tried to leave nothing to chance," says Vaughn L.
Beals Jr., Harley's chairman, who headed a 1981
management-led leveraged buy-out from AMF Inc. Five years
later, Harley went public.
   The company's restyled mystique captured Todd Van Slyke,
for one. The 42-year-old Chicago advertising executive rides
his Harley on weekends with a group called the Rolex Rangers.
When you ride a Harley, he says, you're doing something "a
little bit nasty."
   Another devotee is Mike McAlister of Flagstaff, Ariz. On
weekdays, the middle-aged federal government administrator
wears a jacket and tie and drives a Honda Accord. Weekends,
he dons leather vest, earring and gold neck chain and jumps
on his Harley. "This is the real me]" he declares.
   Robert Lefton, a St. Louis psychologist, thinks that some
Harley buyers are grappling with midlife turmoil, and may see
a Harley as a chance to feel free, powerful and, well,
virile. "Here you are at middle age, and suddenly you feel
young," he says.
   Harley's image as a rugged bike goes back decades. In
1903, William Harley and the Davidson brothers -- William,
Walter and Arthur -- built three motorcycles in the
Davidsons' Milwaukee back yard. The bikes were crude but
tough; one of the first went 100,000 miles.
   They were also all-American. Harleys served as police
bikes beginning in 1907 and as scout and dispatch vehicles in
both world wars. In 1953, when Indian Motocycle Manufacturing
Co. of Springfield, Mass., stopped making its Indian
motorcycle, Harley was left as the last of what once were
more than 150 U.S. producers.
   Harley prospered until its troubles in the late 1970s and
early 1980s forced drastic changes. It successfully lobbied
the Reagan administration for stiff import tariffs against
Japanese bikes from 1983 to 1987 and then struggled to catch
up.
   Practically every step Harley took was geared to
attracting upscale riders. The first was to improve quality.
Officials realized that although blue-collar buyers, loyal
and mechanically inclined, might put up with a bike needing
frequent attention, the new generation of Harley riders
wouldn't. In 1983 it introduced the so-called evolution
engine, an improvement on the then-familiar V-twin.
Reliability increased, and owners no longer had to get their
hands dirty repeatedly fixing their machines.
   Harley also reduced vibration on its top-of-the-line
touring bikes by mounting the engines on rubber, and it
offered options such as sophisticated stereo systems and
intercoms built into helmets. But the company didn't tinker
with a few things: Its bikes still come with lots of chrome
and iron and a heavy dose of tail-pipe thunder. "It makes
your heart thump a bit," says Larry Winse, an Arizona dentist
who bought his first Harley in 1985.
   Many changes, though, involved marketing, not
manufacturing. Harley officials began wearing red or white
shirts at motorcycle rallies to dispel the image that Harley
riders wore only black. They revised their ads to lob gentle
messages at yuppies. A 1988 ad by Carmichael-Lynch, Harley's
Minneapolis agency, summed up the appeal with the slogan:
"Life should be so simple." The ad showed a stark 1950s
kitchen with refrigerator, table, chair -- and a Harley on
the white floor.
   Dealers cleaned up their stores, many of which had
conveyed a dark, menacing atmosphere. "Some people told us
they were afraid to walk into a dealership," says Jerry
Wilke, Harley's vice president of sales and marketing. The
newest "designer store" dealerships would make a Hell's Angel
weep: They sell motorcycle-fashion clothing amid neon lights,
mirrored dressing rooms and revolving jewelry cases next to
the 20-W-50 motor oil. Dealers are even advised how to
"present a look on a mannequin," says Clyde Fessler, vice
president of merchandising.
   Harley also worked on its image through licensing
agreements, with Mr. Fessler striving to convince retailers
that the bike's black, white and orange logo would attract
business, not scare it off. He showed them demographic data
and pictures of celebrities like Kurt Russell and Elizabeth
Taylor on Harleys. The company tries to let its name appear
only on quality items. In clothing, it monitors cotton
content and thread counts. And last year's promotional
activities even included Harley-Davidson fashion night at
Bloomingdale's.
   "As the demographic profile of the baby-boom shifts," Mr.
Fessler says, "so does our program."
   Because motorcycles often are an impulse purchase, one of
Harley's biggest challenges is holding its new customers
after they have bought a bike. Enter the Harley Owners Group,
or HOG. Run through local dealers, HOG gives the new rider
instant companionship through organized rides, rallies and
charity runs.
   HOG rallies are popular with Harley's new converts, many
of whom shun the tough biker rallies with Harley women who
bare their breasts or Harley men who destroy Hondas for fun.
Among those at a HOG rally in Phoenix last spring was Jerry
Clark, an IBM engineer who owns six Harleys but sports a
"ride straight" pin on his leather vest, and Jean McGrath, a
plant dealer who reads books while riding on the back of her
husband's touring bike.
   The rallies also give Harley executives a chance to see
what's on customers' minds. Richard F. Teerlink, chief
executive, rode into Phoenix on a new Ultra Glide with his
wife, Ann, on back. Then he held a "town hall" session that
attracted both easy riders in black boots and weekend rebels
in loafers.
   One biker asked whether Harley would wimp out and put
rubber mounting under the engine of its Softail model.
(Probably not.) Another griped that his Fat Boy bike was a
lemon and wanted to know what the company planned to do about
it. (A marketing man suggested they talk later.) Some
questions reflected quite different concerns. A gentleman in
the back asked whether Harley-Davidson planned to pay
dividends on its stock, which is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. (No.) Another wondered how the company's
acquisition of a recreational-vehicle maker is working out.
(So-so.)
   So far, Harley has been able to satisfy its new customers
without alienating the old. Despite a shrinking domestic
market (last year's industry sales of 217,000 road bikes were
down two-thirds from their 1980 peak), the company sold
41,000 motorcycles in the U.S. last year, up from 27,000 in
1983. Harley plays only in the super-heavyweight category and
lets the Japanese fight over the shrinking market for smaller
motorcycles.
   Its shareholders have benefited, too. Harley shares,
adjusted for June's 2-for-1 stock split, sell for $23, up
from the $5.50 initial public offering price in 1986. Last
year's net income surged 38% to a record $32.9 million, or an
adjusted $1.91 a share, on sales of $791 million. This year,
first-half profits were up 61%.
   Nevertheless, after six years of rapid sales growth,
Harley may soon face new hazards. Its Holiday Rambler RV
division is already in a slump, and the higher gasoline
prices since the Mideast crisis began bode ill for motor-home
sales. A recession could clobber both bike and RV sales.
   And Harley's motorcycles may be getting too fashionable.
The basic appeal of being bold and different loses something
when nearly everyone seems to be riding a Harley. A few years
ago, the company was happy to persuade Malcolm Forbes, Jay
Leno and Mickey Rourke to pose for its annual catalog. Today,
Harleys are the bike of choice in Hollywood. The unanswered
question: How many weekend rebels will remain loyal after
Hollywood turns to a new toy? "When they get tired of being
bikers, they'll go out and be yachtsmen or whatever the next
thing is," predicts Carl "Rodent" Metzger, a long-haired
photographer who travels the country taking pictures of
bikers.
   That thought has occurred to Harley and its advisers. It
is one reason the company diversified into RVs in late 1986.
   But Harley bets that innovations like HOG will help it
hold most of the new riders. Mr. Beals, the chairman, says
U.S. sales have grown steadily, without a sudden boom that
could lead to a bust. And officials think the fast-expanding
foreign sales, now running about 15,000 bikes a year, should
eventually approach those of the U.S. Exports to Japan are
rising, and the company is setting up HOG chapters in Europe.
   Harley even sees an untapped market in the U.S. To
encourage more women to ride, the company has formed a
"Ladies of Harley" club and come out with a new line of
tattoos for women. For those who aren't ready to make a
lifelong commitment, the tattoos are removable.
