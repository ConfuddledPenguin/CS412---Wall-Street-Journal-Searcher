   DALLAS -- J.E. Robert Co., an Alexandria, Va., real estate
concern, beat out a unit of NCNB Corp. for a $41.4 million
contract to manage and sell the commercial assets of a failed
Houston thrift.
   NCNB Texas National Bank had been managing the $3.8
billion in assets formerly owned by failed University Federal
Savings Association. The loss of the contract could result in
the layoff of as many as 300 NCNB Texas employees, a
spokeswoman for the bank said.

   NCNB Texas purchased the deposits and some University
Federal assets almost a year ago. The remaining assets were
managed by NCNB Texas under an interim contract with the
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created to dispose
of defunct thrifts and their assets.
   As the winning bidder, J.E. Robert will receive about
$41.4 million over three years for managing and selling $1.5
billion in nonperforming commercial loans and $835 million of
commercial real estate owned by University Federal. The bulk
of the real estate, valued at $569.2 million, is raw land.
   The management contract was the largest awarded to date by
the RTC. An agency spokesman said J.E. Robert's compensation
could be higher, depending on the speed of asset sales and
the sales amounts.
