   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. said it will lay off 800
workers as part of a production cutback at three tire plants.
   Goodyear, based in Akron, Ohio, blamed "continued
sluggishness" in vehicle production and a corporate effort to
reduce inventories for the cut in output.

   Goodyear said it will lay off 270 employees at the Union
City, Tenn., tire plant and 530 at the Valleyfield, Quebec,
facility. The company said the duration of the layoffs will
depend on tire demand.
   In addition, the Danville, Va., radial truck tire plant
will reduce production for one week, Goodyear said.
   Goodyear previously announced the layoff of 360 employees
at the Valleyfield plant.
   The company had a second-quarter loss of $9.4 million,
partly because of lower auto and truck output in North
America that led to a buildup of tire inventories and weak
replacement tire prices. Also, the company launched a
restructuring of North American tire sales and marketing that
will cut employment by 1,100 and led to a $21.4 million
restructuring charge.
