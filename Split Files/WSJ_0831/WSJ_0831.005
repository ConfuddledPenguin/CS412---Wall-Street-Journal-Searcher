   LONDON -- Since Saddam Hussein's troops rolled into
Kuwait, the smart Mideast money has rolled into Swiss francs,
German marks and even a little gold.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has sent shock waves throughout
the salons of wealthy individuals in the Middle East. Wealthy
people from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates to Oman
have bought billions of dollars of relatively stable Western
currencies and sold less-liquid securities and local
investments, according to bankers in London, Switzerland and
the U.S.

   Middle Eastern investors have moved as much as $8 billion
in capital outside the Gulf region since the Aug. 2 invasion,
bankers in Europe say. The capital flight is a potentially
damaging long-term blow to local efforts to establish
private-banking businesses in the region. And the main
beneficiaries of the outflow of capital are such big U.S.
banks as Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp, Bankers Trust Co.
and J.P. Morgan -- some of whose private-client operations in
the region have doubled since the invasion, bankers say. "We
have a host of new customers whom we weren't doing business
with last month," says a senior executive at an American bank
in Zurich, Switzerland.
   "There has been a flight to quality and safety," adds
George Asseily, director of London-based Schroder Asseily &amp;
Co., an investment and private-banking concern with strong
Mideast ties. "People are diversifying into stable
currencies, remaining fairly liquid and just waiting" for
some stability to return to the region.
   Peter Widmer, director in charge of institutional asset
management at Zurich's Bank Julius Baer, agrees: "People have
been looking for liquidity and safety. There has been a move
towards cash -- the Swiss franc, the Deutche mark and
possibly the dollar -- with less of a move towards gold."
   The flow of capital from the Mideast is affecting world
markets. Some people attribute the franc's near 10% rise
against the dollar this month largely to the invasion. Many
European bankers say that savvy Mideastern investors have
also been buying sterling, largely because real, or
inflation-adjusted, British interest rates of roughly 5% are
well above those for other major currencies.
   Despite the dollar's recent weakness, many Mideastern
investors have bought the U.S. currency. Bankers say
Mideasterners have also been trading volatile gold bullion,
whose price has swung by over 15% this month. However, their
interest hasn't been enough to compensate for big
institutional selling.
   The unprecedented wave of orders in the Middle East has
transformed the usually hushed tones and orderly manner of
Europe's private-banking halls. One London-based private
banker, pointing to stacks of telexes that cover his antique
Sheraton desk, says he has never before seen so many people
wanting accounts. "They all want to know how they can move
their money, and if we can set up accounts. It's
unbelievable," says the normally understated banker. Adds
Richard Lowe, a Chase Manhattan banker normally based in
Bahrain: "We have been extremely busy."
   The movement has prompted some unusual requests. "People
have asked us to secure safe passage for jewels," says a
banker at a U.S. bank in the Gulf. The crisis has meant a
boom for such specialists as British firms that store
investment-quality luxury automobiles. One such company,
which operates a garage in a converted cow shed in
Buckinghamshire, England, has received or expects nearly a
dozen high-cost luxury cars -- including two #250,000
($486,286) Lamborghinis from Bahrain and a Mercedes stretch
limousine from the Saudi royal family -- because of fears
that the vehicles would be damaged if hostilities escalate.
   The Gulf region is home for an estimated quarter of a
million so-called high-net-worth individuals. These wealthy
investors may control in total over $100 billion, bankers
say. Much of that money includes holdings in infrastructure
investments, as well as rights to oil income. Roughly 10% or
more is in such highly liquid assets as stocks, bonds and
cash.
   The safer havens are considered such European money
centers as London, Zurich, Geneva and the low-tax Channel
Islands of Jersey and Guernsey. These centers -- that permit
easy access to capital and often offer low tax rates -- are
more accessible than U.S. locations for people who want to
remain close to the Gulf. Bankers say as much as two-thirds
of the Middle Eastern capital has gone to Switzerland, with
the rest flowing to London and elsewhere. A typical portfolio
switched to 70% cash and 30% stocks and bonds since the
invasion from roughly equal distributions of cash, stocks and
bonds before.
   One group that isn't benefiting from the flight of capital
from the Gulf is the Japanese. Many Japanese financial
institutions have sharply curtailed their activity in the
Gulf since the Iraqi invasion. And few Japanese banks have
the private-banking facilities to try to tap wealthy
Mideastern investors. One Japanese banker says the
uncertainty in the region may be discouraging Japanese banks
from trying to exploit the situation -- and even putting a
chill on normal business in the region.
   Now that the money is out, it looks likely to stay out
until current tensions subside. "No one is going to rush back
into these countries," says one Mideast banker. "Long term,
they all have oil wealth, but short term, they seem too
unstable." A big casualty thus are the emerging
private-banking financial institutions of the Gulf, set up in
the region in recent years to tap some of the newly rich
Middle Easterners' wealth.
   Though many Arabs are trying to keep a low profile, the
sudden movement of wealth -- and the prospects of higher oil
prices -- has already generated some critical comment in
Europe. London tabloids this week reported a surge in
Mideastern interest in London homes on a scale unseen since
the 1970s petrodollar boom. And attention was drawn to an
obscure member of the Saudi royal family who recently lost a
reported $22 million at gambling casinos in the south of
France. Mentioning the gambling incident in this week's
Spectator magazine, author Charles Glass asked whether U.S.
and other soldiers in the multinational force are "going to
fight, kill and die so the sheik can try his luck again?"
