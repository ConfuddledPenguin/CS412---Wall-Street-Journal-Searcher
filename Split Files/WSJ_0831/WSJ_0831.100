   WASHINGTON -- The Congressional Budget Office released a
study concluding that cuts in the capital-gains tax "could
not be counted on to significantly boost output and increase
economic growth."
   The study runs directly counter to claims by the Bush
administration that its proposal to cut the tax on capital
gains would give a big boost to the economy and would pay for
itself.

   The new study was made public by House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). In it, the
congressional agency reviews eight different quantitative
analyses, including two by the CBO itself, of how a
capital-gains tax cut would affect savings, investment and
growth. Of the eight studies, five -- including both CBO
studies -- found that cutting taxes on capital gains is "not
likely to increase saving, investment and GNP much if at
all."
   Mr. Rostenkowski said the study suggests the best way to
boost economic growth isn't to cut the capital gains tax, but
rather "through successful conclusion of the budget summit
which would lower the budget deficit significantly over a
five-year period."
