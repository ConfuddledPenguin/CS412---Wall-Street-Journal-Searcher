   A rural county in northern California is threatening to
seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law.
   Should it seek bankruptcy protection, Butte County would
be the first county in U.S. history to do so, says the
National Association of Counties in Washington.

   Butte County is among roughly two dozen rural counties in
California, and scores more across the nation, that face
fiscal crises. In at least one state, distressed counties
have forced a measure onto the ballot calling for special aid
for counties and ending a practice whereby state governments
mandate services that counties must pay for.
   Butte suffers from this "mandated" problem as well, but it
has been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by a recent
decision by California's governor to veto a $20 million
bailout of Butte and other distressed counties.
   Will Randolph, Butte's chief administrator, said the
county's board of supervisors will make a final decision
about filing bankruptcy today. Absent a promise of relief
from the state, Mr. Randolph said, "the most likely scenario
is that we'll instruct our attorneys to file {for bankruptcy}
after Labor Day."
   Butte County has a population of roughly 150,000. Though
it includes the thriving city of Chico, home to a state
university, the unincorporated areas of the county are
generally poor. Mr. Randolph said that years of
budget-cutting in the 1980s have taken their toll.
