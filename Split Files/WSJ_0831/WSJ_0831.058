   DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia -- For the Americans who live and
work here in the oil fields, the worst time is 3 a.m.
   Because of the time difference, that's when the telephone
calls start pouring in from hysterical relatives back in the
U.S. who have just been frightened by the evening news.

   "You've got your mother on the phone and she's crying,"
explains Tom Harmon, a pilot. "It really did cause a lot of
people to leave."
   But the majority of Americans who have stayed are getting
by with a heavy dose of gallows humor. T-shirts have begun to
appear at the local shopping mall: "Visit Iraq Before Iraq
Visits You." Shannon Armstrong, an English teacher, has sent
home pictures of her 12-year-old daughter wearing a gas mask
as she leafs through a comic book.
   Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait earlier this month,
reports of impending school closings, evacuations and even
poison gas attacks have bombarded Aramco Camp, the community
where some 10,000 foreign workers of the Saudi Arabian Oil
Co. live. Almost invariably the panicky reports come from the
U.S. So far, the reports have all been wrong.
   This scattering of sand-colored one-story ranch houses may
be the most protected community in the world. To get here,
the Iraqis would have to cross about 200 miles of desert,
fighting their way through the Royal Saudi Army and troops
from several neighboring countries. Then they would have to
overwhelm a growing portion of the U.S. Army and Marine
Corps, while evading the combined air power of the Army, Air
Force and Navy.
   Any Iraqi troops that did make it here would then have to
contend with the Saudi Aramco guards at the gate, who reject
most outsiders.
   Nonetheless, more than 3,000 dependents have left, and
more are considering following them. But most are staying on.
"I thought about it (leaving)," says Mr. Harmon's wife,
McAndrew "Mickey" Harmon, "and I decided I just can't take
all that jet lag."
   Her decision became more questionable after Bryant Gumbel,
host of NBC's "Today" show, closed the local school. During a
whirlwind visit here last week, Mr. Gumbel reported that
Dhahran Academy, with 1,300 students, was "closing its
doors."
   "I don't know where he got that information," says an
angry Don Kirkpatrick, head of the private-school system that
runs the academy and nine other schools here. "I've gotten
calls from all over the States."
   Mr. Kirkpatrick says he tried three times to reach Mr.
Gumbel at his hotel here to request a correction, but wasn't
able to get through. Now his problem is to notify teachers
and students vacationing in the U.S. that school really does
start Sept. 8, as scheduled. A spokeswoman for NBC says it
stands by its story.
   A spokesman for Saudi Aramco says the company was miffed
by another U.S. television report that oil workers were being
evacuated from Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, which
includes Dhahran. At the time, the spokesman says, the
company didn't even have an evacuation plan. It was beginning
to study some old contingency plans. One, which called for an
evacuation to Beirut, obviously needed more work.
   Some Americans wouldn't think of leaving, rumors or not.
Virginia Charlton, an English teacher, has been here 19
years. She doesn't want to leave her prized Arabian horse. "I
have a cousin who lives in North Carolina. She's a cop who
wears a gun, and every day she faces more danger than I do.
She calls me up in the night and demands I get out of here."
   Others are attached to the camp golf course, an arena of
sand where the fairways, called "browns," are heavily oiled.
To hit with an iron off the brown, a golfer puts down a
little square of artificial grass and hits off that. "It
gives you a much better lie," explains one.
   Last weekend some of the 200-plus international reporters,
photographers and TV crewmen arriving here to cover the Gulf
crisis were being driven in buses across the desert near the
Iraqi border. During a long day they passed thousands of
Saudi soldiers without stopping.
   Then they saw one wearing a gas mask. The buses stopped.
Photographers and television crews piled out with their
equipment. By evening, the lone soldier's insectlike visage
was all over the globe. And after midnight, the phones in
Aramco Camp started ringing.
