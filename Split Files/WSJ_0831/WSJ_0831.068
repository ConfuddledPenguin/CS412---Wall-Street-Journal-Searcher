   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan's surprise decision to raise
its benchmark interest rate could ultimately sour global
economic prospects, analysts said. And depending on the
effects of the Mideast crisis, the central bank may have to
boost the rate again.
   In what the bank said was a pre-emptive strike against
inflation, the Bank of Japan on Thursday increased the
discount rate to 6% from 5.25%. The rise was the fifth
increase in the rate, which the central bank charges on loans
to financial institutions, since May 1989. The rate is now at
its highest level since Dec. 11, 1981. Financial markets,
nervous for several days because of rumors of an imminent
rate rise, were unscathed by the announcement itself.

   By raising the discount rate in the midst of the Persian
Gulf crisis, the central bank has left open the possibility
that it may have to act again. Even before the Bank of Japan
announced the move, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. was saying that any
rate increase announced now would probably have to be
repeated to temper inflationary pressures in Japan.
   "They spent some precious ammunition" in raising the
discount rate now, said a foreign-exchange dealer at a U.S.
bank in Tokyo. "Next time, they'll be playing a higher-stakes
game." He said he fears that tighter credit in Japan could
have a ripple effect, prompting rate increases in other
countries.
   Economists said the threat won't diminish as long as the
confrontation between U.S.-led forces in the Gulf and Iraq
continues and the price of oil, on which Japan depends for
most of its energy, stays high. The economists said a
sustained increase in oil prices or a disruption in supply
could cause an inflationary spike in Japan that would have to
be met with still higher rates.
   Higher interest rates naturally tend to damp spending and
slow economic growth. The Bank of Japan, in fact, said its
main goal in raising the discount rate was to temper demand
and thus discourage higher prices in the world's second
largest economy.
   The big concern among economists is that monetary
authorities -- in Japan and then elsewhere -- may have to
tighten credit further. For Japan, where the economy is
growing at an annual pace of nearly 5%, that isn't a huge
worry. But for the U.S., where the annual rate of growth is
only slightly more than 1%, higher interest rates could spell
recession.
   "Higher rates would be very counterproductive from an
international point of view," said Keikichi Honda, Bank of
Tokyo Ltd.'s director of research.
   Chris Tanner, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities Ltd., said, "We have very serious worries about
what would happen if they continued to raise rates."
   Some analysts said a global rate-increase spiral doesn't
appear imminent. They said the Bank of Japan seems simply to
have realigned official rates with expectations and with
already high market interest rates -- a motive the Bank of
Japan governor, Yasushi Mieno, mentioned at a news
conference.
   Financial markets appeared almost relieved by the rate
change. The dollar rebounded against the yen, climbing to
144.10 yen in Tokyo trading from 143.60 yen late Wednesday in
New York. In theory, higher Japanese interest rates should
attract money to the yen and cause the Japanese currency to
strengthen, but currency dealers said the rate change already
had been taken into account before the announcement.
   The dollar's resilience should come as a relief to the
Bank of Japan, analysts said. Had the dollar weakened sharply
against the yen, the U.S. Federal Reserve might have felt
obliged to raise its interest rates. "If this decision had
been postponed for another month or more, there would have
been a greater possibility of a precipitous fall in the
dollar" as investors continued to buy yen in anticipation of
a rate rise, said Nobuyuki Ueda, senior economist at LongTerm
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. "That could {have led} to a great
change in the world economy."
   Stock and bond markets also took the discount-rate
increase in stride. The Nikkei index soared 775.17 points, or
3.1%, to 25669.96 after falling 815.97 points Wednesday. The
bellwether 10-year govenment bond surged 0.83 point to 82.97,
to yield 8.115%.
