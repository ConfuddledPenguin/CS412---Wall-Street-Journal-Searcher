   Henkel said that it expects "the positive profit
development . . . to continue through the second half," but
that "risks might come from raw-material prices and from
currency fluctuations."
   Sales volume rose 6%, Henkel said. Of total sales, 72%
were exports. Though Henkel didn't provide earnings or sales
data for its divisions, it said chemical sales rose 2%,
mostly on a rise in volume, and cited good sales increases
for organic specialty chemicals, additives for plastics, and
paint and coatings. But it said sales were pressured by
weakness in customer industries in other areas. It said U.S.
business developed favorably. Cosmetics and toiletry sales
rose 11%, mostly because of high domestic sales and an early
start in the new East German market. Detergent and household
cleanser sales rose 4%, mostly from higher exports.
