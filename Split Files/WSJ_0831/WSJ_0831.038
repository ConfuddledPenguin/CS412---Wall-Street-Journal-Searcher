   WASHINGTON -- Contributions from political action
committees to candidates running for federal office continued
to rise during the past 18 months, with incumbents receiving
far more than their challengers, according to a Federal
Election Commission report.
   The report said that from Jan. 1, 1989, to June 30, 1990,
PACs contributed almost $94 million to candidates running for
federal office, up 6.1% from the 1988 period and up 32% from
1986. Overall, PACs contributed more than $101 million to
federal officeholders and their challengers, but about $7
million of that was given to candidates raising money for
future campaigns or retiring past debts.

   As in past reports, the election commission said that
incumbents fared better than their challengers, receiving $79
million compared with only $6.5 million.
   Corporate PACs were the most generous, contributing $35
million to federal officeholders and their challengers. Trade
group and health-related PACs were next, giving $26 million,
followed by labor PACs, with $20 million.
   Democrats enjoyed a greater share of PAC largess than did
their Republican counterparts, receiving $59 million compared
with $34 million.
   The Realtors Political Action Committee led all PAC
contributions, giving more than $1.5 million. American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. led corporate PAC contributions,
giving slightly more than $1.1 million, while the Teamsters
committee led labor PACs, with contributions of more than
$1.3 million.
