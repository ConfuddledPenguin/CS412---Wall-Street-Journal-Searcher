   NEW YORK -- The dollar surged when currency speculators
who had bet that the Bank of Japan would raise its discount
rate booked profits after their bet paid off.
   As expected, the Japanese central bank raised its
benchmark rate to 6% from 5.25% -- a 0.75 percentage point
increase, or no more than the market had expected. A cloud of
uncertainty over the dollar-yen rate was lifted, and dealers
were relieved that the increase was no larger.

   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
144.35 yen, above 143.60 yen late Wednesday in New York.
Against the mark, the dollar climbed to 1.5640 marks from
1.5595 marks.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
144.40 yen, up from 144.10 yen at the close there Thursday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.5635 marks,
down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5666 marks.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
144.40 yen, up from 144.10 yen at the close there Thursday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.5635 marks,
down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5666 marks.
   Pressure to buy dollars had been building ever since the
dollar's nearly 10% overall decline in the past three months,
culminated recently in record lows against the mark and Swiss
franc. Opinion has grown that the dollar's newest bottom of
1.5385 marks, set Monday, will be a short-term turning point.
   Yesterday's bidding provided the dollar with the same
rebound accorded on Monday to the yen.
   Month-end accounting requirements, coming before a long
weekend in the U.S. and Canada, further spurred profit-taking
and position-squaring by dealers who want a clean slate for
the fall.
   The market had "run out of reasons to sell the dollar,"
said John Blackley, chief dealer at Bank of Scotland in
London.
   As the dollar rose, profit-taking pushed sterling down to
$1.9224 from $1.9460 late Wednesday. The pound also fell to
3.0066 marks from 3.0348 marks.
   Though the Bank of Japan dominated conversations Thursday,
the yen wasn't the center of trading.
   The Japanese currency's failure to rally in Asian trading
immediately after the central bank announcement signaled the
opportunity to buy back dollars, said Keith Raphael, a Chase
Manhattan vice president, but afterward "it was a
dollar-based move." He noted that the yen hardly budged
against its European counterparts.
   In this respect, yesterday's action was different from the
market's reaction the last time the Japanese discount rate
was lifted March 20. That day, the dollar also gained, rising
a whole yen as the market registered its disappointment with
the size -- one point -- and timing -- late -- of the move.
But the difference was that the yen dominated trading.
   This was the fifth discount-rate increase in little over a
year.
   Some Japanese traders said a full point rise this time
would have produced a different reaction. "People in the
foreign-exchange market digested 0.75 {percentage point}
almost completely" before the move, said Katsumi Asako, chief
corporate dealer at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo.
   Robert A. Brusca, Nikko Secuities chief economist,
insisted that the yen fared well yesterday considering the
rate rise was "very heavily discounted in the market."
   The dollar ended stronger in Europe yesterday, boosted by
technical factors and short covering.
   In other European activity, the Bank of Spain confirmed it
had sold dollars for pesetas as the Spanish unit neared 97.80
pesetas to the dollar. The Spanish central bank didn't
disclose the amount of dollars sold, but noted that the
intervention was relatively small.
   The peseta lost strength against the dollar at the start
of Madrid trading, weakened by a report in the Thursday issue
of the Financial Times forecasting a slowdown of the recent
rapid growth of Spain's economy.
   In active Asian trading, the dollar ended in Tokyo
Thursday at 144.10 yen, below 144.35 yen late Wednesday in
Tokyo.
   The Reserve Bank of Australia moved into a soft
Australian-dollar market during the Asian afternoon and
bulldozed the currency down further to 82 cents, Sydney
dealers said.
   By late Thursday in New York the Australian dollar was
quoted at 81.67 cents, down from 83.12 cents late Wednesday.
   Some Sydney traders said large Japanese investors joined
the selling, hastening the currency's fall. Others disagreed,
saying Japanese buyers picked the currency off its lows.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $386.70 an ounce, up $1.40. Estimated
volume was a moderate four million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $388.50 an ounce.
