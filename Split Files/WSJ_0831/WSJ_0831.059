   MONTVALE, N.J. -- Mercedes-Benz of North America will
introduce next month the first Mercedes model in two years to
sell for less than $30,000.
   But prices of other 1991 Mercedes cars will rise as much
as 6.9% from a year ago, the U.S. sales arm of the German
luxury auto maker Daimler-Benz AG said.

   Mercedes said it is launching a lower-priced version of
its 190 E sedan, starting at $28,050, because the company
"didn't want to abandon" buyers in the lower end of the
luxury segment.
   The new 190 E model will come with a 2.3 liter
four-cylinder engine and a manual transmission. The regular
190 E model has a 2.6 liter engine; it will start at $32,800
for the 1991 model year, up 2.6% from a year ago.
   Mercedes's decision to climb down the price ladder follows
a similar strategic shift by German rival BMW AG. BMW earlier
this year introduced a new "entry-level" BMW 318is model with
a base price of $21,500.
   Mercedes-Benz and BMW both are trying to regain ground
lost when they boosted prices sharply during the late 1980s,
in part reflecting the relative weakness of the dollar vs.
the German mark. As these price increases pushed the cost of
the cheapest Mercedes above the $30,000 level, sales
suffered. Mercedes sold 75,714 cars in the U.S. last year,
down 24% from the peak in 1986. In 1988, Mercedes offered
special "bumper-to-bumper" warranties on used Mercedes in an
effort to lure customers who couldn't afford to pay $30,000
or more for new cars. The company said it hoped these buyers
eventually would come back for brand new Mercedes.
   In addition, Mercedes, like BMW, is now trying to fend off
stiff competition from new luxury models fielded by Japanese
auto makers. These Japanese cars offer comparable comfort and
performance to the German models, but cost thousands less.
   The 190 E, for example, faces potential competition from
Honda Motor Co.'s Acura Legend and Integra, Toyota Motor
Corp.'s Lexus ES 250 sedan, and Nissan Motor Corp.'s Infiniti
M 30 coupe and G20 sedan. The new G20 is due out next month.
Acura is expected to introduce a new Legend later this fall.
All these cars start under $30,000. Volkswagen AG's Audi of
America division also fields models that compete with the 190
E.
