   PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia -- The moment of economic truth is
approaching for Czechoslovakia.
   Since its anti-Communist revolution last November, the
second most industrialized member -- after East Germany -- of
the former Soviet bloc has hesitated to apply a full dose of
market medicine. Many in President Vaclav Havel's government
didn't want to inflict radical changes that would be certain
to result in huge price rises and high unemployment on the
populace. And, with the nation's stores reasonably
well-stocked and living standards fairly high in Eastern
European terms, the new leaders felt little pressure for
immediate action.

   Now, that pressure is building rapidly. Although concrete
action will come after Parliament reconvenes in September,
officials say that a series of recent external jolts are
pushing the Prague government to overcome its remaining
resistance to rapid economic reform.
   First, the Soviet Union abruptly reduced oil deliveries,
creating gasoline lines and forcing a sharp reduction in
Czechoslovak exports to the Soviet Union, the destination
last year for two-fifths of the country's exports. Trade
tensions are expected to worsen next year when the Soviets
start insisting on payment in hard currency for their oil.
   Then, East German companies, after German monetary union
on July 1, began refusing payment in non-convertible
Czechoslovak crowns and breaking contracts to supply
Czechoslovak factories. East Germany has been
Czechoslovakia's second largest trading partner after the
Soviet Union, supplying crucial machinery and chemicals.
   Finally, higher world oil prices stemming from the Persian
Gulf crisis closed off one potential partial escape from the
country's energy crisis. Czechoslovakia had hoped to recoup
in the form of oil a $300 million loan to Iraq. Instead, it
has adopted the United Nations sanctions against Baghdad
resulting from its invasion of Kuwait and may never recoup
the money.
   "Our sense of complacency is being replaced by a sense of
urgency," says Karel Dyba, finance minister of the Czech
republic. "Our markets are fading away, and unless we act and
act quickly, our economy could collapse."
   So far, the government has responded only by raising
gasoline prices 50% at the start of the month, a move that
eased lines at gas stations.
   Negotiations about the canceled East German contracts have
been opened with West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich
Genscher. The East Germans have stopped sending the Czechs
agricultural machinery and fertilizer and no longer buy
Czechoslovak cars, trucks and machine tools. Czechoslovak
Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier says he hopes Bonn will come
forward with a significant sum of marks in compensation for
the broken contracts. A spokesman for the West German Foreign
Ministry confirmed that Bonn will compensate for any broken
contracts.
   "The East Germans have broken more than 400 cooperative
agreements, and many of our factories will have to close,"
Mr. Dienstbier says. "Somebody has to pay for the losses."
   Officials admit, however, that diplomacy won't solve the
economy's fundamental problems. Legislation is needed to
create a full-fledged market economy. In September, a new
company law, based on West German and Austrian legislation,
will be ready for Parliament. If approved, it would transform
state enterprises into joint stock companies, paving the way
for their privatization.
   In October, a restitution law will be introduced,
detailing property nationalized by the Communists that former
owners now may reclaim. Although Czechoslovakia already has
begun giving some disputed properties confiscated by the
Communists back to religious groups, the absence of a
comprehensive law has been a powerful deterrent to potential
foreign investors.
   "Foreigners don't know who the owners of property are, and
as long as there is no clearly defined owner, they will not
come to Czechoslovakia," says Jiri Pehe, a Czechoslovak
analyst at Radio Free Europe in Munich.
   Price reform represents another potential boost for
foreign investors. On Jan. 1, price controls are scheduled to
be lifted except on food and fuel, and the Czechoslovak crown
is to be made convertible. Convertibility will end the
complicated system of varying exchange rates, the so-called
business rate of about 15 crowns to the dollar and the
tourist rate of about 25 crowns to the dollars.
   "We must free prices, not gradually, but quickly" to adapt
to the "new trade conditions with Russia and Germany," says
Mr. Dyba. He says the decisive move could come even before
Jan. 1. "We may not be able to wait that long."
   Despite the forces pressing for quick action, there
remains much controversy about several elements of the
planned reforms. For example, foreigners can own 100% of a
Czechoslovak company, but they still can't own land. "This
contradiction will have to be clarified," says Radio Free
Europe's Mr. Pehe.
   Another dispute concerns the speed of privatization. One
group within the government "says there is no need to move
fast with privatization, that it would be better first to
improve management and create joint stock companies," says
Zdenek Draibek, an economist with the World Bank serving as
an adviser to the Czech government. "The others say ownership
is important, that we cannot get significant improvement
unless the owner is clearly identified."
   In the past, President Havel has proved unwilling to
settle such debates among his economic advisers, saying that
he is a philosopher, not an economist, and that the advisers
must settle their own disagreements. The result has been a
confusing muddle of hesitations and half-reforms. But, in the
new government named in June, one of the chief go-slow
proponents, Valtr Komarek, was dropped from his post of
deputy prime minister.
   "The fast reformers have won," says Jaroslaw Jiru, foreign
editor at Prague daily Lidove Noviny. "They will get the laws
they want."
   However, the true reckoning will come after the market
legislation goes into effect. If the resulting pain to
citizens is too great, either because of high prices or high
unemployment, many fear a social explosion could result.
   "There is no other solution except to go fast on the
economy," Mr. Jiru says. "But nothing is won in advance."
