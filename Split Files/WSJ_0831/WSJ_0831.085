   When the 101st Congress draws to a close, American
business may be faced with new and hostile federal laws and
regulations governing the workplace, including those dealing
with handicap discrimination, expansion of civil rights
litigation, mandated parental leave, federal regulation of
child care and Occupational Safety and Health Administration
criminal penalties. Active in all of these issues are the
leadership and lobbyists of organized labor -- which is
quietly working on an ambitious legislative agenda.
   The last big union legislative push, the labor law reform
effort of the late 1970s, met its end in a Senate filibuster.
And in the 12 years since then, much has changed for both
labor and business. American business has undergone major
restructuring since the late 1970s. Labor has not. Unions
today are losing members, losing strikes and losing
elections. So the labor movement is reverting to the
pessimistic and destructive strategy of seeking a legislative
bailout as a quick fix to its problems. The labor agenda is
burgeoning with initiatives. Unfortunately, many of the
pending bills -- bills addressing labor or social issues --
promote conflict and litigation rather than resolution and
conciliation of workplace disputes.

   Most advanced until recently has been the anti-dual-shop
legislation, which is designed to restructure the
construction industry in a form more to the liking of the
building and construction trades unions. This legislation
would widen union contracts to include what are now open-shop
contractors and automatically impose unionization on
thousands of nonunion workers without a vote. This year bills
that would assist unions in packing the National Labor
Relations Board, certifying unions without secret ballots or
ensuring "quickie elections" have been introduced in
Congress. But by far the most significant piece of labor
legislation in the works is the "Striker Replacement Bill,"
which would outlaw the hiring of permanent replacement
workers during labor disputes.
   The proposal was introduced this year by Rep. William Clay
(D., Mo.) and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) amid claims
that the strike weapon is currently ineffective. Unions
assert that there is no meaningful right to strike when
employers are permitted to replace strikers permanently. The
legislation would prohibit employers from hiring permanent
replacements and prevent strikers who want to return to work
from receiving any form of preference after the labor
dispute.
   Some have argued the legislation is not likely to become
law in this congress. But it retains important advocates.
Teamsters President and AFL-CIO Vice-President William
McCarthy, for example, has said unions will not contribute to
fall candidates who oppose the legislation in this fall's
election. The second House hearing of the bill -- there has
been one in the Senate -- is scheduled for Sept. 19. If the
bill fails to become law this year unions say the issue is
certain to be the highest priority item for labor in the
102nd Congress.
   Although an emotional grabber, the striker replacement
legislation is devoid of merit, and is hostile to business,
American competitiveness and the individual worker. The
honest answer to the complaint about strikers losing their
jobs is that workers knowingly assumed such a risk when they
choose to engage in economic warfare against their employers.
Since the origins of a federal labor policy, the law has
recognized two parallel rights: A worker's right to strike
and an employer's right to stay open during a strike by
hiring permanent replacement workers.
   Unions claim that President Reagan's firing of the air
traffic controllers taught management that it could get away
with resisting labor's demands. It is far more truthful to
recognize that foreign competition and consumer demands
compel management to take hard bargaining positions. American
management can often no longer afford to shut down their
companies' operations during strikes. It is disingenuous to
point to President Reagan as the reason that the consuming
public no longer has patience for union self-help tactics.
Nor is it logical for labor to denounce replacement workers
who are enticed by high salaries (as much as $38,000 in one
case) from which the union members walk away.
   The simple, underlying motivation of the Striker
Replacement legislation is power-union power. The bill would
take away what is frequently an employer's only defense
against unreasonable union bargaining demands. If a union
could strike without fear that its members might be replaced,
the strike would be used as often as a Saturday Night
special. This is not mere speculation; the sponsors of the
bill themselves assert that it will enable unions to use the
strike weapon more frequently.
   Today's economic climate is perhaps the best context for
understanding the deleterious effects of the legislation.
Recession looms. Under current law, labor is obliged to come
to the bargaining table in times like these ready to consider
sacrifices. If management were forbidden to hire replacement
workers during strikes, unions would be empowered to force
concessions from businesses already on the ropes, and to
exalt organized labor's interests above those of
shareholders, creditors and customers -- and workers
themselves.
   The striker replacement legislation's effects would be
wide. The law would apply not only to strikes, but to all
"labor disputes," apparently including union organizing
campaigns, informational picketing and sympathy actions.
Nonunion businesses are also subjected to the bill's effects.
Under current law, a "labor dispute" occurs anytime two or
more workers walk off a job to protest terms or conditions of
employment. Such striking nonunion workers, under the
proposed legislation, could not be permanently replaced;
anytime the strikers decide to return to work (a day, a week,
six months later), they would have to be reinstated and their
replacements fired.
   The Senate version of the legislation applies to airlines
and railroads as well. In those industries, where secondary
boycotts are still legal, Congress would be creating
incentives for labor to shut down the nation's entire
transportation network to enforce union demands at one
carrier.
   Further, the legislation would discriminate against
workers who want to work and need to work during a labor
dispute. It would prohibit employers from considering
seniority, experience, skills and training earned by
employees during work stoppages.
   Employees may be forced to work during a labor dispute out
of economic necessity, or may fundamentally disagree with the
union over the calling of the strike. Without regard to the
reason, experience confirms that nonstrikers and crossovers
are frequently the targets of the most outrageous instances
of physical abuse and verbal harassment. This legislation
enforces union solidarity -- with the imprimatur of the
Congress -- in every labor dispute by punishing workers.
