   Don't Tell Him Those in the East

   CHICAGO -- Kevin Riberdy spent the summer updating his
employer's mailing list. To do so, he talked to 450 corporate
receptionists across the country.
   That explains how he devised a new measure of the business
climate: the rudeness ranking of office receptionists.

   New York City and New Jersey won't receive the news well.
Judged the most discourteous, receptionists there were "very
abrupt, wouldn't let me finish sentences and gave me the
runaround," he says. One New Jersey receptionist would only
check on one executive per call, making him ring back three
times.
   By Mr. Riberdy's courtesy count, East Hartford, Conn.,
Foxboro, Mass., and Danbury, Conn., also could use some
lessons in manners. Frequently, he says, receptionists would
sigh, as if thinking, "Oh my God, here's another one of them
calling."
   Midwestern receptionists, he says, were the most helpful.
"They would always ask a service-type question, such as, `How
can I help you?'" says Mr. Riberdy, a high school literature
teacher who worked this summer for a management consulting
firm (which seeks anonymity, for obvious reasons). Topping
the friendly list: receptionists in Wisconsin -- especially
Racine and Milwaukee -- Tulsa, Okla., and Cleveland.
   Mr. Riberdy also gives high marks to Southern
receptionists -- especially in Tennessee -- who he says were
"pretty friendly and willing to take time to help answer
questions." He says that while receptionists on the West
Coast "weren't as harsh" as Easterners, they didn't meet the
high standards of those in Wisconsin.
   Receptionists at many companies "make you feel they are
too busy to deal with you," says Mr. Riberdy. That's a nono,
says Nancy Friedman, a consultant in St. Louis who offers
advice on office manners and calls herself the "Telephone
Doctor." Her cardinal rule of customer service is: "Be
friendly before you know who it is." (Ms. Friedman also
thinks Midwesterners are first-rate: The first winner of her
annual Friendliest Voice contest, in 1988, was from Racine,
and last year's winner was from Wabash, Ind.)
   Automation is no solution to rudeness, in Mr. Riberdy's
view. At least 40 companies had automatic telephone answering
systems that require a caller to press buttons to direct a
call to the right person. He's especially upset with a
company that put him through three layers of automation
before "I got a recording to call back {later}."
