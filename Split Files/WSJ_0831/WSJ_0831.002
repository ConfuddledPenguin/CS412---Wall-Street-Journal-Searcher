   WASHINGTON -- Some large U.S. corporations now favor
weakening anti-dumping laws, and this rift in the business
community threatens to undercut congressional support for a
new global trading accord.
   Most U.S. manufacturers still adhere to the traditional
position of rigorously protecting American companies from
imports that are "dumped" -- that is, sold at less than their
assumed costs. But U.S. multinational companies are
increasingly interested in weakening the anti-dumping rules,
and thus are allying themselves with trading competitors of
the U.S., such as Japan and South Korea.

   Leading the drive to water down the anti-dumping rules are
giant companies such as International Business Machines
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Caterpillar Inc. and Cargill Inc.
Many of these multinationals rely heavily on foreign
components or raw materials; strict enforcement of current
anti-dumping rules raises the costs of these imports.
   Moreover, these companies have become large exporters and
thus are vulnerable to other nations' anti-dumping actions.
Donald Fites, Caterpillar's president and chairman-elect,
contends that unless the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, the group that sets rules for world trade, acts to
prevent what he sees as abuses of the anti-dumping code, such
actions could become "the protectionist weapon of choice in
the 1990s."
   On the other side are many U.S. industries -- such as
steel, automotive, ball-bearings, glass and textiles -- that
have been the victims of dumping. They are pressing the
administration to seek a toughening of the rules, or at least
to get the GATT negotiators to leave them alone.
   These proponents of strong anti-dumping laws also claim
considerable clout in Congress. Caucus leaders claiming to
represent as many as 300 House votes have warned President
Bush that they will oppose any agreement that "substantially
weakens" the anti-dumping laws.
   The conflicting demands could hurt the Bush
administration's ability to win quick congressional approval
for a new accord under GATT, which it hopes to send to
Capitol Hill next year.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who believes the U.S.
anti-dumping law is the only shield some industries have
against predatory imports, vows that the U.S. won't accept a
code that "diminishes the rights and remedies available to
U.S. firms."
   But U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills has overall
responsibility for coordinating the U.S. position in the
current round of GATT negotiations. As it draws to a
conclusion in December, she will be trying to bundle all the
GATT issues into a single package that the U.S. and more than
100 other nations can agree on. At that point, advocates of a
strong anti-dumping code worry, Mrs. Hills may give up part
of the U.S. position on dumping in order to gain important
trade benefits in other areas.
   "Some countries will whisper, give us some changes in the
anti-dumping code if you want an agreement in agriculture,
services and investments," says Alan Wolff, trade counsel for
the Semiconductor Industry Association.
   Making matters even more worrisome for Mr. Wolff and his
clients is the new congruity of interests between some U.S.
multinationals and trade adversaries such as Japan and South
Korea. Like the multinationals, the Japanese want the new
GATT code to accept the practice of "forward-pricing," or
spreading capital and research costs over the entire
projected life of a product, allowing exporters to ship
products at less than their current costs. This would reverse
the current U.S. practice.
   Japan, Canada and the U.S. multinationals also are jointly
pressing the Bush administration to accept a "sunset"
provision in the GATT code, which would require member
countries to terminate anti-dumping duties after a specific
period of time. The European Community already has a
five-year sunset provision, but under current U.S. practice,
anti-dumping orders remain in effect until it can be shown
that the goods in question have been landed at non-dumped
prices for three consecutive years.
   There are obvious reasons for this unanimity of views
between major U.S. exporters and Japan. Until the mid-1980s,
only the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the European Community
had active anti-dumping programs. Now at least 27 countries
have adopted similar laws, including Argentina, Brazil,
Mexico and Chile.
   As a result, U.S. companies are finding themselves on the
receiving end of anti-dumping actions. Mexico alone has
directed at least 15 against them since 1987, according to
the International Trade Commission. "The U.S. now ranks up
there with Japan as the leading targets of anti-dumping
actions," says Gary Horlick, a trade lawyer advising IBM,
Caterpillar and other multinationals.
   The Commerce Department is resisting the pressure to
change. Eric Garfinkel, the department's assistant secretary
for import administration, acknowledges that the U.S. and the
European Community are practically the only two parties in
GATT that oppose weakening the code.
