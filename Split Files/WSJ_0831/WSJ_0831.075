   WARNING FOR EUROPE'S AIRLINES

   Europe's airports and airspace cannot meet the needs of
the future unless airlines and national governments work
together to improve the industry's creaking infrastructure,
warned Karl-Heinz Neumeister, secretary-general of the
Association of European Airlines.
   "I don't understand how policy-makers can seek a
barrier-free market on the ground for 1992 and not allow the
same for the air," the official told an aerospace and
transport conference in London.
   At present, European air-traffic control is a patchwork of
42 centers and 22 systems with different standards and
communications procedures. Mr. Neumeister said inefficiency
is responsible for 8% of the price of an airline ticket.
   Mr. Neumeister said that although the airlines had the
money to finance the creation of a single European
traffic-control system, they lacked the power to implement
change without political consent from governments.
                                                                                                       

   NO SRI LANKAN TEA FOR IRAQ
                                                                                                       

   Sri Lanka will stop selling tea to Iraq in compliance with
sanctions imposed by the United Nations as punishment for
Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, a cabinet minister said. "We have
got clarification from the U.N. that tea cannot be an
exception to the sanctions of food items to Iraq," said
Plantation Minister Ranjan Wijeratne. Sri Lanka had hoped
that it would be permitted to continue selling tea to Iraq,
which last year bought 30,000 tons of Sri Lankan tea --
nearly 24% of the Indian Ocean island's export crop.
Bangladesh, another of Iraq's chief tea sources, barred Iraqi
buyers from its tea auctions earlier in the week.

   CIGARETTE-SHORTAGE CASUALTY
                                                                                                       

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev dismissed one of his
top ministers yesterday, blaming him for the acute shortage
of cigarettes that has caused demonstrations in Moscow and
other cities. Vladilen Nikitin, a first deputy prime minister
and head of the State Procurement Commission, was relieved of
his duties one day after Mr. Gorbachev summoned him and other
officials to demand an explanation for the shortages.
                                                                                                       

   SINGAPORE'S FOREIGN WORKERS
                                                                                                       

   Singapore, suffering from a severe labor shortage, said it
was relaxing restrictions on hiring foreign workers. The
government now allows foreign maids and overseas workers in
the manufacturing, shipyard, hotel and construction sectors.
A Labor Ministry statement said the government had decided to
"progressively allow other sectors of the economy also to
recruit foreign workers" with immediate effect. It didn't
specify which sectors.
                                                                                                       

   KOREAN AGREEMENT
                                                                                                       

   North and South Korea agreed on details of talks between
their prime ministers scheduled for next week, a South Korean
government spokesman said. "The two sides concluded all
procedural matters for the high-level talks to be held in
Seoul from Sept. 4," the spokesman said after liaison
officials from the two governments met in the border village
of Panmunjom. The two countries agreed to hold two rounds of
prime ministers' talks in the South Korean capital and
confirmed the itinerary for the North Korean delegates'
four-day stay in Seoul.
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINE PROTECTIONISM
                                                                                                       

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino bowed to protectionist
demands and suspended her order for sweeping tariff cuts, an
action likely to undermine attempts to make the ailing
Philippine economy more competitive internationally. In an
unexpected reversal, Mrs. Aquino ordered that the lower
tariffs, which were to have taken effect tomorrow, be held
"in abeyance" while the two houses of Congress try to draw up
a resolution calling for a six-month delay in implementation.
                                                                                                       

   AIDS TESTING IN ZIMBABWE
                                                                                                       

   Life-insurance companies in Zimbabwe said AIDS-related
claims in that nation have tripled in the past year and
announced they would require medical tests from policy
applicants.
   To sidestep local laws prohibiting selective AIDS testing,
the companies increased the minimum life-policy payout to the
equivalent of $40,000, the amount that allows insurance
organizations to legally screen clients for AIDS. "We had to
raise the sum because so many policyholders are dying of
AIDS," industry spokesman Nalin Kapadia said.
   At least 9,000 people have AIDS in Zimbabwe, and about
466,000 are estimated to be carriers of the virus that causes
the disease.
   The insurers' announcement was rare in Africa, where few
governments have admitted the full extent of the AIDS
epidemic in their countries.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Beijing's zoo moved its pandas, the mascots of next
month's Asian Games, out of poorly ventilated, cramped
quarters into luxury. Liang Liang, Ling Ling and War War now
occupy air-conditioned cages in a new 2.5-acre panda house
that cost the zoo $1.38 million to build. . . . The
55-year-old son of former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev
will do research and teach a seminar this fall at Harvard
University's Institute of Politics, university officials
said. Sergei Khrushchev, an engineer who specializes in
rocket-guidance systems, will become a fellow at the
institute in late October, Harvard said.
