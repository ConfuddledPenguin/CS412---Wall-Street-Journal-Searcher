   BIG SKY, Mont. -- Walkin' Jim Stoltz can't stop. Every
year for the past 17, he has walked in the wilds, with 60 or
so pounds of camping gear, dried fruit, pasta and a guitar on
his back. This summer, he has been walking in the heart of
Montana, adding 600 miles to the 17,000 miles he has walked
so far.
   Mr. Stoltz, a tall, scrawny 37-year-old, composes songs
about his life in the back country and takes thousands of
pictures -- of sunsets and sunrises, of streams, lodgepole
pines and eagles. He presents his songs and slides to
preservation and school groups in a multimedia show called
Forever Wild.

   Walkin' Jim isn't a pushy guy, but if his concerts inspire
someone to take a hike, he figures that's good, and if he
arouses people to join his campaign to save the wilderness,
that's even better. "A lot of my audiences on the East and
West coasts are unaware that the wilderness is being
threatened," he says.
   The conservation groups that often sponsor his concerts
say Walkin' Jim is a persuasive missionary for wilderness
preservation. "Unless you're a Martin Luther King-type
orator, somebody like Walkin' Jim, who mixes songs with
photographs, is the best way to reach people," says Mike
Bader, the executive director of the Alliance for the Wild
Rockies, a Missoula, Mont., group that's leading a drive to
expand wilderness areas.
   Mr. Stoltz concedes that his passion for solitary
wilderness walking is somewhat "wacko." Perhaps it's a
reaction to growing up in Detroit, where he was a shy,
reclusive teen-ager. "I was a city boy. The last thing you
think of as a Detroiter is to be so close to the earth," he
says. A Boy Scout leader "inspired in me a love for music" --
and of hiking, he says.
   In 1973, while hiking in Virginia, Mr. Stoltz met a man
who was walking the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia
to Maine. "I was captivated by the romance of it," Mr. Stoltz
says. The next year, he trekked the trail. When the 28-week
walk ended on the peak of Maine's Mt. Katahdin in mid-October
of 1974, he decided to walk West.
   He started from West Quoddy Head, Maine, the easternmost
tip of the U.S., and finished -- 4,811 miles and a year and a
half later -- at Cape Alava, Wash., the westernmost point in
the lower 48 states. For three months he hiked on snowshoes.
He fell through the ice trying to cross a river. He was
almost hit by a train while walking along the tracks in a
blizzard.
   Frightening to some, perhaps, but less so to Walkin' Jim.
To him, back woods and mountains are home, and fending for
himself gives him a sense of confidence. Of his first major
hike, he says, "I discovered a real peace out there. I felt
like I was coming home."
   In the hiking hierarchy, Mr. Stoltz is at the pinnacle: a
wilderness walker. "Most people who do it, do it on roads. I
did it all back country," he says. He's never taken a ride,
even when he ran out of water halfway across a 60-mile desert
in Idaho and was found, sick and trembling, by a woman in a
truck. He accepted water and fruit juices from her, but not a
lift. It's a point of pride.
   In 1979, Mr. Stoltz walked the Continental Divide, from
the Mexican to the Canadian borders, composing songs along
the way. "I wrote a song about every 100 miles, and since it
was a 2,700-mile trip, it was pretty productive," he says.
   Mr. Stoltz, who has recorded three albums, sings in a deep
bass that sounds like a distant rapid in a canyon stream. His
songs are paeans to nature, like "Listen to the Earth," or
ballads. "The Ballad of Willie and Millie" tells of romance
and destruction in Butte, Mont. "Listen to the Wind" recounts
the life of Jim Bridger, the 19th-century explorer and
mountain man. "I'm Going Back to Idaho" was written on his
third walk across that state.
   In the winter, Mr. Stoltz sings at Lone Mountain Ranch, a
Big Sky mecca for cross-country skiers where his wife,
Leslie, is a guide. He tours in the spring and fall,
appearing in schools and concert halls at fees ranging from
$300 to $2,000.
   At his concerts, he promotes his causes. One is to win
wilderness classification of 17 million acres of roadless
Forest Service lands, primarily in Idaho and Montana. It's a
controversial issue here.
   "The polarization in the Northwest between the logging
industry and the people who want to preserve the environment
is really incredible," he says. The fight has been
particularly bitter since 1988, when President Reagan vetoed
a bill that would have added 1.5 million acres to Montana's
protected wilderness areas.
   While he concedes he's no politician, he follows
wilderness legislation carefully and asks his audiences to
sign petitions promoting the protection of wild lands. "I
hate even thinking about this, but I can't help it," he says.
"My vision of the wilderness, the things I sing about, the
slides I show, are all things that are in danger."
   Not everybody likes the message. As Bruce Vincent, the
business manager of Vincent Logging Inc. in Libby, Mont.,
sees it, "A bunch of ardent preservation groups are pushing
to have a ludicrous amount of public land" set aside as
wilderness. "It's not responsible environmentalism to exclude
man" from the woods by setting aside vast tracts that only
the hardiest hikers can use, he argues.
   Walkin' Jim couldn't disagree more. To him, the wilderness
is a "place where everything works like it's supposed to
work, and it doesn't need any help from humans." On his
walks, he averages 12 to 14 miles a day, often going weeks
without seeing another person. The most he has ever walked in
one day is 32 miles. "I was feeling strong," he says.
   Mr. Stoltz packs all his food for the trip before he
leaves so his wife can mail it to him along the way. Usually
he carries a 60-pound pack with a two-week supply of food --
granola and dried fruit for breakfast, trail mix and candy
bars for snacks throughout the day and pasta or rice with
vegetables for dinner. He plans his routes meticulously to
take him close to water and to towns where he can pick up
supplies and indulge his passion for ice cream.
   After their marriage two years ago, he and Leslie took a
23-day honeymoon hike through the Grand Canyon. "I love
hiking with my wife, but I've found that I also need time
alone with the wilderness," he says, because "the solitude
and closeness with the earth is much more intense."
   But long walks aren't as free as they used to be. As his
concert career expands, he is obliged to answer more
correspondence, be more businesslike. Says Walkin' Jim: "I
consider myself a success in a lot of ways, but the more
successful I am, the harder it is to get away on walks."
