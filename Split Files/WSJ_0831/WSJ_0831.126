   A federal appeals court overturned a $5.2 million damages
award to entertainer Wayne Newton in his long-running libel
suit against General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co.
unit.
   The suit is one of a growing number of cases in which
public figures sue on grounds that an article or broadcast
created a false impression, even if each statement taken
separately was true. In a ruling yesterday, the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco found that most of the
factual statements in the broadcast were undisputed and that
any false impressions had not been shown to be deliberate or
reckless.

   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public figures can't
win a libel case unless they prove that a statement was
false, defamatory and published with knowledge of its falsity
or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.
But Mr. Newton had alleged that he had been defamed by
implication and that the reporters must take responsibility
for the impressions they intentionally conveyed.
   The suit arose out of an Oct. 6, 1980, segment on NBC's
evening news titled "Wayne Newton and the Law." Mr. Newton
argued that the NBC report created the impression that he had
received financial assistance from organized-crime figures to
finance the purchase of a hotel. Among other things, he cited
the reporters' failure to include in the broadcast the fact
that he received a bank loan to finance the purchase.
   In December 1986, a jury in a Las Vegas, Nev., federal
district court found that the broadcast had created a false
impression and awarded Mr. Newton $19.2 million in damages.
Judge Myron Crocker, who heard the case, reduced the award to
$5.2 million, setting aside the jury's award for loss of
income and reducing an award for injury to reputation to
$50,000 from $5 million.
   "Wayne Newton's case poses the danger that First Amendment
values will be subverted by a local jury biased in favor of a
prominent local public figure against an alien speaker who
criticizes that local hero," the appeals court wrote.
   The appeals panel said that NBC could not be held liable
even if the broadcast created a false impression as Mr.
Newton alleged. The panel said the lower court improperly
considered its own view of the supposed false impression
instead of the intentions of the journalists who prepared the
broadcast. Such an approach, the panel wrote, "would permit
liability to be imposed not only for what was not said but
also for what was not intended to be said."
   The panel did not rule on whether the broadcast as a whole
was false. Instead, it based the ruling on the fact that Mr.
Newton had failed to show sufficient evidence that the
reporters deliberately lied or had been reckless with the
truth.
   Morton Galane, the Reno, Nev., lawyer who represented Mr.
Newton, said he could not comment because he was unable to
reach his client.
   "This is a case that never should have been brought or
gone to a jury in the first place. But the decision reaffirms
the willingness of the courts to afford protection in the
libel area when the jury system goes haywire," said Floyd
Abrams of the New York firm Cahill, Gordon &amp; Reindel, a
lawyer for NBC.

   RACKETEERING CHARGES FILED against Asian fraternal
organization.
   A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted the On Leong
Chinese Merchants Association, and chapters of the nationwide
organization in three U.S. cities, on racketeering, gambling
and tax-fraud charges.
   The 34-count indictment -- which followed a 30-month
investigation -- alleges the operation of what prosecutors
call a "nationwide illegal gambling business." On Leong
chapters in Chicago, Houston, and New York were also accused
in the indictment of operating "casino-style" centers
featuring games of chance such as pai gow and fan-tan. Also
named as defendants were 29 officials and members of the
so-called tong, or association.
   Under racketeering law, prosecutors are seeking forfeiture
of certain On Leong properties, including the national
headquarters in New York, as well as about $11.5 million in
proceeds from the alleged gambling operation.
   On Leong officials couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.
   The indictment leans heavily on telephone conversations at
the Chicago chapter, which federal agents raided and closed
down in 1988.
   The indictment also cites conversations between the
defendants and Simon Au Yeung, an informant hired by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation to penetrate illegal Asian
organizations in the U.S. Mr. Au Yeung played a role in the
FBI's 1988 investigation.
   More recently he worked undercover to assist federal and
New York authorities in seizing 850 pounds of Southeast Asian
heroin allegedly imported by a different Chinese group.

   DECISION BARRING REPORTERS from taking notes during trial
is appealed.
   Attorneys for the Philadelphia Daily News are appealing a
judge's order prohibiting a reporter from taking notes during
a first-degree murder trial.
   The order, handed down by Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge
Edward J. Maier, is thought to be unprecedented. Judge Maier
ruled at a hearing in his chambers that he had a "gut
feeling" against allowing reporters to take notes, according
to a court transcript.
   The judge said the notes could be used to challenge the
official court record and that the taking of notes could
distract jurors.
   "It might cause the jury to give greater attention to some
testimony rather than other testimony," Judge Maier ruled.
   The ruling came after Daily News reporter Joseph P. Blake
was told by a court bailiff to stop taking notes on Aug. 20.
The judge noted that few reporters ever cover trials in his
court but that he has nonetheless forbidden note-taking for
10 years. Allowing reporters to take notes, he said, could
lead to allowing tape recorders and cameras.
   Courts have generally been protective of the right of
spectators to take notes and sketch pictures during trials,
particularly news gatherers, said Katherine Hatton, of the
Philadelphia law firm Kohn, Savett, Klein &amp; Graf, which
represents the Daily News, published by Philadelphia
Newspapers Inc., a unit of Knight-Ridder Inc. of Miami.
   In 1980 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that reporters at
trials function as "surrogates for the public," and therefore
can be entitled under the First Amendment to special seating
and priority entry, Ms. Hatton wrote in her appeal to the
Pennsylvania Superior Court.
   The issue of whether reporters can be barred from taking
notes, however, has never come up in a court case, Ms. Hatton
said.

   SUPERFUND ENFORCEMENT CHIEF is to join law firm.
   Lloyd Guerci will leave the Environmental Protection
Agency next week to become a partner in the Washington office
of the Chicago law firm Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt. Mr. Guerci, who
as a career civil servant has extensive experience in toxic
and hazardous waste regulation, said he chose Mayer Brown
because of its environmental practice, which he hopes to
expand.
   Mr. Guerci said that his work at the 45-lawyer Washington
office will include representing businesses before the EPA on
pollution-enforcement matters. Currently, federal law permits
an official to lobby his former agency immediately after his
departure provided the lobbying does not involve matters in
which he was personally and substantially involved, and
provided the official's staff was not involved in the matter
during his last year on the job.
   Tougher restrictions go into effect Jan. 1.
