   LOS ANGELES -- Three shareholders have filed a derivative
action on behalf of Allergan Inc. against 11 Allergan
officers and directors and former parent SmithKline Beecham
PLC.
   The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims
Allergan could lose millions of dollars as a result of
several stockholder class actions. These actions were filed
against Allergan after its stock price dropped last September
in the wake of an announcement that sales would not grow as
previously expected.

   The plaintiffs charge that Allergan management and
SmithKline failed to disclose in a 1989 prospectus issued
when Allergan was spun off by SmithKline that its financial
performance was dependent on the success of new "Retinal
Analyzer" technology and on the number of "newly fit"
contact-lens wearers.
   Allergan and SmithKline declined to comment on the suit.
The complaint asks the individual defendants to repay their
salaries and other compensation to Allergan. It also seeks
unspecified damages from SmithKline to be paid to Allergan
along with attorney fees and costs.
   The shareholder plaintiffs include Peter Stuyvesant Ltd.,
Joanne Gollomp and Eisenberg Sales Inc.
