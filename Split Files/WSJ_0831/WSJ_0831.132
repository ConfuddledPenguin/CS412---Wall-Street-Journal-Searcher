   Fibreboard Corp. said that a Texas court has issued a
ruling that will allow the company, a maker of various
building materials, to pursue an appeal of claims against it
in 175 asbestos-related lawsuits.
   Under the ruling, Concord, Calif.-based Fibreboard
estimates it will have to post a bond of $3 million to mount
its appeal to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Prior
to the ruling, the company feared the lower court would ask
for "an excessive amount" of money to be posted as bond,
making it impossible for Fibreboard to pursue an appeal, a
spokesman said.

   The ruling was issued by Judge Robert Parker of the U.S.
District Court, East District of Texas in Beaumont.
Fibreboard said it thinks it will be several months before it
appeals the judgments in the asbestos-related lawsuits, since
many of the cases are still pending.
