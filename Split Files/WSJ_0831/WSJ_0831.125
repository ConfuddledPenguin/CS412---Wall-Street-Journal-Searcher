   BRASILIA (AP) -- Brazil's central bank president said the
country won't make any payments this year on overdue interest
owed on its $114 billion foreign debt, the largest in the
developing world.
   "The only gesture we are disposed to make is to negotiate
realistically with our creditors," Ibrahim Eris said in an
interview with foreign reporters.

   Brazil, which some analysts say has had an undeclared
moratorium on debt payments for more than a year, is late on
payments of $6 billion to private banks and $2 billion to the
so-called Paris Club, the 10 industrialized countries with
the greatest influence in the International Monetary Fund.
   It wasn't clear whether Brazil's move might be matched by
other countries in Latin America, which has a combined
foreign debt of $434.6 billion, according to a study by Latin
American Economic System, Caracas, Venezuela.
   Latin American economic ministers are to meet in Caracas
next week, and the worsening debt problem will be among the
issues discussed. They have complained that debt-relief
programs such as the one created by U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady are insufficient.
   Other countries overdue on interest payments include
Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, the Dominican
Republic, Bolivia and Paraguay.
