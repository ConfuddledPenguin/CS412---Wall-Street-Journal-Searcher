   "If God had meant us to build fibreglass boats, he would
have grown fibreglass trees."

   WARREN, R.I. -- Can a product be too durable?
   Ask veteran boat-builder Everett Pearson. In 1959, he
built a 30-foot sailboat out of a then revolutionary material
called fiberglass. He called the boat the Triton, and
eventually sold 1,100 of them. They're nearly all still
afloat. So are thousands of other sailing yachts that Mr.
Pearson has launched in a 30-year boat-building career,
including about 8,000 yachts built by Tillotson-Pearson Inc.,
the Rhode Island boat manufacturing company that Mr. Pearson
started in 1976.
   Fiberglass was once hailed as a wonder material for yacht
hulls because of its light weight, ease of upkeep and cost
savings in mass production. Most boat owners still love this
reinforced plastic-wooden boats comprise only a small amount
of new-boat construction -- but the material's best qualities
have become a nightmare for sailboat builders.
   Unlike wood, which needs regular upkeep to keep the rot
away, fiberglass doesn't deteriorate. "God didn't invent a
fiberglass-eating termite," says Stephen Cutsforth, national
sales and marketing director for Hunter Marine Corp.,
Alachua, Fla.
   The growth in sailboat sales has slowed in recent years.
Analysts blame economic uncertainty, the high costs of marina
space and a failure to sell the sport to a wider audience.
The result is a market saturated with 30 years worth of used
fiberglass sailboats. Dealers find it excruciatingly tough to
push new boats on customers when their yards and piers are
filled with fully equipped used boats that perform nearly as
well as new boats and sell for a fraction of new-boat prices.
   Yacht builders, most of them small concerns, have been
clobbered. Companies and designs familiar to sailors
world-wide -- O'Day, San Juan, Columbia, Nonesuch, Laser,
Ericson, Irwin, Olson -- have merged, reorganized, licensed
their designs to other builders, or shut down completely.
   The sailing yacht industry, which used to be spread among
dozens of small yards, is increasingly dominated by a handful
of high-volume companies such as Hunter Marine, and the
French-owned boatbuilder Chantiers Beneteau.
   Small yards that produce luxury, custom-built boats say
business is still buoyant. "A year ago we had 18 employees.
Now we have 75," says Ned Goodhue, president of Able Marine
Inc., Trenton, Maine. "We build six boats a year that sell
from $400,000 to $3 million apiece and we're happy as a clam
at high tide."
   But these are exceptions in a glum business. "The Nordic
44 . . . still sells eight years after its introduction,"
gushed Yachting magazine, in a 1988 review. No more. "We have
just delivered our last sailboat order," says Steve Nordvedt,
president of Nordic Yachts, Inc., Ferndale, Wash. Since 1977,
Nordic built 180 sailboats from 37 feet to 45 feet in length.
The company is now building large powerboats.
   Tillotson-Pearson is feeling the pinch. Its J/24 class, a
24-foot fiberglass racing-cruising sloop, is one of the
world's most popular medium-sized yachts. Tillotson-Pearson
has built about 4,000 J/24s. But for all the boat's
continuing popularity, the existing supply is so large that
only about 30 new J/24s will be built this year, Mr. Pearson
says.
   In the past 18 months, Tillotson-Pearson has laid off 200
employees from its production site near Narragansett Bay.
That's about 40% of its work force. Mr. Pearson projects
total 1990 sales of $26 million, down from $36 million two
years ago. About 70% of the company's revenue comes from
yacht sales.
   These days, Mr. Pearson is working hard to turn his
fiberglass expertise into new products. Tillotson-Pearson has
built 15,000 giant fiberglass blades for energy-producing
windmills. It has started producing small fiberglass pools
where swimmers can stroke in place against a current produced
by a hidden paddle wheel. The New England Patriots and Denver
Broncos football teams each bought one for their training
rooms.
   And with an eye to the nation's aging infrastructure, Mr.
Pearson is trying to convince highway authorities that they
should consider fiberglass modules as an inexpensive means of
replacing thousands of deteriorating bridges on rural roads.
   But Mr. Pearson's most intriguing fiberglass gambit is
taking shape on a section of Tillotson-Pearson's yacht
assembly line, where workers are laboring on a half-completed
sailboat hull that looks something like a bullet-shaped water
bug.
   It's a radically-designed, 32-foot yacht, dubbed the Manta
32. Its co-designer, Garry Hoyt, says Manta is designed to
sail at 15 knots in a brisk wind, unusually fast for a
cruising sailboat, and travel at 15 knots anytime under
power.
   The boat's expected speed comes from several innovations:
an airfoil-shaped mast that reduces wind resistance; an
elliptical-shaped mainsail that's bigger and more efficient
than a conventional triangle-shaped mainsail; and a system of
movable water ballast that keeps the boat from heeling, or
tipping, excessively. Heeling can be uncomfortable and tends
to reduce a boat's speed.
   As Mr. Hoyt and Mr. Pearson see it, the design addresses
another obstacle to the growth of the sailing-yacht industry.
Manta has a noticeable lack of lines, blocks and other gear
that dyed-in-the-wool sailors love and yachting beginners
find puzzling. Indeed, Manta looks a lot like a power boat.
That's fine with Mr. Hoyt, a maverick in the yachting
community, who thinks tradition-bound yachtsmen who dismiss
powerboat owners as "stinkpotters" or worse have only
themselves to blame for the sales slump.
   "The sailboat business suffers from design constipation,"
says the sharp-tongued Mr. Hoyt, who was a U.S. Olympic team
sailor and a senior executive at advertising agency Young &amp;
Rubicam before turning to yacht consulting. He thinks the
all-but-indestructible fiberglass boat is only one reason
that sailboats account for less than 5% of total new-boat
sales.
   Yachting, according to Mr. Hoyt, has crafted an image of a
sport that is expensive to get into, difficult to learn,
potentially dangerous, and peopled with arrogant characters
such as America's Cup skippers who are either arguing on the
water or arguing in court. Unlike fast-growing sports like
golf and skiing, yachting is boring to watch on television,
Mr. Hoyt says. What's more, he adds, women as a consumer
class find sailboats uncomfortable and are turned off by the
loutish behavior of racing sailors.
   "No sport can aspire to serious size by writing off 50% of
the population," Mr. Hoyt told an industry conference in
Miami last February in a 30-minute speech laced with sarcasm.
"For sailing to have managed sales shrinkage during a time of
extraordinary boating growth bespeaks a rare kind of sales
genius on our part."
   Mr. Goodhue of Able Marine bristles at Mr. Hoyt's
indictment. "Garry Hoyt is viewed as a self-serving nut," he
says.
   But Mr. Hoyt says builders that scoffed at his ideas a few
years ago are beginning to listen now that sales are soft. "I
think he's accurate that the sport has been aloof," says
Hunter Marine's Mr. Cutsforth.
   Mr. Pearson is showing his confidence in the Manta with an
upfront manufacturing investment of close to $500,000. "I've
looked at a lot of Garry's ideas and not agreed with them,
but my gut tells me this boat is right," Mr. Pearson says.
"Not to take the risk," he adds, "is to sit on our hands and
go down the drain with everybody else."
   The Manta 32 is scheduled for launch in mid-September. If
the boat performs as predicted on Narragansett Bay, it will
debut at the huge Annapolis, Md., sailboat show in early
October.
   Says Mr. Hoyt with a confident grin: "I'm either going to
look very smart or very stupid."
