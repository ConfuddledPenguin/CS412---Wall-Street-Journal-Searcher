   NEW YORK -- Sutton Holding Corp. said certain of its
shareholders are interested in acquiring DeSoto Inc.'s
detergents business by acquiring all of the remaining equity
in the company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Sutton said the proposed acquisition would occur following
consummation of DeSoto's pending sale transactions.

   DeSoto is in the midst of completing a number of
agreements that will represent a liquidation of nearly all
the company's assets with the exception of its detergents
business. New York-based Sutton Holdings earlier sought to
acquire all of DeSoto, but terminated its $50-per-share bid
last month.
   In the SEC filing, Sutton said the proposed acquisition
would be subject to various conditions, including financing
and completion of a satisfactory legal and business review of
the company.
   A spokesman for DeSoto, a Des Plaines, Ill., maker of
paints, chemicals and detergents, hadn't any comment on the
filing.
   Separately, DeSoto said the Federal Trade Commission has
requested additional information on the planned sale of its
surfactants and emulsifier business to Witco Corp., New York.
In addition to that planned sale, DeSoto also agreed to sell
its industrial coatings business to Courtlands PLC of London.
   The company said it plans to comply with the FTC request
as "promptly as possible."
