   NEW YORK -- Federated Stores Inc. said the Internal
Revenue Service has filed tax claims of $586.8 million,
exclusive of interest, against its Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. retailing units.
   An IRS official couldn't be reached for comment, but a
Federated Stores spokeswoman said the filings were made in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Cincinnati and had been expected.
Interest on the $586.8 million in question is $125 million,
but that sum is expected to be reduced as the IRS claims are
negotiated.

   According to a statement issued by Federated Stores, the
IRS is questioning deductions related to the takeover of
Allied and Federated by Toronto-based Campeau Corp., the
parent company of Federated Stores; deferral of taxes on
properties sold after those units were acquired; and other
issues unrelated to the acquisitions.
   A spokeswoman for Federated Stores said the company is
disputing the IRS claims. She noted that Federated Stores
believes most, if not all, of the claims can be resolved
without bankruptcy-court intervention by year end.
   Separately, National Bank of Canada has decided to write
off the remainder of the personal debt owed it by developer
Robert Campeau. The amount involved, $80 million Canadian
dollars (US$70.1 million), was borrowed by Mr. Campeau to buy
securities in Campeau Corp. Originally Mr. Campeau had
borrowed approximately C$156 million from National Bank. The
bank previously wrote off about C$76 million of that debt.
   Earlier this month, Mr. Campeau lost his position as
chairman and chief executive officer of the company that
bears his name.
   National Bank said it will take the write-offs in two
equal amounts in its fiscal third and fourth quarters, and
noted that the write-offs were largely responsible for a
sharp profit decline in the third quarter ended July 31.
   Earnings for the quarter fell to C$22 million, or 10
Canadian cents a share, from C$65.5 million, or 50 Canadian
cents a share, a year earlier. In heavy trading on the
Montreal Exchange yesterday, National Bank stock closed at
C$8.75, down 37.5 Canadian cents.
   National Bank said it took the write-offs after Mr.
Campeau "wasn't able" to buy back the Campeau Corp.
securities that the bank had seized from Mr. Campeau in
January.
   Mr. Campeau and his lawyer couldn't be reached for
comment. A spokesman for Campeau Corp. said the Toronto real
estate and retailing concern doesn't comment on Mr. Campeau's
personal affairs.
   The failure of Mr. Campeau to buy back the securities
means National Bank now owns a 38% stake in Campeau Corp. on
a fully diluted basis. The other major holder is
Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which owns
38.6% on a fully diluted basis.
