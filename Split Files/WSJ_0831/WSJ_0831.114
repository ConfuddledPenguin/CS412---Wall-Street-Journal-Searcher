   British Coal Corp., the state-owned national coal mining
concern, reported that operating profit for the year ended
March 31 plunged 73%. It cited geological problems, tough
competition and a third consecutive mild British winter.
   Operating profit, or profit before interest charges and
exceptional items, fell to #133 million ($258.7 million) from
#498 million a year earlier. The overall loss, after special
items, plummeted to #5.08 billion from #203 million, as the
British government moved to write off British Coal's past
losses as part of changes in the company's financial
structure.

   British Coal had #4.64 billion of special items, including
#4.16 billion for the asset write-offs and provisions against
pensioners' concessionary coal charges. Year-earlier results
included a #269 million charge related to the cost of
restructuring. Interest charges jumped 33% to #574 million
from #432 million.
