   TOKYO -- Canon Inc., a major Japanese maker of cameras and
business machines, said that its consolidated pretax earnings
in the first half of the year surged 55% to 64.17 billion yen
($446.8 million) from 41.29 billion yen a year earlier,
because of brisk demand.
   Net income in the six months ended June 30 jumped 55% to
25.61 billion yen, or 32.55 yen a share, from 16.54 billion
yen, or 22.17 yen a share.

   Sales amounted to 832.82 billion yen, showing a 33% gain
from 627.7 billion yen.
   Encouraged by the brisk results, Canon said it has revised
its 1990 earnings projections upward. It now sees pretax
earnings at about 140 billon yen, sharply higher than an
initial estimate of 105 billion yen made in February. Net is
estimated at 55 billion yen, up from an original 43 billion
yen projection. Canon expects 1990 sales to total some 1.7
trillion yen, rising from 1.5 trillion yen.
   Canon officials said the company has decided to revise the
projections in light of stronger-than-expected demand.
   In the first half, they said, demand was brisk for such
products as copiers, laser beam printers and other computer
peripherals, as well as facsimile machines.
   Sales in the business machines division climbed 31% to
665.58 billion yen, accounting for as much as 80% of the
company's entire business.
   Camera sales came to 114.43 billion yen, up 52% from a
year earlier. Single-lens reflex cameras, as well as 8mm
video equipment, helped sustain sales, Canon officials said.
   Sales of optical machines and other related products rose
18% to 52.81 billion yen. Equipment for the production of
semiconductors was among the products that officials said
contributed to the healthy gain.
   During the six months, Canon did 71% of its business
overseas, with sales totaling 591.38 billion yen. They
represented a 38% year-to-year surge.
   Domestic sales climbed 21% to 241.45 billion yen.
