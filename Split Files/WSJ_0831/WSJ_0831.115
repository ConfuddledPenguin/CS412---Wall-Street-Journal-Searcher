   Alco Standard Corp., Valley Forge, Pa., said it decided to
sell the companies in its Alco Food Systems group because
they appear to lack "the inherent capacity" to achieve
long-term growth goals.
   The distribution and services concern said that no sales
transactions are pending and that it doesn't know how much
the units might bring.

   The company didn't indicate how much the units contribute
to annual sales and profit, but it described them as
"collectively profitable."
   Separately, Alco Standard said it expects to establish a
reserve of about $8 million, or 13 cents a share, in its
fourth quarter, related to a judgment entered recently in
litigation. It didn't elaborate. The company expressed
confidence in having "excellent grounds to prevail on
appeal," but said it believes the reserve is an appropriate
precaution.
   For the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, 1989, the company
reported net income of $33.8 million, or 81 cents a share, on
revenue of $1.08 billion.
