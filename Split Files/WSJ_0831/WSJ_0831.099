   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department said it began a major
program to reduce injuries to the arm and wrist and other
disorders common to repeated-motion jobs.
   As a first step, the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration issued guidelines for preventing such
ailments in the meatpacking industry. OSHA will seek
agreements with 16 large packers with more than 1,000 workers
each to carry out those guidelines. The agency will conduct
special inspections of large plants if the companies refuse
to sign such pacts. Inspections would begin in January.

   Afterward, similar agreements may be sought with 20
packing companies that have 500 to 1,000 workers each, with
inspections planned for non-signers. The inspections could
lead to OSHA citations for violating health standards.
   In addition, the agency said it will soon begin
rule-making proceedings aimed at upgrading rules on
repetitive-motion injuries in a wide range of industries. It
would take several years to develop such standards, Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole said.
   She said the meat industry, which employs 140,000 workers,
will get first attention because its rates of "ergonomic
illnesses" are at least 10 times those of the general
population. As new meatpacking technology puts more emphasis
on repeated-motion tasks under stressful conditions, "the
problem has been getting worse," Mrs. Dole said.
   Ergonomics involves adapting the workplace environment to
the needs of workers, rather than trying to make workers
adjust to the workplace. Occupational health experts have
been finding increased ergonomic hazards in recent years in
such industries as meatpacking, auto production and
communications. They can cause disorders such as carpal
tunnel syndrome, a crippling condition that often afflicts
the hands, wrists or arms of meatpacking or other workers.
OSHA said that 48% of workplace health disorders involve
repetitive motion.
   The guideline techniques were developed recently by
ergonomists. They include detailed suggestions for analyzing
repeated-motion hazards; taking engineering or other steps to
reduce or eliminate them; monitoring the health of workers,
removing them from the hazardous work and providing timely
treatment; and training managers and workers to avoid the
ergonomic problems.
   The United Food and Commercial Workers union, whose
members work on meatpacking lines, praised the guidelines.
But Allen Zack, a union spokesman, faulted the plan for
continuing to rely on company records to measure how well a
plant is eliminating repeated-motion hazards.
   "We should have learned our lesson by now," Mr. Zack said,
noting criticism of meatpackers by some members of Congress
as well as OSHA enforcement actions, both dealing largely
with inadequate recordkeeping.
   Mr. Zack also complained that packers would be able to
avoid inspections by signing agreements with OSHA that won't
be subject to close monitoring by the union. By contrast, he
cited a 1988 ergonomics agreement that involved the food
workers union as well as OSHA and IBP Inc., a big meatpacker
in Nebraska. OSHA has signed some other agreements with
meatpacking and auto companies since then.
   The guidelines were praised by J. Patrick Boyle, president
of the American Meat Institute, as using many recommendations
made by the trade group's safety committee. "Flexibility is
the key to these guidelines. Because they are not rules or
standards, plant management can pick and choose as they
tailor ergonomic programs to their individual needs," while
also "exploring new ways to protect their workers," he said.
