   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. again lowered
ratings on about $1 billion of Charter Medical Corp.'s
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
   The ratings firm, which had downgraded Charter's debt in
early July, said the action reflects concerns about the
company's ability to service its debt because of
deteriorating earnings and cash flow.

   Charter had a loss of $40.6 million on revenue of $315.2
million in its third quarter ended June 30. That compared
with a loss of $5.1 million on revenue of $308 million in the
year-earlier period.
   Charter, based in Macon, Ga., is one of the largest
psychiatric hospital operators in the U.S. and also operates
13 general hospitals. In the face of a tightening market for
psychiatric care, it has been struggling this year under $1.6
billion in debt from the 1988 management-led buy-out of the
company.
   Moody's reduced Charter's senior debt ratings to Caa from
single-B-2. It also downgraded the company's senior
subordinated debt to Ca from single-B-3 and its other
subordinated debt to Ca from Caa. The rating of Charter's
preferred stock remains unchanged at Ca, Moody's said.
   Moody's said the wider third-quarter loss stems from
declining occupancy rates in Charter's hospitals, a drop-off
that exceeds the industry average and that "may well extend
into the coming year."
   J. Rodney Laughlin, executive vice president of human
resources and development at Charter, acknowledged that the
company has been faring worse than other psychiatric chains,
citing widespread publicity about the company's financial
problems as the source of the trouble. But he added that
cost-cutting measures, as well as a plan to sell and lease
back 12 hospitals, should enable Charter to "bounce back
quickly."
   "We are current with all of our debt obligations," Mr.
Laughlin said, "and we expect to remain so."
