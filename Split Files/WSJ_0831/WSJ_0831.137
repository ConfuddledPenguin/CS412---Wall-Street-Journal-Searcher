   ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Comshare Inc. President Richard L.
Crandall said the computer software company "expects to make
more acquisitions" in its current fiscal year and is "looking
beyond North America" to continue expanding its product
lines.
   "In addition to internal growth, we intend to do some
acquisitions, although they are likely to focus along product
lines that relate to products we already have," Mr. Crandall
said. "However, it's likely that acquisitions we would make
outside the U.S. will be in territories where we presently
have a direct sales force."

   Comshare has operations in the United Kingdom, Germany,
France and Australia, he said. Mr. Crandall said the company
also will look at developing more "strategic alliances" with
other companies.
   Comshare declined to forecast earnings for its first
quarter, ending Sept. 30. Jackson Spears, an analyst at
Chicago Corp., estimates first-quarter earnings at 22 cents a
share and earnings for the year at $1.65 a share.
   In the year-earlier first quarter, Comshare reported net
income of $1.12 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue of
$22.1 million.
   For the year ended June 30, Comshare reported net of $6.9
million, or $1.25 a share, on revenue of $104 million. The
fiscal 1990 results were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock
split in May.
   About 50% of Comshare's revenue is generated from markets
outside North America, the company said. Its primary business
is developing and marketing executive information systems and
financial consolidation systems for business managers.
   T. Wallace Wrathall, Comshare's chief financial officer,
said the company has increased its sales force by 20% in the
past five months in preparation for a product introduction
next month and as part of a sales expansion in Europe and
Australia.
