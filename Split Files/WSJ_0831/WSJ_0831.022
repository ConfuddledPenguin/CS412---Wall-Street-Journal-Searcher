   NEW YORK -- Two media barons who had targeted the nation's
beauty salons as avenues for introducing new media properties
are headed in different directions.
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it has scrapped its
heavily publicized plan to create a commercially sponsored
video network for beauty salons. The plan, the Salon Network,
was announced in February, but it was shelved because of weak
response from key advertisers.

   Whittle Communications L.P., however, said it will unveil
next week a revamped magazine for the nation's beauty salons.
Called American Style, the slick magazine takes the place of
Southern Style, an oversized magazine that had been
distributed free of charge in salons in southern states.
Southern Style was discontinued last year after its sole
sponsor, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., pulled out. Procter &amp; Gamble,
however, is one of several advertisers in the new American
Style.
   Both projects are part of a wave of new media properties
that attempt to go beyond TV, newspapers and magazines in
targeting audiences in supermarkets, doctors' offices and at
sporting events.
   Copies of American Style will be sent next week to 140,000
beauty salons. Craige Johnson, American Style publisher, said
25% of women visiting the salons are expected to read a copy
of the magazine, which will be published every two months.
