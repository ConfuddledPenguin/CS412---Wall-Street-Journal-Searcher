   Nintendo isn't just for boys anymore.
   In a bid to hang on to its staggering 80% share of the
$3.5 billion video-game business, Nintendo of America on
Monday will begin airing a new ad campaign targeting men aged
18 to 49. The effort marks an unusual switch for the Redmond,
Wash., company, where previous marketing efforts have almost
exclusively targeted the young boys who make up the core of
its franchise.

   The new campaign is the first for Nintendo by Foote, Cone
&amp; Belding's San Francisco office, the shop Nintendo tapped in
June to replace McCann-Erickson on its $35 million account.
But it comes as some industry experts say the video-game
market is nearing saturation. At the same time, two new
players in the category, NEC Corp. and Sega of America, are
stepping up their own ad programs to gain a foothold in the
video-game market.
   One new Nintendo spot features three career guys --
including a suited CEO-type -- playing Nintendo's Game Boy
handheld unit at the office. "You don't stop playing because
you get old," an announcer says. "But you could get old if
you stop playing." The campaign will run on the Fox network
in prime time.
   "Our focus now is that this product is completely
appropriate for adults," says Donald Coyner, advertising
manager at Nintendo, a unit of Nintendo of Japan. "We're just
suggesting that they, too, have permission to have some fun.
We want them to take a break and enjoy themselves."
   Mr. Coyner insists the decision to run ads targeting men
isn't a reaction to a saturated market or to the aggressive
moves by its competitors. He says the campaign grew out of
research showing that 40% of Game Boy purchasers are over the
age of 18, with strong potential for further growth.
   Nor is the campaign a response to flagging Nintendo sales.
The company this year estimates it will sell more than nine
million video-game systems, about even with last year's
sales. But this year, it also estimates it will sell about
five million units of Game Boy, which was introduced last
August.
   Nintendo's appeal to adults doesn't mean that it is
abandoning kids. Included in the new effort are some hip,
MTV-style ads aimed squarely at youngsters. One ad mixes
black-and-white and color footage showing kids playing
Nintendo at the basketball court. At the end of the spot, an
animated purple dog jumps toward the camera. "Nintendo . . .
word]" a kid yells. According to Nintendo, "word" is kid for
"great."
   "In talking to kids, we know that Game Boy is on many wish
lists, but it might be No. 3," says Mr. Coyner. "We're trying
to establish that game as the cool product. We want to
heighten the excitement so it moves to the top of the wish
list."
   Tim Price, group creative director at Foote Cone, says the
agency tried to develop ads that would speak to kids in their
own language. "Most video-game advertising looks the same and
sort of dated. They show two kids, playing the game, bouncing
up and down and looking phony," he says. "These ads should
kind of look like kids made them. We tried not to make them
look too slick. If it's kind of clunky in one place, that's
OK."
   Mr. Coyner credits McCann-Erickson with helping Nintendo
raise awareness of its products. But he says the McCann ads
"were fairly literal" and the Foote Cone work will have a
contemporary feel that is critical to winning the attention
of kids and adults. "Everything that speaks to the consumer
-- the advertising, our packaging -- must convey a
`leading-edge' kind of attitude," he says.
   Mr. Price and Mr. Coyner say they know they face a
challenge in getting men to think of Nintendo as more than a
kids' toy. But they say once they succeed in getting the idea
in front of a man, they have a shot at winning him over.
   Mr. Price says, for example, two Foote Cone account
executives playing Game Boy aboard a plane recently were
stopped by a middle-aged businessman who asked what they were
doing. The ad executives invited him to join along, but he
deferred, saying, "I can't do that, I'm a vice president."
"We're vice presidents," the two Foote Cone staffers said,
and convinced him to give it a try.

   Chiat Wins Canadian Air
                                                                                                       

   Canadian Airlines yesterday awarded its account for
English-language ads to Chiat/Day/Mojo's Toronto office.
   The account will bill 20 million to 25 million Canadian
dollars (US$17.5 million to US$21.9 million).
   Ira Matathia, president and chief executive of Chiat's
Canadian operations, said yesterday the account will be among
the shop's two largest clients. BCP, a French-language shop,
continues to handle that part of the business.
   Mr. Matathia said he plans to announce "within the next
week or so" the name of a new creative director for the
office.
