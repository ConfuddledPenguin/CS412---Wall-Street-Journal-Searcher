   WASHINGTON -- Factory orders rebounded in July, nearly
making up for June's decline, the Commerce Department
reported.
   Orders for manufactured goods ranging from chemicals to
airplanes grew 1.6% during the month, after falling 1.9% the
previous month, the department said. Aircraft orders were
particularly strong. But orders fell for motor vehicles,
another important U.S. manufacturing industry.

   Since the beginning of the year, factory orders frequently
have risen one month only to decline the next. Economists
view the choppy pattern as an indication of softness and
uncertainty in the manufacturing sector.
   U.S. manufacturing has been hurt by high interest rates,
the result of Federal Reserve efforts to battle inflation.
   Most of the increase in factory orders in July came in
durable goods industries -- that is, businesses that produce
big-ticket items expected to last at least three years, such
as household appliances and industrial equipment. Orders for
durable goods rose 2.8% in July following a 3.1% drop in
June, while orders for nondurable goods, including food,
textiles and paper products, edged up only 0.2% after
slipping 0.4% in June.
   Economists generally dismissed the latest factory orders
numbers, as they have most reports on the country's economic
activities in July. They note that rising oil prices brought
on by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2 have cast new
uncertainty on the economic outlook.
   Orders totaled $240.35 billion in July. Factories'
shipments of goods slipped 0.8% during the month, after
inching up 0.2% in June. Order backlogs grew 0.6%, offsetting
a 0.6% decline in June. Inventories increased 0.7% following
a 0.5% drop.
