   Worried that the costs could put it out of business, a
small Midland, Texas, oil-drilling consulting firm stopped
paying its idled Middle East workers, some of whom are being
held as hostages.
   "We just absolutely don't have the money to pay them,"
said T.B. O'Brien, president of O'Brien-Goins-Simpson Inc.,
whose OGE Drilling Inc. unit employed 18 contract workers in
Kuwait. Two employees were away on vacation when the country
was invaded by Iraq Aug. 2. Ten of the remaining 16 workers
escaped Kuwait.

   "When they got out of the country, they weren't working
anymore," Mr. O'Brien said of the employees who left the
Middle East, "and they are off the payroll." OGE Drilling is
extending that decision to the six workers who are still in
the Middle East. Two employees, who had been working near the
Iraqi border, were captured and taken to Baghdad, Mr. O'Brien
said. The four others are believed to be in Kuwait. If OGE
Drilling continued to pay those workers, "in a very few
months, we won't be in business," the executive said.
   Mr. O'Brien said O'Brien-Goins has sales of about $4
million a year, about a third of which comes from OGE
Drilling, a company formed almost 11 years ago to work for
Kuwait Oil Co., a unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corp. "The sole
source of income for {OGE Drilling} is the work that was
going on in Kuwait," Mr. O'Brien said.
   But idled workers and their dependents are miffed by the
company's decision.
   "I just feel absolutely abandoned," said Patricia Hale of
Spring, Texas. Her husband, Edward, was a rig supervisor for
OGE Drilling. Mrs. Hale said she has hired an attorney to
advise her. O'Brien-Goins is "terribly out of step with the
way other oil field companies are handling the crisis," Mrs.
Hale said. She is physically unable to work and has an
$18,000 medical bill, she says.
   Mr. O'Brien said he appreciates the plight of the workers
and their families. "We have paid expenses that are not our
obligation and done everything we knew how to do to help
these people," he said, including contacting the Texas
Employment Commission about benefits. He said he was first
told the workers would have to apply in person.
   Bill Grossenbacher, administrator for the Texas Employment
Commission, confirmed that the commission's regulations
require that applicants appear in person to file a claim. But
he said there are provisions that could be "broadly"
interpreted to allow families of hostages to receive
unemployment benefits.
   "We've never had a case like this before," said Mr.
Grossenbacher.
   Donnita Cole of Odessa, Texas, whose husband, John, is a
captive, scoffed at the idea of receiving unemployment
compensation. "It won't even pay my telephone bill," she
said. Her August bill was $700 because of calls to Saudi
Arabia, California and Florida seeking information about her
husband. The maximum unemployment check is $217 a week for 26
weeks, Mr. Grossenbacher said.
   Mrs. Cole also says there's no reason to apply, because
her husband wasn't fired and didn't quit his job. "He is
still under contract to OGE," she says.
   Mr. O'Brien counters that the company is simply too small
to do more. Already, O'Brien-Goins has incurred more than
$500,000 in expenses that Kuwait can't repay because Kuwaiti
assets were frozen after the invasion. Part of that was the
cost of flying about 20 people -- workers and dependents --
back to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia after they left Kuwait, he
said.
   "If we don't get this money back, we aren't going to have
to pay any income tax for several years," Mr. O'Brien said.
"We're not broke, but we are severely bent."
