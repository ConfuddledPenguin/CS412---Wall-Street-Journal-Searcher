   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Daimler-Benz AG said first-half
group profit rose 1.2% to 840 million marks ($538.4 million)
from 830 million marks a year earlier.
   Sales at the Stuttgart-based company, West Germany's
largest industrial group, rose 9.9% to 40.38 billion marks
from 38.72 billion marks.

   But Daimler noted that its year-earlier data exclude
results of the Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. aerospace
subsidiary that was acquired in the 1989 second half.
Adjusting year-earlier figures to include the results of
Messerschmitt, Daimler's world-wide group sales rose 5.3% in
the first half from 38.34 billion marks in the first six
months of 1989.
   The Mercedes-Benz AG vehicle manufacturing division again
accounted for the majority of Daimler's world-wide sales from
all business lines. The producer of luxury autos boosted its
global sales 6.4% to 29.55 billion marks from 27.79 billion
marks. Daimler said Mercedes lifted output 2.6% to 285,484
autos from 278,342. The passenger car lines lifted sales to
17.6 billion marks from 16.36 billion marks.
   Daimler's West German sales, including those of
Messerschmitt, rose 12% to 16.45 billion marks from 14.75
billion marks. In the other 11 member countries of the
European Community, Daimler had sales of 25.65 billion marks,
up 7.5% from 23.86 billion marks a year earlier. Outside the
EC, Daimler's sales rose 1.9% to 14.73 billion marks from
14.48 billion marks.
   Daimler said its first-half earnings growth was damped
substantially by negative foreign-currency effects, arising
primarily from the strength of the mark against the dollar
and the yen. West German multinationals in general this year
are being hurt by foreign-currency translation losses.
Daimler said the negative currency effect was so strong that
price increases and higher unit sales in the vehicle
manufacturing business, as well as higher sales volumes in
other operating areas, could only partly offset it. Higher
wages and salaries for Daimler employees in West Germany also
damped profit growth, the company said.
   Daimler reiterated that for all of 1990, it expects to
boost world-wide group sales to about 85 billion marks --
including about six million marks of Messerschmitt sales --
from 76.39 billion marks in 1989. Daimler added that, based
on its "generally stable order levels," it expects 1990
earnings to be "satisfactory," but it didn't elaborate. For
1989, Daimler initially posted profit of 1.7 billion marks,
little changed from a year earlier, but it recently revised
that figure to 6.81 billion marks, to include extraordinary
gains resulting from an adjustment in its accounting method.
