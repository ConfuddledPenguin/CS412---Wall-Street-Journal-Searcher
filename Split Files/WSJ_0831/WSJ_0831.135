   BUSH CALLED FOR international assistance to finance the
blockade of Iraq.
   Asserting that the shape of the post-Cold War world is at
stake in the Persian Gulf, the president also urged economic
aid for countries hurt by the Gulf crisis. Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, meanwhile, put new bureaucratic obstacles in the
path of the Western women and children he had pledged to
release, prompting an angry response from Washington. The
Iraqi ambassador to the U.S. denied reports that his nation
demanded that planes arriving to pick up hostages deliver
food and medicine. In Jordan, the U.N.'s Perez de Cuellar
arrived for talks today with Baghdad's foreign minister.

   Gorbachev said he welcomed the adoption of sovereignty
declarations by Soviet republics, calling then a "major
achievement" of his restructuring program. But the Soviet
president appeared to distinguish between declarations of
sovereignty, which entail greater autonomy, and declarations
of independence that call for secession.
                                                                                                       

   Armenian officials said 250 members of a nationalist
paramilitary group gave up their weapons after the republic
declared a state of emergency and surrounded their
headquarters with soldiers and tanks. The surrender was
viewed as a victory for Armenia's Parliament, which issued an
independence declaration last week.
