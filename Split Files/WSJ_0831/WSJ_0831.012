   SANDUSKY, Ohio -- Cedar Fair L.P. will spend more than $9
million to upgrade its Cedar Point amusement park for the
1991 season, about the same amount as the partnership
invested at the Sandusky park for 1990, according to Cedar
Fair Management Co., the managing general partner.
   The major 1991 project is the addition of a $7.5 million
wooden roller coaster, the company said. The 160-foot-tall
addition will be the world's tallest wooden roller coaster
and will make Cedar Point the only amusement park with 10
roller coasters, the company said.
