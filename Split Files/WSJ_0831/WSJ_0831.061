   HONG KONG -- The Persian Gulf crisis has given Beijing a
chance to reassert its role in international politics, and
analysts believe China could thaw the diplomatic chill that
Western nations imposed after the Tiananmen Square killings.
   Things were easing even before the Middle East
confrontation, but China's move to return to global good
graces began in earnest several days after Iraq invaded
Kuwait, with Beijing's agreement to halt arms sales to
Baghdad, effectively joining the U.S.-led multinational
effort against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

   China strengthened its position by voting with the U.S. on
two resolutions in the United Nations Security Council. Last
Sunday, Beijing pledged qualified support to the U.S. for the
use of minimum military force to maintain the economic
embargo against Iraq. And on Tuesday, China agreed with the
U.S. and the Soviet Union on a peace plan for Cambodia.
   Analysts believe that by siding with Washington on these
issues, Beijing expects to be repaid by a further warming of
Sino-U.S. relations. "China has reaped a handsome windfall in
diplomacy," says Lo Chi-kin, a political commentator in Hong
Kong. "The Persian Gulf crisis is the turning point that will
bring foreign nations back to China."
   All this represents a radical shift from the situation 15
months ago, when many Western powers suspended high-level
contacts with Beijing and imposed economic sanctions on China
in response to the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators on
June 4, 1989. Some nations have since relaxed the strictures,
though occasionally at a cost to China. The U.S. decision to
extend China's most-favored-nation trade status, for example,
was apparently helped by the agreement to let prominent
dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife leave their yearlong
refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   The diplomatic points scored with the Gulf crisis add to
similar gains in Southeast Asia that could enhance China's
regional role. Earlier this month, Indonesia formally
restored ties with Beijing, and Singapore expects to follow
suit soon.
   Sorting out its political and economic interests in the
Middle East is a tricky task for Beijing. China has been
neutral in previous Mideast disputes, such as the Iran-Iraq
war, and has sided with the Arabs against Israel. Such
positions made China an unlikely ally of the U.S. in the Gulf
crisis.
   In addition, Beijing has ties to both Iraq and Kuwait.
China has sold Iraq about $4 billion in arms in the past
decade, and it received multibillion-dollar concessionary
loans from Kuwait.
   But all these considerations apparently gave way before
China's desire to reclaim a place on the geopolitical stage.
"Beijing's overriding concern is how to raise its
international stature," says Joseph Cheng, a dean at the Open
Learning Institute of Hong Kong. Adds a Hong Kong-based
Western diplomat, "China doesn't want to be left out of the
Western camp."
   China actually killed two birds with one stone by joining
the Western effort to isolate Saddam Hussein. When Richard
Solomon, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, persuaded
China's leaders to halt arms sales to Iraq, his visit to
Beijing not only raised China's international stature but it
also ended the freeze on high-level official contact the U.S.
had imposed on Beijing.
   No one is expecting Sino-U.S. relations to revert
immediately to their pre-Tiananmen state. Washington, for
instance, probably would want Beijing to give a better
accounting of those arrested after the suppression of
democratic protests last year, diplomats say. But progress
could accelerate, they add.
   "The entire climate has been changed, and China's return
to the world community is anticipated," says the Western
diplomat.
   Analysts say the chief factor in renewing China's
international role is its place among the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, each of which has veto
power over proposed resolutions. China's seat in that body
gave it a say in the course of events in the Gulf, and could
have torpedoed the U.S.-backed initiative to use military
force to maintain the economic embargo on Iraq.
   Beijing's decision to give qualified support to the
resolution surprised many analysts, who had expected at least
an abstention. "Now Washington is indebted to Beijing, and
China is expecting rewards for its cooperation," says Mr. Lo.
   In another show of cooperation with the West, China
supported a Security Council resolution for U.N.
administration of Cambodia until a new government is elected.
Chinese aid to the communist Khmer Rouge has been a major
obstacle to a Cambodian peace settlement. Tuesday's
resolution doesn't mean that China is withdrawing its arms
sales to the Khmer Rouge, but diplomats say it appears to be
more accommodating than before.
