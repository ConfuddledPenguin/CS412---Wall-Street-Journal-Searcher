   LONDON -- Hanson PLC said it plans to cut its stake in
Newmont Mining Corp. to about 26% from 49% through a public
offering of shares in the U.S. gold-mining company.
   Hanson would raise about $378 million in the first stage
of the transaction. The U.K. industrial conglomerate will
offer 8.4 million of its 33 million Newmont shares. Newmont
separately will offer 3.6 million shares and plans to offer
six million warrants, each of which would entitle holders to
buy an additional Newmont common share. Hanson's stake in
Newmont will drop to 26% if the warrants are fully exercised.

   The move, which some Hanson investors have anticipated
since Hanson acquired the Newmont stake in its #3.5 billion
($6.81 billion) takeover of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC last
year, will generate cash for Hanson. A spokeswoman said
Hanson could use proceeds to refinance its #6.5 billion in
debt or add to its #6.6 billion acquisition war chest.
   In a statement, Sir Gordon White, chairman of the
company's Hanson Industries unit, said the offering "will
permit Newmont to raise additional capital and, at the same
time, affords the opportunity to monetize a portion of our
investment while continuing to maintain a significant stake
in Newmont."
   Some analysts have questioned whether the structure of the
transaction reflects Hanson's inability to find a single
buyer for its entire Newmont stake. "Hanson thought that its
49% stake in Newmont would be very saleable, but as it turned
out nobody wanted to buy it," said William Siedenburg, metals
analyst for Smith Barney. "To dispose of it, they had to come
up with this plan."
   The Hanson spokeswoman said the company "reviews all
options. In any situation a variety of alternatives have been
viewed." She wouldn't comment on whether Hanson had held
talks with possible purchasers for the entire Newmont stake.
   On London's Stock Exchange, Hanson rose 3.5 pence to 211
pence. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Newmont
fell $3.375 to $44.50.
   For Newmont, based in Denver, the sale of 3.6 million
shares will contribute about $160 million to a rapidly
growing exploration and acquisition fund. Only three days
ago, Newmont said it had agreed to sell 20% of Newmont
Australia Ltd. for $137.7 million and that it intends to sell
the company's remaining 24% stake in the unit.
   With debt of only about $450 million, Newmont says it
intends to apply the proceeds largely to the pursuit of new
gold properties, either through exploration of new deposits
or acquisition of existing ones. The company is focusing its
exploration efforts on Indonesia and Papa New Guinea.
   The 3.6 million new shares will bring Newmont's shares
outstanding to about 71.2 million, an increase of about 5%.
Combined with the potential sale of 14.4 million Newmont
shares by Hanson, that will place a much larger chunk of
Newmont into the hands of the public and, potentially, an
unwanted suitor.
   It was to avoid a marriage with T. Boone Pickens in 1987
that Newmont took on enormous amounts of debt and wound up
with 49% of its stock owned by a white knight, Consolidated
Gold Fields. Subsequently, Hanson bought Newmont's 55% stake
in Peabody Holding Co. for $715 million, enabling Newmont to
pay some debt and reduce payments from $100 million in 1988
to less than $20 million this year.
   This time, Newmont officials aren't taking any chances. In
the statement announcing the stock offering, the company also
said it adopted a "poison pill" provison that would give
shareholders preferred stock purchase rights exercisable as
soon as anyone other than Hanson acquires a 15% stake or
launches a tender offer for that amount or more.
