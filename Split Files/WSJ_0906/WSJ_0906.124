   CalMat Co. said a unit of Onoda Cement Co. of Japan is
exercising its right to acquire a CalMat unit, California
Portland Cement Co., in exchange for its 19% stake in CalMat.
   Under a 1988 agreement, CalMat, based in Los Angeles, has
the option of swapping the stock of its wholly owned
California Portland Cement subsidiary for Onoda's 5,834,070
CalMat shares. The stock-for-asset swap stems from CalMat's
restructuring that thwarted a potential takeover by New
Zealand investor Sir Ronald Brierley two years ago.

   The stock of California Portland Cement was initially
valued at $310 million. Under the agreement, Onoda's CalMat
shares are to be valued at the higher of $39.31 a share or
current market value. CalMat's stock closed at $31.875, up 25
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   The acquisition value will be adjusted to give CalMat the
benefit of California Portland Cement's earnings from the
date of the agreement and reflect changes in California
Portland Cement's capitalization. CalMat said it expects to
receive a payment, in the form of a dividend from California
Portland Cement and assumption of debt by Onoda. The
transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter.
