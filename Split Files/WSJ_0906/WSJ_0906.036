   Princeton University researchers have found a strong link
between students' future income and spending on teaching at
the schools they attend.
   The study is the latest contribution to a heated debate
over the relationship between spending and educational
quality, and it challenges the thinking behind many recent
moves to improve schools.

   A large body of analysis over the last 20 years has shown
little connection between spending and school quality. But
most of these studies focus on whether students' standardized
test scores rise when money is spent in such areas as hiring
more teachers. Taking a different tack, Princeton's David
Card and Alan Krueger found that public schools with lower
student-teacher ratios and better-paid teachers increased
their students' earning power. Students' future wages were
also boosted by schools with longer academic years.
   For each year of schooling above eighth grade, Messrs.
Card and Krueger say, students gain about 0.4% in annual
income by attending schools with five fewer students per
teacher. Raising teachers' salaries 10% increases students'
future incomes by 0.1%, they maintain. The researchers
studied the education and incomes of a million men born
between 1920 and 1949 who attended public school.
   The gains from five fewer students per teacher were about
1.6% for workers who only finished high school and 3.2% for
the college-educated -- big enough to justify added school
spending "in terms of tax revenues on the added income
alone," Mr. Krueger says.
   In a district of about 3,000 students, he figures, $6
million spent over 12 school years to lower the
student-teacher ratio to 25 to 1 from 30 to 1 will yield
about $29.4 million in lifetime earnings gains to the
students. Based on a 25% tax rate, the added income generates
$7.4 million in federal income taxes. The outlays, income and
taxes are discounted to reflect their current value.
   Although many school reformers have advocated reining in
spending and making educators more accountable for results
instead, "we found that the additional investment in schools
is worth it," Mr. Krueger says. "What this shows is that
small spending increases will generate a pretty big return to
society."
   Messrs. Krueger and Card say their statistical analysis
"controlled" for such factors as race, parental income and
relative regional wealth. That means they found income gains
of the same proportion for whites and blacks, rich and poor,
and even when men worked in a state other than the one where
they went to school.
   Critics of the value of big school budgets remain
skeptical. "It's a very interesting thing they've done, but I
would be extremely dubious of any causal relationship"
between income and high-spending schools, says James S.
Coleman, a professor of sociology and education at the
University of Chicago. In a widely quoted 1966 study, Mr.
Coleman concluded that spending mattered little to how much
students learned.
   Mr. Coleman says that he hasn't seen the Princeton study,
but he contends it would be hard to control for such factors
as family background, which he believes to be one of the the
most important determinants of how much a child gets from
education. What's more, he says, higher income can come about
from a lot besides good education, while higher test results
have a more "proximate" relationship to quality schooling.
When test scores are used, he says, few studies show any
gains from higher expenditures.
   The Princeton researchers acknowledge that their analysis
has limitations. Women weren't included because their
participation in the work force wasn't great enough to
produce reliable results using data from the 1980 census.
   Mr. Card also says it's an open question whether the
income gains will be as strong in the future. During the
school years of the men under study, student-teacher ratios
dropped sharply, to 17 to 1 from as high as 35 to 1 in some
states. This rate of change isn't likely in the future,
though the Princeton pair believes there would be gains even
from small improvements.
   One surprise finding in the study is that students' future
incomes were hurt when they had more male teachers. A 10
percentage point drop in female teachers at a school produced
0.3% less annual income for students for each year of
schooling -- or about 2.4% over the life of a college
graduate. Mr. Krueger says he has no plausible scientific
explanation and was puzzled by the correlation, but he adds
that "my mother, who was a teacher, wasn't surprised at all."
