   WASHINGTON -- The Transportation Department tentatively
granted authority to Alaska Airlines and Federal Express
Corp. to begin air service to the Soviet Union.
   Alaska Airlines, a unit of Seattle-based Alaska Air Group
Inc., would be permitted to carry passengers and cargo
between Anchorage, Alaska, and Magadan and Khabarovsk in the
Soviet Union. Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., will
provide all-cargo service on a North Atlantic route between
New York and Moscow and Leningrad.

   The actions stem from an aviation agreement in June by the
U.S. and the Soviet Union to expand air service between the
two nations. Pan American World Airways, a unit of New
York-based Pan Am Corp., now is the only U.S. carrier that
provides service.
   If the department makes the authority final, which is
expected, the routes will take effect April 1 and remain in
effect for two years.
   Alaska Airlines said: "We have been working toward this
for a couple of years. We hope to begin service in mid-June."
   A spokesman for Federal Express said the express delivery
concern didn't have any immediate comment on the
Transportation Department's action.
   The department will designate three more airlines to carry
passengers and cargo to the Soviet Union and an additional
carrier for all-cargo service.
