   OTTAWA -- Canada is expected to harvest a bumper grain
crop this year, threatening tough competition on the
international grain market.
   Statistics Canada, a federal agency, estimated yesterday
that the Canadian wheat crop, which is being harvested now,
will total 28.58 million metric tons, a 17% increase from
24.33 million tons last year. This would be the
second-largest Canadian wheat crop after the 1986 record crop
of 31.38 million tons. A metric ton of wheat is equal to
36.74 bushels.

   Canada is the second-largest wheat exporter after the
U.S., and the two countries compete aggressively in many of
the same wheat markets. "The Canadian Wheat Board will price
its grain at whatever level is needed to move it," said Shawn
McComb, international grain analyst at the WEFA Group, a
research organization. The board, a government agency,
handles exports of western Canadian wheat and barley.
   Brian Stacey, the board's spokesman, said grain market
conditions are "very tough" because of big crops in many
countries. But he said the board doesn't dump grain below
market prices.
   Mr. McComb estimated that Canada's wheat exports will rise
to 19.3 million metric tons in the year ending next July 31
from 17.16 million tons in the previous year, despite tough
competition from other wheat exporters.
   Statistics Canada estimated that Canadian spring wheat
production this year will rise 21% to 22.97 million metric
tons. Spring wheat, which is seeded in the spring and
harvested in the fall, is Canada's main wheat crop. Durum
wheat production is expected to decline 4% this year to 3.93
million tons. Durum is used to make pasta products.
   Patricia Mohr, Bank of Nova Scotia economist, said the
wheat board's asking export price for wheat has dropped to
US$137 a metric ton from US$206 a year ago. She said export
prices aren't covering the cost of the board's initial
payments to farmers and transportation to port. The board
makes initial payments to farmers based on its assessment of
market prospects early in the year.
   Statistics Canada estimated Canada's barley crop will
increase 11% this year to 12.9 million metric tons. Canada's
exports of barley will be hurt by the blockade of Iraq, which
was Canada's largest barley purchaser. A metric ton of barley
is equal to 45.93 bushels.
   Production of canola, or rapeseed, is expected to rise
6.1% to 3.3 million metric tons this year, despite a 9%
decline in canola acreage. Canola is Canada's major oilseed
crop. A metric ton of canola equals 44.09 bushels.
   Statistics Canada said a cool, wet spring slowed crop
development this year. But it said that "expectations are for
good yields in most regions."
