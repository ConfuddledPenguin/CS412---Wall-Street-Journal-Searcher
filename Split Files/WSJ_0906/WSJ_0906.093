   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- ImmunoGen Inc. said it filed an
application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to
begin clinical trials with an experimental drug for
small-cell lung tumors.
   The drug combines a highly toxic chemical called ricin
with a monoclonal antibody, the company said. The antibody,
an immune system protein, selectively sticks to lung tumor
cells. Thus, it carries the toxic ricin to such cells,
enabling it to kill the cells while minimizing the damage it
causes to normal cells. In addition, ImmunoGen employs a
chemically altered version of ricin that enhances the drug's
selective action against tumor cells.

   ImmunoGen said it expects to begin clinical trials of the
drug this fall.
   Small-cell lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers --
the five-year survival rate with conventional therapy is less
than 10%, the company said. An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 new
cases of the disease are diagnosed annually in the U.S.,
ImmunoGen said.
