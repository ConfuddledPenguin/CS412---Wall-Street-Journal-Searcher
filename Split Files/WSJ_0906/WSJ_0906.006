   The Food and Drug Administration faces a possible
avalanche of damage claims from Chilean fruit growers and
exporters who argue that the agency erred last year in
finding cyanide in two grapes and then embargoing all fruit
shipments from Chile.
   The anticipated claims will rely heavily on a new report
commissioned by the Chilean Exporters Association, which
concludes that the grapes couldn't have been injected with
cyanide in Chile but were contaminated in the FDA's
Philadelphia laboratory after being picked out of an enormous
shipload of grapes.

   Yesterday, an agency spokesman dismissed that finding as
"preposterous" and reiterated the agency's position that the
contamination "occurred either in Chile or the hold of the
ship."
   The embargo, imposed March 13, 1989, at the peak of the
fruit-shipping season, cost the Chilean government and
private sector an estimated $333 million, according to the
report. At the same time, losses for U.S. importers and other
businessmen totaled $40 million to $60 million.
   As many as 300 Chilean exporters representing 5,000
growers and 50 U.S. importers are expected to file notices of
claims against the FDA before the statute of limitations runs
out next March. If the government rejects the claim or fails
to respond within six months, the claimants can sue the FDA
under the federal torts claim law.
   "If each entity files, you'll have a mountain of paper,"
said David Holzworth, a Washington attorney for some major
U.S. importers.
   To simplify things, Foster Wollen, a partner in the
Washington office of Shearman &amp; Sterling, said he is looking
into the possibility of a class action. His firm's Chilean
clients include Compania Sud Americana de Vapores S.A., a
major steamship line, and a federation of fruit-grower
groups.
   To many Chileans, the unprecedented U.S. action was an
affront to their national pride. From the outset, the
populace has been highly skeptical of the U.S. version of the
so-called Great Grape Scare. Last week, the president of
Chile appointed a special panel of five lawyers to
investigate the matter as a prelude to a concerted effort to
collect damages.
   The Chilean government would prefer to negotiate a
settlement with the U.S. One possible approach would be to
invoke the bilateral Bryan Treaty of 1914, which provides for
the formation of an international commission to settle
disputes between Washington and Santiago.
   "The mere filing of a notice isn't necessarily an
aggressive, warlike action," said Mr. Wollen. Instead, he
said it puts claimants in a position to take legal action if
diplomatic initiatives fail.
   Any allegations of negligence against the FDA will likely
rest on the new report, which summarized months of research
at the University of California at Davis, underwritten by the
Chilean exporters. One of the key findings is that other
grapes in the crate containing the two contaminated grapes
should have been tainted, too, if somebody in Chile had
indeed injected them with highly volatile cyanide. But the
FDA reported finding no other contaminated grapes.
   Another finding is that none of the grapes injected with
cyanide in the California experiments developed the white
rings that led to the detection of the two suspect grapes.
What's more, additional experiments show that cyanide
dissipates very quickly due to its extreme volatility. For
the two grapes to contain as much cyanide as the FDA reported
finding, they would have had to contain more cyanide than
they could possibly hold at the time of their discovery on
the dock, about nine hours before the FDA lab tests were
finished.
   "The clinical evidence rejects virtually any possibility
of contamination of the grapes in Chile or on the ship or at
the port of Philadelphia," the report said. "On the contrary,
the laboratory results only support the hypothesis that the
grapes were accidentally or intentionally contaminated inside
the FDA laboratory in Philadelphia."
   But a study to be released soon by the General Accounting
Office is expected to conclude that the FDA handled the
affair properly for the most part and that its lab procedures
were adequate. In the past, FDA officials in Philadelphia
have rejected the notion that the grapes could have become
contaminated while in FDA hands.

   SOFT-DRINK BOTTLERS' cooperatives upheld by federal
appeals court.
   The Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower
court's ruling that a cooperative formed by Coca-Cola
bottlers to make their own plastic bottles doesn't violate
federal antitrust law.
   Sewell Plastics Inc., an Atlanta bottlemaker, had filed
suit in Charlotte, N.C., in 1986 against Coca-Cola Co., 34
Coke bottlers and Southeastern Container Inc., a bottlemaking
cooperative, alleging the cooperative engaged in unfair trade
practices.
   The appeals court ruling, which upheld the lower court's
dismissal of the suit, also allowed a counterclaim against
Sewell to proceed. In the countersuit, Sewell, a unit of
Constar International Inc., Chattanooga, Tenn., is accused of
filing its suit for the improper purpose of trying to force
the bottlers to stop buying from the cooperative and return
to purchasing from Sewell. An attorney for Sewell couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Jonathan Jacobson, an attorney for the defendants, said
the appellate ruling is significant in upholding the rights
of bottlers to form cooperatives.
   Noting that soft-drink bottlers form cooperatives for
various purposes such as buying sugar and making cans, Mr.
Jacobson said an adverse decision would have meant "all the
bottling cooperatives would have been in trouble."

   LEAN CUISINE ADS were lean on facts about Weight Watchers,
judge rules.
   Weight Watchers International Inc., a unit of H.J. Heinz
Co., had filed a lawsuit accusing Stouffer Corp., which makes
Lean Cuisine frozen foods, of running misleading ads. The
ads, which ran in Parade magazine in 1987 and 1988, promoted
Lean Cuisine dishes as substitutes for Weight Watchers' own
line of diet foods.
   In federal court in Manhattan, Judge Michael Mukasey
ordered Stouffer, a Nestle S.A. subsidiary, not to run the
ads again. The judge ruled that the ads could confuse
consumers into believing that Lean Cuisine is either endorsed
by or related to Weight Watchers. He also ruled that a 1989
ad gave false information comparing Lean Cuisine to Weight
Watchers products.
   Although Judge Mukasey barred Stouffer from resurrecting
the ads, he stopped far short of the action sought by Weight
Watchers. The judge ruled against awarding any damages, and
he said Stouffer couldn't be prohibited from accurately
mentioning Weight Watchers in Lean Cuisine ads.
   A spokesman for Stouffers said the company considers the
decision a victory because it allows Stouffers to promote
Lean Cuisine as an alternative to Weight Watchers' own brand
of low-calorie food. He said the ads, which will begin soon,
will comply with Judge Mukasey's order.
   Weight Watchers had claimed that any use of its name in
the ads would be a trademark infringement.

   CONNECTICUT MUST NEGOTIATE with an Indian tribe seeking to
open a casino, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled. The court ruled that Connecticut illegally refused to
discuss the request of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe. The
tribe wants to offer "Las Vegas nights" casino gambling on
its reservation in Ledyard, Conn. Under federal law, the
tribe must reach an agreement with the state before adding
such activities. Connecticut refused to discuss the proposal,
claiming that state law prohibits such games of chance. The
federal appeals-court panel, however, ordered the state to
negotiate in good faith on the request.

   INTEGRATED RESOURCES INC. received a 60-day extension on
its "exclusivity period," the time in which only it can
officially propose a reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code. The exclusivity period was to
have expired Sept. 11. Integrated, a former real estate
syndicator that has been operating under bankruptcy-law
protection since February, had sought a 120-day extension
from U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard C. Buschman III, in
New York.
