   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan's consumer price index in August
climbed 5.63% from a year earlier, marking the biggest
year-to-year growth since last October, when the index soared
5.94%, the government said.
   The August index, in which 1986 prices equal 100, stood at
112.4, compared with 106.41 a year earlier, and was up 1.65%
from 110.58 in July. The latter was the biggest monthly gain
since September 1989, the agency said.
