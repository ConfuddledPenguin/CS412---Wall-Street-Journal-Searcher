   LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- China will abide by an
international ban on trade in ivory, according to an
organization that monitors trade in endangered wildlife
species.
   Beijing's decision was prompted by the closure of
traditional export markets in Japan, the U.S. and Western
Europe where governments have outlawed all ivory trade,
according to Jacques Bernez of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species.

   Beijing told the group it will become party to the ban
next January, Mr. Bernez said.
   The 103-nation group agreed on the ivory trade ban in an
attempt to protect dwindling herds of African elephants.
