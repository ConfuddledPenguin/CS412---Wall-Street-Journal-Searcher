   LARAMIE, Wyo. -- The pilgrims have begun to arrive.
   Just now passing the WYO Motel and the Suntan Salon are
two New York attorneys, who crossed the prairie in a silver
Lincoln Town Car to meet their heroine, Becky Klemt. They
think she is the funniest lawyer in America.

   Awaiting the arrival of her fans, Ms. Klemt has a touch of
the jitters. "It's all a little weird, them coming out here
just to meet me," she says, pacing the office floor at her
four-partner law firm, Pence &amp; MacMillan. "It's become like a
cult. Look, I just wrote one funny letter."
   Yet few landmark Supreme Court decisions seem likely to
evoke the kind of comment that Ms. Klemt's two pages of prose
have. Lawyers have called it "hilarious," "brutal," and "the
best writing on legal stationery."
   Written two years ago in response to a hyped letter from a
high-priced attorney in California, Ms. Klemt's letter,
admirers say, skewers the pretentiousness of big-city
lawyering with incomparable wit. Both letters were copied,
and facsimiles have gone from lawyer to lawyer around the
globe, elevating the 35-year-old Ms. Klemt from small-town
practitioner to legal celebrity.
   She has received hundreds of telephone calls and fan
letters, job offers, legal referrals from places as distant
as London, and marriage proposals. International Creative
Management, the talent agency, wrote to compliment her on the
"most photocopied letter in legal history" and asked her to
sign on as a literary client.
   "Her letter is a masterpiece," says federal Judge Warren
Eginton of Bridgeport, Conn. "Lawyers, lately, have become
pretty full of themselves. They need someone to bring them
back to reality."
   "It's the pot-shot heard round the world," says Jordan
Thaler, associate casting director for the New York
Shakespeare Festival, who got copies of the letters from a
lawyer friend in Paris. "I think Becky Klemt should read her
letters at Carnegie Hall: Joseph Papp presents `Our Lady from
Laramie.'"
   Our lady was quietly toiling in the vineyards of Wyoming
jurisprudence two years ago when she won a $4,240
child-support judgment on behalf of Marcia Broomell, whose
ex-husband had fled to Los Angeles. In attempting to collect
the award -- a tidy sum by Laramie standards but a pittance
in Los Angeles -- Ms. Klemt collided with one of the bitter
realities of practicing law in the supercharged 1980s.
   Searching for a lawyer, any lawyer, to collect the
judgment, she sent scores of requests to Los Angeles law
firms. "It's entirely possible," she pleaded in one, "that a
single letter to Mr. Broomell will be all that's needed."
There were no takers.
   Finally, a response arrived that left Ms. Klemt stunned.
"Without sounding pretentious," wrote Stephen G. Corris, a
solo practitioner in Irvine, Calif., "my current retainer for
cases is a flat $100,000, with an additional charge of $1,000
per hour. Since I specialize in international trade and
geopolitical relations between the Middle East and Europe, my
clientel (sic) is very unique and limited, and I am afraid I
am unable to accept other work at this time."
   Ms. Klemt responded: "Steve, I've got news -- you can't
say you charge a $100,000 retainer fee and an additional
$1,000 an hour without sounding pretentious. . . . Especially
when you're writing to someone in Laramie, Wyoming, where
you're considered pretentious if you wear socks to Court. . .
. Hell, Steve, all the lawyers in Laramie, put together,
don't charge $1,000 an hour."
   Still, Ms. Klemt wrote, Pence &amp; MacMillan had an
international flavor, sort of. People at the firm regularly
ordered Mexican food, and one partner had actually studied a
foreign language, Latin, in high school. Perhaps a merger was
in order?
   "Steve," she wrote, "let us know when we should join you
in California so that we can begin doing whatever it is you
do. In anticipation of our move, we've all been practicing
trying to say we charge $1,000 an hour with a straight face,
but so far, we haven't been able to do it. . . . Anyway,
because I'll be new to the area of international trade and
geopolitical relations, I'm thinking of only charging
$500-$600 an hour to begin with. Will that cover our
overhead?"
   "P.S.: Incidentally, we have advised our client of your
hourly rate. She is willing to pay you $1,000 per hour to
collect this judgment provided it doesn't take you more than
four seconds."
   Debora MacMillan, sister of Pence &amp; MacMillan's senior
partner, Hoke MacMillan, passed copies of the pair of letters
to her boss, Colorado court of appeals Judge John A.
Criswell, who then copied sets for his 15 fellow judges on
the court. Some of them wired out facsimiles to friends. The
rest is legal history.
   Ms. Klemt, a University of Wyoming Law School graduate,
had been spending most of her time representing ranchers and
serving on the state parole board. "My only notable legal
writing at that point was an article I published in the Land
and Water Law Review," she says.
   Reaction to her Dear Steve letter quickly followed. First,
there was a marriage proposal -- actually, more of a
long-distance, speaker-phone group grope by three attorneys
in Chicago. Then came adoring letters from a judge and a
lawschool professor, and job offers from a big San Francisco
law firm and Compaq Computer Corp.
   Robert M. McGreevey, now the second-ranking attorney at
Amoco Corp., calls her letter "a jewel in the desert." He has
recommended that Amoco's regional office in Denver use her as
outside counsel, "solely on the basis of her letter." Toyota
Motor Corp. felt the same, and retained her on a case in
Cheyenne that she has just finished.
   Mary McGuire Voog, associate general counsel of TWA Corp.,
and one of the two visiting lawyers from New York, got the
letters from the No. 2 counsel at Pan Am Corp. Ms. Voog
passed them on as something of a peace offering to Ian
Fagelson, a London solicitor with whom she had just finished
a rather bitter negotiation over his rates. Mr. Fagelson
called Laramie to check that the letters were authentic, and
then called Ms. Voog to say he had reached Ms. Klemt.
   "I told Ian, `Well that must be the first call she's ever
received from London,'" Ms. Voog recalls as she settles into
a leather chair at Pence &amp; MacMillan. "He said, `First call?
It's not even the first call she's gotten today]'"
   Ms. Klemt, accustomed to such tales of far-flung
celebrity, tells the visitors of her idea for Klemtville, a
retreat for stressed-out lawyers; it would offer group
therapy and rides on a horse named Satan. The New York
visitors, who spend a day riding among the deer and the
antelope at a nearby dude ranch and then talk about what's
wrong with lawyering over giant slabs of prime rib, leave
with saddle sores but in touch with their legal souls.
   The obligation to pithily answer scores of calls and
letters -- to give her fans what they want -- has turned Ms.
Klemt into something of a prairie philosopher. Law schooling,
she says, aims "to convince the overconfident that they are
truly superior." Of legal pomposity: "Most lawyers refuse to
itemize it in their bills."
   Meanwhile, her firm has moved into new offices, partly to
match its higher profile and handle the business that her
letter has generated. Some clients have worried that the
firm's rates will rise. Ms. Klemt, who still charges $85 an
hour, says she is considering an increase -- to $90. "That's
plenty of money for what I provide," she says -- an opinion
that might be grounds for disbarment in New York.
   And what of Stephen G. Corris, butt of a thousand faxes?
Mr. Corris, 45 years old, says he is a part-time author of
thrillers, former Orange County prosecutor and veteran of
military intelligence. He is often quoted by news media as a
Middle East specialist. He concedes he overstated his fees to
Ms. Klemt; he says his usual charge is closer to $500 a hour.
"I got calls from one Washington firm and two in New York,"
he says, "basically asking, `How are you pulling this off?'
They wanted a piece of my action. I said get lost."
   Last month, Ms. Klemt wrote off the fees owed her by
Marcia Broomell in the unsuccessful attempt to collect the
$4,240. "I figured I've gotten enough mileage out of this
case," she says.
   "Sure, sure, it's all incredible," says Ms. Broomell, who
has moved to Abilene, Texas. "Now a thousand lawyers know
about my plight, and not one of them can be bothered to
collect my money]"
