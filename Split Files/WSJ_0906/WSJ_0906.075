   HOUSTON -- Santa Fe Energy Resources Inc. said it entered
into crude oil and natural gas exploration and development
agreements with the governments of Argentina and Bolivia, for
an area totaling about 5.9 million acres.
   The independent exploration and production concern said
the agreements represent its first operations in Bolivia and
its fourth production sharing venture with the Argentine
government. Santa Fe Energy said it expects to begin seismic
activity on both projects in 1991.
