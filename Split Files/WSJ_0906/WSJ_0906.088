   The State Department received a report yesterday that a
male U.S. citizen had been shot and wounded in Kuwait City by
Iraqi soldiers while he was trying to avoid being captured.
   A department spokesman said the U.S. didn't have any
information about the severity of the injuries. He said the
U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City had contacted the hospital where
it believed the wounded American had been taken, but
"hospital officials said they had no knowledge of the
incident," according to a statement released last night.

   The State Department said efforts to obtain more
information from Iraqi authorities in Kuwait "have been in
vain." The official added that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad
had been told to contact Iraq's Foreign Ministry "to demand
consular access to the citizen."
   Meanwhile, in Baghdad, Saddam Hussein again called for a
holy war against American forces in the Persian Gulf and
their Arab allies, as President Bush, who will address a
joint session of Congress next week, warned that sanctions
against Iraq must succeed or "we will review our options."
   The tough language from Baghdad contrasted sharply with
efforts by Saddam Hussein to appear conciliatory by releasing
foreign women and children being held hostage. Yesterday,
some 175 more foreigners, including 24 Americans, were
permitted to leave, and the State Department said nine more
Americans may be released today.
   Even as the hostages were departing, Saddam Hussein said
Iraqi children could starve as a result of the U.S.-led
embargo. He also called for the overthrow of the governments
of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and vowed in a television and
radio message that the West would be "disastrously defeated."
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James Baker told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. might tighten the
embargo further by seeking United Nations authority to
intercept aircraft carrying supplies to Iraq. Mr. Baker said
the U.S. so far hasn't sought such authority because it
doesn't believe Baghdad "can supply itself solely from the
air." There have been reports that aircraft from some
nations, including Libya, may have delivered supplies to
Iraq. "So far, we don't think the leakage by air has been all
that significant," Mr. Baker said. "But it is something we
are watching."
   The Bush administration is continuing its efforts to shore
up domestic and international support for the Gulf effort,
which increasingly appears could become a lengthy standoff.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger and Pentagon Undersecretary Paul
Wolfowitz headed for South Korea and Japan to solicit cash
and other contributions to help the Gulf effort. The American
delegation had traveled earlier to France and Britain.
   The U.S. has avoided setting a specific goal for foreign
contributions, but a senior official in the Brady delegation
suggested other countries should meet the added costs above
the Pentagon's normal operating budget -- about $1 billion a
month.
   "I think it's not unreasonable to ask the allies to pick
up all of it," the official said. "After all, they couldn't
buy this kind of capability anywhere else in the world."
   In addition, the group hopes to raise an estimated $3.5
billion to help Egypt, Jordan and Turkey through the rest of
this year. Those countries have been hit particularly hard by
the Iraqi invasion and the U.S.-led embargo. "It's absolutely
critical we get the money for the front-line states," Mr.
Brady told reporters at a briefing in London.
   Mr. Baker is set to lead a parallel support-raising
mission to Europe and the Middle East. Washington is
particularly interested in "in-kind" payments, such as oil,
transportation services and medical supplies, because they
keep the U.S. military commitment from appearing to be a
mercenary operation.
   President Bush is scheduled to meet on Sunday with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev in Helsinki, Finland, to discuss
the crisis. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
yesterday that Soviet cooperation in the Gulf had led the
U.S. to look more favorably on the idea of providing economic
aid to the Soviets. "I think it's fair to say that the Soviet
cooperation in the Gulf has impressed us to the point that we
are even more interested in being supportive economically if
we can be," Mr. Fitzwater said.
   In his appearance next Tuesday on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bush
is expected to articulate America's long-term goals in the
Gulf. Mr. Baker, in congressional testimony twice this week,
argued that it is important for the U.S. to stay the course.
Yesterday, he said, "It's important that the American people
understand that a degree of patience will be required here."
   President Bush met yesterday morning with most members of
the bipartisan congressional delegation that recently visited
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bush told the lawmakers he
was "most gratified by the repeated statements of support for
U.S. determination to see this mission through and to
maintain U.S. forces until our goals are achieved," according
to Mr. Fitzwater.
   Mr. Fitzwater also said the president called U.S.
Ambassador W. Nathanial Howell in the U.S. embassy in Kuwait
yesterday to thank him and the staff for holding out against
Iraqi demands that the embassy be closed. The embassy is
surrounded by Iraqi soldiers and water and power have been
shut off.
   For several weeks, the Iraqis have been rounding up
Americans in Kuwait to use them as "shields" to deter a U.S.
attack on its military facilities. A State Department
official said yesterday's shooting incident took place last
evening Kuwait time. Last month, one of the Americans being
used as a "shield" died of a heart attack.
   Mr. Fitzwater also called Saddam Hussein's latest speech
"another rhetorical diatribe designed to split Arab unity."
He added: "We see it as a sign of desperation that Iraq is
lashing out with hypocrisy and irrelevant statements."
