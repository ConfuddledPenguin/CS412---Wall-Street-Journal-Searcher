   SECURITY PACIFIC Corp. of Los Angeles said it plans to
sell $125 million of floating rate notes. Proceeds would be
used for general corporate purposes. The rate on the notes,
which will be priced at par, will be reset quarterly at 25
basis points above the three-month London interbank offered
rates. A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.
Interest will be paid quarterly. The notes mature Sept. 15,
1993, and are non-callable over the life of the issue.
