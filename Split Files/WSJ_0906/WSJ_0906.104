   DETROIT -- Sales of North American-made cars and trucks
dropped 21% in late August, reflecting consumers' uncertainty
about the softening U.S. economy as the Mideast crisis moves
into its sixth week.
   The seasonally adjusted annual sales pace of 7.1 million
cars would normally be considered reasonable, and suffered
largely by comparison with the unusually strong rate of 8.2
million cars in the same period a year earlier. But only
strong gains in U.S. production by a handful of Japanese auto
makers breathed some life into the late-August sales figures.

<TEXT>
   Overall sales of domestic and imported cars and trucks for
all of August -- a far better economic indicator than the
late-August domestic totals -- dropped 17% from a year
earlier.
   In total, the Japanese got a record 34% of U.S. car sales
for the month, up from 29% a year earlier. The U.S. Big Three
auto makers took just 60% of the market, down from 65% in
August of 1989.
   The surge in Japanese market share may reflect budding
concern about fuel prices, and also the Japanese success in
attracting younger, more affluent buyers who are less
affected by economic uncertainty. Economic concerns, however,
are being highlighted by the Mideast crisis, and making many
Americans wary of buying new vehicles.
   The 10 major makers of domestic vehicles sold a total of
389,427 cars and trucks in the Aug. 21-31 period, compared
with 492,763 vehicles in late August 1989. Last year's
late-August rate was the strongest 10-day period of 1989,
because consumers rushed to buy before new-model price hikes
took effect. Also, some rebates had already begun spreading
to the new 1990 models.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
are trying the same tactic this year -- putting rebates on
most new 1991 models even before they appear in showrooms.
But so far, sales haven't responded.
   "People are only buying cars when they really need them,"
said auto analyst Charles J. Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in
New York. Buying for less-urgent purposes is drying up, he
added.
   A recent survey of consumer confidence seems to support
that contention. The University of Michigan's Consumer
Confidence Index fell to 83.8 in August from 101.7 in July.
That's a bigger drop than occurred after the 1987 stock
market crash.
   John Grettenberger, general manager of GM's Cadillac
division, said uncertainty over the economy's health and
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is clouding the division's outlook
for the fall.
   "We need good stable Wall Street performance and more good
news from the Middle East to see demand restored," he said at
a news conference to unveil Cadillac's 1991 model lineup. Mr.
Grettenberger said the division has hastily redone a series
of television commercials for those new models to include a
reference to the new models' improved fuel economy on the
highway. One line from the new ads: "It's as responsible to
own as it is responsive to drive."
   The August news was dim for GM, Chrysler and Ford. GM,
which has been posting slight monthly gains in car-market
share in 1990 after years of decline, saw its August share
drop to below 32% from an already-low 32.4% last year.
   Ford's car-market share dropped to 20% in August from 22%
a year earlier, continuing a year-long trend of lower share
for the No. 2 producer. Chrysler also dropped significantly,
garnering 8.3% of the U.S. car market, down from 10% a year
earlier.
   In contrast, Toyota Motor Corp.'s share surged to 12% of
U.S. car sales in August, up from only 9% a year earlier.
Toyota was helped by big factory-to-dealer rebates, including
amounts of up to $1,200 on Camrys and up to $1,000 on
Corollas and Tercels.
   Toyota sold nearly 97,000 cars in August, far more than
Chrysler, which sold just over 66,000. And while Chrysler's
strength is in trucks, especially Jeeps and minivans,
Toyota's total sales of 119,000 cars and trucks combined
nearly equaled Chrysler's total sales of 124,500 vehicles.
   Another Japanese winner was Honda Motor Co., which grabbed
10% of the car market in August, up from 8% a year earlier.
Nissan Motor Co.'s share declined slightly to 5%, following a
year-long pattern, but Mazda Motor Co. posted a slight gain.
   Truck sales by the Big Three held up better, in general,
than did the vehicle market as a whole. Ford's truck sales
fell 7.1% in August, a modest decline. Ford's new Jeep-like
vehicle, the Explorer, has been a big success with consumers.
GM's truck sales declined 16% in August. Chrysler's truck
sales dropped almost 23% in the month, more than the market
as a whole. Sales of the company's Jeep Cherokee have been
hurt by Ford's Explorer.
