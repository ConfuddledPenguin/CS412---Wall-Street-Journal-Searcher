   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- The former president of a Teledyne
Inc. division pleaded guilty to one count of making false
statements to the Defense Department in connection with an
alleged scheme to defraud the Navy on a helicopter contract.
   The ex-president of Teledyne Hydra-Power, 69-year-old
Cirino Giampapa of Massapequa, N.Y., entered the plea in U.S.
District Court here. Also, Morton Baine, 54, of New Rochelle,
N.Y., a former Teledyne Hydra-Power controller, pleaded
guilty to conspiring with others at the division to defraud
the U.S. and to submit false claims to the Defense
Department.

   The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan said the alleged
scheme involved the submission of fraudulent labor-hour
figures to inflate the prices Teledyne Hydra-Power charged
for parts. The government said the false claims totaled more
than $4.5 million.
   Teledyne Hydra-Power is a division of Los Angeles-based
Teledyne Inc., which has diverse manufacturing interests. In
November, Teledyne Inc. agreed to pay the U.S. $11.9 million
to cover the overcharges and penalties.
   Mr. Giampapa, who will be sentenced Nov. 14, faces a
possible fine of as much as $10,000 and a maximum prison
sentence of five years. Mr. Baine, whose sentencing is
scheduled for Nov. 8, faces a fine of as much as $250,000 and
five years in prison.
   Carl Bernstein, attorney for Mr. Baine, declined comment.
Walter Bonner, Mr. Giampapa's attorney, couldn't be reached.
