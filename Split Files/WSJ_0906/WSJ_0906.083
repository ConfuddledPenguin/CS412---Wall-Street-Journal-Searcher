   Lukens Inc. said it should have "record results" for
fiscal 1990, compared with last year's net income of $41.5
million, or $4.73 a share.
   Speaking to security analysts, W.R. Wilson, Lukens
chairman and chief executive officer, said the company
intends to find more export markets for its specialty plate
steels.

   Mr. Wilson suggested that acquisitions are part of the
growth plan. The "ideal candidate" for acquisition is a
company that would generate $225 million in sales and
operating margins of 11% or more, he said.
   Lukens officials said that representatives of the United
Steelworkers of America union have agreed to meet next week
to discuss a new contract. The union's contract doesn't
expire for another year, but the Coatesville, Pa.-based
company has asked the workers to open talks early.
