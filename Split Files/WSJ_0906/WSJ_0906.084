   Thus spake a fictional government antitrust lawyer in the
satirical free-market poem "The Incredible Bread Machine."
The folks who work for the major oil companies can be
forgiven if they think that they too will land in trouble no
matter what they do in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Oil companies have been under pressure from the White
House on down to restrain price hikes. As it is now, most of
the price increases out there would still leave the companies
well below the replacement cost of the new oil they must buy.
Now, however, independent gasoline wholesalers are demanding
the government go after the majors for "predatory" pricing
and an alleged attempt to drive the independents out of
business.
   The independents charge that the retail price of gas
charged at some stations owned by the big oil companies is
less than the wholesale price independent stations are
charged. The oil companies say they can most effectively hold
down retail prices at stations they control directly, if
indeed "holding down" prices is what's expected of them.
Until recently, the Atlantic Richfield Co. was charging 10
cents a gallon less than other stations because most of the
oil it markets is its own. In any event, it finally had to
put its prices back up when its lower pump prices caused huge
lines and caused it to run out of supplies in some areas.
   But Missouri Attorney General William Webster scents a
conspiracy. He recently called for a probe into the "illegal,
predatory pricing practices" of some oil companies. In an
example of cognitive dissonance, Mr. Webster was at the same
time in Washington with 24 other AGs -- sometimes called the
Aspiring Governors -- to demand that President Bush punish
any oil companies that engage in "price gouging."
   The independent wholesalers and dealers want a federal law
to bar oil companies from owning gasoline stations. They
probably won't get it, but the fact that the issue has been
picked up at all is further proof that few subjects are more
susceptible to demagoguery than the workings of energy
markets. Thus, we now have the spectacle of several
"pro-consumer" Members of Congress defending those gasoline
stations that in fact have raised prices to consumers the
most.
