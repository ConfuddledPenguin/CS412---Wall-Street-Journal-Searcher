   After reading Jerry Della Femina's irrational and
emotional diatribe against Catholicism and Judge David Souter
("Souter Nomination Shows Pogo Was Right," editorial page,
Aug. 14), I added him and his children to the list of those
for whom I pray daily. I will pray for the re-conversion of
Mr. Della Femina to the Catholicism he left 40 years ago. I
will pray that his four-year-old daughter develops a deep
reverence for life so that she will never even consider
killing her unborn child. I will pray that his 15-month-old
son develops an abhorrence toward perversion so that he will
resist the temptations of homosexuality. Cognizant of the
rebelliousness of children against their parents' moral
values (or lack thereof), I am confident that at least two of
my prayers may be answered.

   Having finished reading Mr. Della Femina's article, I
discovered my mistake; but halfway through it I had decided
he was pro-life.
   He wrote, "If the future freedom of our children is not a
litmus test of a Supreme Court Justice, what is?" Well, Mr.
Della Femina, what future is there for the baby who has been
aborted?

   I'm sorry I don't have an advertising budget to send Mr.
Della Femina's way, but I extend my thanks for enunciating
feelings I've had for a long time. Where did my familiar GOP
pick up this authoritarian streak? I've always felt the
least-intrusive government worked best, whether business
relationships, the courts or our private lives were involved.
To Messrs. Bush, Souter, et al., I say, "Get outta my face."

   It's very apparent to me that Mr. Della Femina hasn't the
foggiest idea what the duty of a Supreme Court justice is. It
is to interpret law. Not to make it]
   It doesn't matter what he looks like, where he lives, his
marital status, or his opinion on abortion for that matter.
If he's a good judge he will put his personal opinions aside
and interpret law.
