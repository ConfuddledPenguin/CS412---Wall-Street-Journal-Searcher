   NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. outlined plans that virtually
would dismantle its struggling Philipp Brothers unit.
   Salomon said it will fold parts of Philipp Brothers into
other subsidiaries as part of a "major downsizing and
repositioning" of the commodity unit, which has been
unprofitable for six consecutive quarters. Other Philipp
departments will be sold.

   The announcement marks a full circle for Philipp Brothers:
Initially, it was part of Phibro Corp., which acquired
Salomon Brothers in 1981. Philipp Brothers has had a pretax
loss of $83 million so far this year, tarnishing what
otherwise have been impressive earnings at Salomon's
securities and energy segments.
   In a news release, Salomon said Philipp's precious-metal
trading group will be absorbed by its Salomon Brothers Inc.
securities unit. Fertilizers and countertrade departments
will be folded into Phibro Energy, Salomon's big oil trading
and refining subsidiary.
   Meantime, Salomon is negotiating to sell Philipp's
nonferrous-metal department, a group that includes trading in
copper, aluminum, nickel, tin and zinc. Salomon blamed this
year's first-quarter pretax loss of $62 million for Philipp
on unspecified trades in nonferrous metals.
   Cocoa trading will continue to be conducted within Philipp
Brothers, Salomon said, although cocoa operations will be at
Phibro Energy. Phillip Brothers has cut back sharply from the
approximately 150 commodities it traded at the time of the
Phibro-Salomon merger to a handful.
   Salomon has said it will take a pretax charge of as much
as $200 million, expected in this quarter, to shrink the
ailing unit.
