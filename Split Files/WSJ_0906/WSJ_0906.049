   Children exposed to heavy amounts of tobacco smoke at home
are more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer later in
life than those who grow up in smoke-free households, a new
study says.
   The finding adds to the growing body of evidence that
nonsmokers' health may be damaged by other people's smoke. It
is one of the first studies to find that parents who smoke
present a potential cancer risk to their children.

   "It may be particularly important to protect children and
adolescents from this environmental hazard," say the authors
of the report, published in today's edition of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   But the report found no statistically significant link
between lung cancer among nonsmokers and spouses who smoke,
or environmental smoke from the workplace or social settings
such as restaurants -- a development a representative of the
tobacco industry considered encouraging.
   The report "is in agreement with what we've been saying
{about} environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace, the
home and social settings for adults," said Steve Parrish,
vice president, corporate scientific affairs, at Philip
Morris Cos., New York. He also played down the significance
of the conclusion about the impact on children, saying
several other studies didn't turn up any evidence of
increased cancer risk.
   Mr. Parrish said the report supports the industry's
position that there isn't any justification for banning use
of tobacco in the workplace.
   The study's findings were based on interviews with 191
nonsmokers recently diagnosed with lung cancer in 23 counties
in New York State as well as 191 nonsmoking control subjects,
matched by age, sex and county of residence.
   The researchers, led by Dwight T. Janerich, an
epidemiologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, New
Haven, Conn., focused on exposure to tobacco smoke in the
household, although they also queried participants about
workplace and social setting exposures.
   Why children would be vulnerable to cancer is a question
for further study, Dr. Janerich said, but he speculated that
their lungs could be more suspectible to damage from smoke
than those of adults or that a long latency period is
required for the cancer to develop. The average age of cancer
patients in the study was about 67. Dr. Janerich disputed
that the report undermined previous research showing a 38%
increased risk of lung cancer for nonsmokers living with
smoking spouses. He also said non-household data wasn't
sufficiently firm to reach definitive conclusions.
   The study estimated that 17% of lung cancer among
nonsmokers "can be attributed to high levels of exposure to
cigarette smoke" at home when they were under 21 years old.
The scientists defined high levels as at least 25
"smoker-years" of exposure -- a calculation based on the
number of years a person lived in a residence multiplied by
the number of people in the household who smoked.
   The researchers acknowledged that the findings could have
been affected by the differences in the ability of
participants to recall details of lifetime tobacco exposure.
