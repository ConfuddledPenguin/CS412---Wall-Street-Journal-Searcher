   NEW YORK -- Judging by the financial woes of many Wall
Street brokerage firms, it would seem that the last thing
this town needs is more stockbrokers.
   Which is why the Street is starting to wonder: Just what
does Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. think it's up to?

   The relatively small, Baltimore securities firm says it
plans to nearly double its New York City presence, partly by
picking off high-profile producers from Wall Street's
stumbling giants. And Alex. Brown has shown it meant business
recently by luring two of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s top
revenue-producing brokers -- including one of the top 10 from
Shearson's nationwide army of 9,500 -- to its Big Apple
branch.
   The Alex. Brown push is another sign of how the generally
smaller, "regional" brokerage firms based outside New York
are profiting from the woes of big Wall Street firms as the
industry retrenches from its expansion of the 1980s. In this
case, the out-of-towners are setting up shop right in the
front yard of Shearson, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. and the other behemoths.
   "It's not something brand new. But we have a new {branch}
manager and we're getting more aggressive about it," says
A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard, Alex. Brown chief operating officer.
   Mr. Krongard adds: "It has nothing to do with the `cachet'
of being in New York. We don't feel deprived that we're not
{based} in New York and instead in Baltimore."
   The actual number of brokers involved in the Alex. Brown
push isn't large -- the firm plans to increase its New York
City sales force over the next few years to about 50 from 30
currently. But the commission revenues involved could be
significant because Alex. Brown brokers focus on the
wealthiest investors.
   Not every regional firm agrees that the "I Love New York"
strategy is worth it. Traditionally, the regionals have stuck
to their home ports and a select number of neighboring
states, shunning New York City and its high rents. Some think
that's still the best way.
   "It's not our style," says Benjamin Edwards III, chairman
of A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis, the largest U.S. brokerage
firm based outside New York, which used to have five A.G.
Edward &amp; Sons branches in the Big Apple but has none now. "We
like more-humble costs."
   Consider this: Mr. Edwards's fast-growing firm has added
28 new branches from Florida to California since March 1. But
that includes only four in New York state and none in the
city, with the rest in such locales as Lake Mary, Fla.;
Hilton Head Island in South Carolina; and Nacogdoches, Texas.
(A.G. Edwards does have a small New York City trading
operation.)
   Even some regionals who have New York City brokers aren't
interested in stepping up their activity here.
   James Brinkley, president of Legg Mason Inc.'s Legg Mason
Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore, says his firm is content
having its one New York City office. As for expansion, Legg
Mason would rather concentrate on other cities, for example
by opening its fifth Philadelphia branch.
   "We can just make a greater impact in a market like
Philadelphia. It would take an incredible amount of brokers
and money to make a greater impact in New York," says Mr.
Brinkley. "There are so many major firms with their home
office there."
   The Alex. Brown brokerage push comes at a time when its
reputation as a high-quality underwriter of stock offerings
has been tarnished. This summer two clients -- In-Store
Advertising Inc. and Bizmart Inc. -- stunned investors with
poor earnings outlooks, and both companies' newly issued
shares plummeted. "It may just be the law of averages gone
awry," Alex. Brown's Mr. Krongard says.
   As Alex. Brown sees it, there's no need to hire hundreds
of brokers in New York City to have an impact on the
brokerage side. Instead, Alex. Brown thinks it can profit by
snatching up enough high-producing brokers who are
disenchanted with their big firms. (Last year, Alex. Brown
says, it hired 55 "experienced" brokers, adding to 18 of its
20 branches.)
   The defections of the two top Shearson brokers -- Mark
Fisher, 31 years old, and Mark Branigan, 38 -- mean that
millions of dollars of trading commissions from their
multimillionaire clients could leave Shearson and resurface
at Alex. Brown. In interviews, the two brokers say that most
of their clients have already transferred, despite what their
boss described as "rather zealous" efforts by Shearson to
keep the accounts.
   Shearson, an American Express Co. unit that like Merrill
has been retrenching and laying off thousands, says it leads
the major nationwide brokerage firms in broker productivity,
with $235,000 in revenues per broker last year. But Messrs.
Fisher and Branigan aren't average brokers; they produced
more than $2 million apiece in commissions at Shearson last
year, they say.
   A Shearson spokesman confirmed the two brokers had
resigned but declined to comment further on their move.
   The man who wooed Messrs. Fisher and Branigan to Alex.
Brown was Robert Oram, 41-year-old manager of the New York
branch who himself just joined the firm from New York-based
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Mr. Oram said no recruiting bonuses were paid to the two
brokers. But they apparently were treated like kings; among
other things, he says Alex. Brown's president and other top
officers hosted them at the home office in Baltimore. "At the
moment we have no plans for raiding Shearson, so to speak,"
he says. "But we're actively recruiting those brokers who'll
really fit into Alex. Brown."
   Messrs. Fisher and Branigan suggested that Alex. Brown was
more focused than their former employer. Mr. Branigan says
Shearson is "a big firm," in contrast to Alex. Brown, which
is more like the tight-knit Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.
securities firm where he once worked. (Lehman was acquired by
Shearson in 1984.)
   "We just felt that to take our careers to the next step,
this is the right place to do it," says Mr. Fisher.
   Meanwhile, Alex. Brown's stock rose 87.5 cents to $10
yesterday on the national over-the-counter market. Volume was
344,800 shares, more than three times the recent daily
average. Alex. Brown says it knows of no reason for the
stock's spurt. "The stock was probably oversold versus the
industry group," says Beverly Wright, chief financial
officer.
