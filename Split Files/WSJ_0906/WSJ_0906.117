   Xerox Corp. said it introduced two small convenience
copiers, increasing to nine the number of small copiers it
sells.
   The Stamford, Conn., company said the 5034 model is the
first 50 Series small copier equipped with an automatic
document handler that can invert originals to make copies on
both sides of a piece of paper. The copier, with a list price
of $9,100, will be sold through Xerox's own sales force.

   The other new copier, the 5011 R/E, can process 12 copies
a minute, accept originals as big as 11 inches by 17 inches,
and reduce or enlarge in ratios of 65%, 75% and 130% of the
original, Xerox said. It will retail for $2,895.
   Xerox also said it is initiating a "total satisfaction
guarantee" program for its products. Under the program,
customers who maintain their Xerox equipment under Xerox
authorized service or warranty can get a replacement if they
are dissatisfied with the equipment. The program covers all
Xerox products for three years.
