   Investors pulled more than $2 billion out of money-market
mutual funds in the latest week as taxable yields continued
to slide.
   Assets of the 433 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report dropped $2.1 billion, to $398.8 billion,
the Holliston, Mass., newsletter reported. The average
seven-day compound yield, which assumes reinvestment of
dividends, slipped to 7.75% from 7.76% in the week ended
Tuesday.

   Some of the cash coming out of money funds may have gone
into two-year Treasury notes purchased at last week's
auction, said Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's. Also,
she said, some investors "may be getting their feet wet in
the stock and bond markets again."
   Money-fund portfolio managers lengthened the average
maturity of taxable funds' investments to 46 days, the
longest since August 1987, indicating that they expect
short-term interest rates to decline and want to hold onto
current yields for a longer period. The funds invest in such
things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.
Average maturity had been 45 days for four consecutive weeks.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
fell to 7.47% from 7.48%. The average 30-day simple yield
slipped to 7.49% from 7.50% and the average 30-day compound
yield eased to 7.77% from 7.78%.
   Assets of 230 tax-free funds fell $811.5 million, to $79.9
billion, Donoghue's reported, while the average seven-day
compound yield rose to 5.43% from 5.34%. The latest yield is
equal to a taxable yield of 7.54% for an investor in the 28%
tax bracket and 8.10% for someone paying 33% in taxes.
   The average maturity of the tax-exempt funds lengthened by
two days, to 59 days, indicating that those portfolio
managers, too, expect rates to decline.
