   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Pier 1 Imports Inc. said it expects
to report net for the second-quarter ended Sept. 1, fell at
least 60% to seven cents or eight cents a share, from 20
cents in the year-earlier period.
   Moreover, Pier 1 expects earnings for the fiscal second
half ending March 2, 1991, to drop to between 25 cents and 30
cents a share, from 32 cents in the year-earlier period,
Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer, said
in an interview. That would result in year-end earnings of
between 54 cents and 60 cents a share, down from 71 cents the
year earlier.

   The company also announced an expansion of its stock
buy-back program, to four million shares from two million.
   For the first quarter ended June 2, Pier 1 reported record
earnings of $7.7 million, or 22 cents a share, on record
sales of $138 million. But since then, Mr. Johnson said, the
national economy has slowed, and buyers have become cautious,
especially in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. In
August, sales at Pier 1 stores open more than a year fell 7%
or 8%, Mr. Johnson said. In July, sales at stores open more
than a year were about flat, and in June they fell 2.6%.
   The specialty home-furnishings retailer has been hurt in
particular by sluggish sales of new and existing homes, said
Mr. Johnson. Most affected of the 535 Pier 1 stores in the
U.S. have been those in California and the Northeast, he
said.
   Dennis Telzrow, a retail analyst with Eppler Guerin &amp;
Turner, said "I originally forecast 78 cents a share" for
Pier 1 this fiscal year. As it has turned out, however, "the
furniture industry as a whole has been poor, and some Pier 1
merchandise is higher priced" than mass-merchandise
furniture, making it all the more vulnerable to the downturn,
he said.
   Concerning the buy-back program, Mr. Johnson noted that
since last December, when the board approved the purchase of
two million shares, Pier 1 common has fallen from about $12 a
share to below $8 a share. "Down at this level, we think it's
even a better investment, so we expanded it to four million,"
said Mr. Johnson. Four million shares represent more than 10%
of Pier 1's approximate 36 million shares outstanding. Of the
four million shares authorized for buy-back, the company has
bought about 700,000.
