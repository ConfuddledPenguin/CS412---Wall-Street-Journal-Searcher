   About one-thirty, maybe two,
   A nap is what I wish to do;
   I feel like I've been hit, post-luncheon,
   By someone with an ax or truncheon.
   The world can go downhill on skids
   As long as I can close my lids.
   Revile me as a lout and loafa --
   But go away. I want my sofa]

   Bankers in highly leveraged deals
   Have an enviable position of power,
   In getting big fees when they're put together,
   And again when they start going sour.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.
