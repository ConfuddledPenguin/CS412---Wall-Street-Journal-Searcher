   Tucson Electric Power Co. filed suit against SCEcorp and
its Southern California Edison Co. unit for alleged wrongful
and negligent interference with the Arizona utility's 1988
merger agreement with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.
   In a suit filed yesterday in state court in San Diego,
Tucson Electric charged SCEcorp with "willful, wanton,
reckless and conscious disregard of the rights and interests
of Tucson Electric" when, among other things, SCEcorp
successfully proposed that it acquire San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric.

   San Diego Gas and SCEcorp hope to complete their $2.56
billion merger in the first half of next year, subject to
approvals by state and federal agencies. Shareholders of both
companies approved the merger in April 1989.
   Tucson Electric said in its suit that it has suffered a
loss of "substantial economic benefits" because of its failed
merger agreement. In particular, Tucson Electric has surplus
electricity that it had hoped would be sold by San Diego Gas.
The suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
   "The suit is totally groundless and without merit," said a
spokesman for SCEcorp and Southern California Edison in
Rosemead, Calif. He said the Tucson Electric-San Diego Gas
merger agreement allowed both companies to receive and act
upon competing merger offers. San Diego Gas and SCEcorp acted
in full compliance with the terms of the agreement, he said.
   A spokesman for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which isn't
named as a defendant, declined to comment on the suit.
