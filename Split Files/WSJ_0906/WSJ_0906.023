   ANKENY, Iowa -- Casey's General Stores Inc., a convenience
store chain, said its board approved the purchase of as many
as one million, or 8.8%, of its approximately 11.4 million
common shares outstanding, in open-market or privately
negotiated transactions from time to time, depending on
market conditions.
   Casey's said it will finance the buy-backs with cash from
its working capital.
