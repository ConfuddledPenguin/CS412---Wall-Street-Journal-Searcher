   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices declined despite
production problems in Chile and Peru.
   The most actively traded December contract ended with a
loss of 1.55 cents a pound at $1.2220.

   The market declined despite developments that would
normally strengthen prices. In Chile, Codelco, the
state-owned mining company, said that an explosion occurred
in El Teniente, its second-largest mine.
   The accident killed one employee and injured two others,
but it isn't expected to curtail its production, according to
a company announcement. One analyst said the explosion was in
a part of the mine that had been closed off.
   However, another analyst noted that the mine has had at
least three explosions this year, following two last year,
and that there had been concern recently in Chile about
recurring blasts. Chile is the world's largest copper
producer.
   In Peru, Southern Peru Copper Corp. yesterday declared
force majeure on September shipments of refined copper,
effective immediately. The action was in response to a force
majeure on cathode shipments to Southern Peru from Mineroperu
Inc., which has been on strike since Aug. 17, a company
spokesman said. Force majeure is a condition that permits a
company to depart from the strict terms of a contract because
of events beyond its control. An estimated 10,000 tons of
copper production has been lost during the 20 days of the
Mineroperu strike, an analyst said.
   Fred Demler, metals economist for PaineWebber, observed
that the copper industry is in a divergent trend. "In the
U.S., buying of copper has softened, inventories have
increased, and the stock market is reflecting a weakening
economy," he said.
   "Outside the U.S., production problems continue to prevail
and demand in Japan and West Germany has remained steady,
despite a recent slowing in demand from Japan and some
selling of copper by West German merchants on the London
Metal Exchange," he added.
   World-wide, Mr. Demler said, copper inventories have
increased by 85,000 tons to 640,000 tons since the end of the
first quarter, mostly in the U.S. and in warehouses of the
London Metal Exchange.
   Fred D'Agostino, president of Metals Resources Inc., a
metals trading company in Riverside, Conn., said that trading
interest has slowed in futures and demand for physical copper
has dropped significantly -- including "domestically and for
export, for refined and scrap copper."
   But even with this slowdown, Mr. D'Agostino also noted,
there is a wide disparity between the small amount of copper
in Commodity Exchange warehouses for delivery against futures
and the open interest in the September contract. Open
interest is the number of outstanding contracts that remain
to be nullified by an opposite trade or satisfied by delivery
of the commodity.
   At the moment, he noted, there is a total of 8,900 tons of
copper in Comex warehouses, compared with a September open
interest that is equal to 107,500 tons. Notices to deliver
copper against the September contract began to be issued
Friday.
   "This is a type of situation that has repeatedly taken
place over the past three years, and while it has eventually
worked itself out most of the time, it still has the
potential to cause concern," Mr. D'Agostino said.
   Ron Shorr, analyst for Bear Stearns, said that despite the
force majeure called in Peru, the Mineroperu situation is
reported to be near a settlement, which would be a negative
for prices.
   Also, he noted, the Escondida mine is expected to come
onstream later this year in Chile, with a capacity of about
320,000 tons, which would significantly add to the world
copper supply.

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and silver futures prices rose, but
platinum futures fell. December delivery gold was up $2.50 an
ounce to $393.00. December silver advanced 1.2 cents an ounce
to $4.8370. October platinum declined $2.20 an ounce to
$484.20. Gold prices rallied on a new round of belligerent
statements by Iraq's president Saddam Hussein, but then fell
back, analysts said. The Iraqi president didn't say anything
new, one analyst said, but the comments tended to dispel the
hopeful aura of a possible political settlement of the
Persian Gulf crisis and renewed belief in a potential
military confrontation. Another analyst commented that gold
hasn't been behaving too well in the face of a sharp rally in
oil, a drop in the dollar and the possibility of lower
interest rates, all of which are usually favorable for gold.
A lack of demand for bullion from Switzerland and West
Germany has been a factor restricting a rise in the gold
price, he said. "At the moment December gold is in a trading
range of between $386 and $399, and if there is a breakout on
either side of that range, prices could show a significant
rise or fall," he said.

   COFFEE: Futures prices rose. The December contract, after
declining and testing the $1-a-pound level, recovered to end
with a gain of 2.50 cents at $1.0370 a pound. Sandra Kaul,
analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers, attributed the firmness
to concern over availability of finer types of coffee, such
as those from Colombia and Central America and higher quality
Brazilian beans. Colombia and Central America won't begin
harvesting their crops for another month to six weeks, Ms.
Kaul noted, and the Brazilian harvest, which is about
three-quarters complete, is yielding far less than expected.
At the same time, U.S. roasters have begun to process coffee
for the peak winter consumption period and have sharply
stepped up their operations, she said.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Futures prices showed modest gains.
Wheat futures rebounded on a "technical rally" after
Tuesday's sharp sell-off, traders and analysts said. Wheat
futures prices plunged Tuesday on news that U.S. exporters
were losing business to Canada and European Community
countries. Yesterday wheat futures for September delivery on
the Chicago Board of Trade gained 6.75 cents a bushel to
close at $2.63 a bushel. Wheat prices also gained support
from rumors that the bread shortage in the Soviet Union,
combined with the prospect of a significant portion of that
country's harvest rotting in the fields, could lead to
emergency approval for wheat exports to the Soviets. Soybean
futures prices advanced on continued concerns about dry
conditions in the Mississippi River delta region and the
Southeastern U.S. Concerns about an early frost in extreme
northern sections of the Midwest next week that could reduce
crop yields also supported futures prices. November soybeans
gained 2.25 cents a bushel to close at $6.2650 a bushel. Corn
futures prices also advanced, with the December contract
gaining 1.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.36 a bushel.
