   FORT WORTH, Texas -- A group of dissident shareholders of
Justin Industries Inc. charged that the company's board
violated federal securities laws by taking too long to
disclose that it had amended Justin's bylaws to make it more
difficult to remove directors.
   The dissident group, which is headed by Perry H.
Sutherland of Kansas City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of
New York, filed a motion in federal court here seeking
permission to file new allegations in its legal battle with
Justin, a maker of boots, building materials and industrial
equipment.

   The group's charges center on Justin's disclosure that its
board voted to raise the number of shareholders' votes needed
to remove directors to 75% of total shares outstanding from
50%. Although the amendment passed in November 1989, the
company failed to make the change public until last month,
the dissidents charged.
   The group, which owns 12% of Justin's common, earlier
offered to pay $18.50 a share, or $140.5 million, for the
shares it didn't own. Justin rebuffed the offer and announced
a plan to acquire Tony Lama Co., an El Paso, Texas, boot
maker.
   According to the proposed charges, the changes would make
it impossible for shareholders to oust directors because
management controls at least 25% of the shares. "Shareholder
democracy is a dead letter at Justin," the filing states.
   The group is seeking to file the allegations as part of
its response to a lawsuit filed against it by Justin charging
it with failing to disclose adequately its intentions to
acquire the company.
   The group is seeking, among other things, for the court to
declare that the proxies obtained by Justin in the March
annual meeting were "ineffective" and that the election of
directors was void; to enjoin the directors from proceeding
with its planned acquisition of Tony Lama; and to order the
company and its directors to pay actual and punitive damages.
   A Justin official didn't return phone calls seeking
comment.
