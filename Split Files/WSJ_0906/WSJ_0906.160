   New York state regulators released documents that a Nynex
Corp. unit had labeled "trade secret information" and fought
to keep out of public view.
   The documents, which came to light as part of a $1.4
billion rate case in New York state, also include a list of
nine Nynex employees who attended the bawdy gatherings in
Florida, nicknamed "pervert conventions" by participants.

   The gatherings began before the Bell System breakup as
private parties, but they evolved into organized gatherings
of 40 or 50 attendees -- complete with guest lists and
rooming assignments. All but a few attendees were either
employees of Nynex -- mostly managers in its Materiel
Enterprises unit -- or employees of suppliers, a combination
that raised serious conflict-of-interest concerns.
   Here are samples of what the Nynex unit had deemed "trade
secrets":
   -- A Feb. 9, 1987, letter from Larry "Shark" Friedman,
organizer of the conventions, to fellow "pervert club"
members, in which he sings the praises of the gatherings. The
letter notes that he has collected 100 slides and a one-hour
videotape of activities at the 1987 convention.
   -- A March 23, 1988, letter from Mr. Friedman announcing
the winner of the "Most Valuable Pervert" award at that
year's convention.
   -- A transcript of a New York Telephone security interview
with a person with information on the "pervert club." The
security official acknowledges that people involved in a
1985-1986 company investigation of Mr. Friedman and the
Florida activities were "given a clean bill of health, so to
speak, even though we know what was going on and is going
on." At one point, the informant tells about a "pervert club"
member having sex in public with a prostitute.
   "It is clear now that the assertion we have made all along
-- that New York Telephone abused the trade secret
designation -- is absolutely correct," said New York Attorney
General Robert Abrams. He pointed out that a number of
documents are still under the gag order, and said the public
should have access to these as well. The company, he said,
has used the trade secret designation to keep from disclosing
information that is merely embarrassing.
   "We have no desire to personally embarrass any
individuals," Mr. Abrams said. "But we are concerned about
misuse of the trade secret designation." The attorney
general's office is a party in the rate case, and has
contended that the conventions led to cozy deals between
Materiel Enterprises and suppliers who attended.
   A spokesman for Nynex said the information that was
released came to light as part of the company's own
investigation. It supports the company's swift decision to
dismiss and discipline employees who were involved in the
Florida gatherings. After receiving information from
anonymous callers, Nynex launched an investigation in the
summer of 1988. That investigation led to the dismissals of
Mr. Friedman, who had been vice president for purchasing at
the Materiel Enterprises unit, and John Marino, a unit
purchasing manager who helped organize the conventions.
   Mr. Friedman wasn't available for comment.
   New York regulators also released a list of 33 companies
that were represented at the conventions. The list includes a
number of large companies such as Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard,
Rockwell International, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing
Corp., and Southern Bell, a unit of BellSouth Corp. It also
includes Anixter, General Cable, Raychem Corp., Seiscor
Corp., and temporary-help agencies such as Olsten Corp. and
Butler Telecommunications.
