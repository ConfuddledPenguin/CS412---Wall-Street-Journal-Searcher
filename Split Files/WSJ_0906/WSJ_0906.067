   The $30 billion in human and technical intelligence bought
by the U.S. government each year proved worthless at the
start of August. Or so it now appears. The surge of Iraqi
troops and tanks into Kuwait early on Aug. 2 wrong-footed at
least three governments, if one goes by the behavior of their
employees. At least one very senior U.S. defense official was
calmly driving off for vacation. The British ambassador to
Iraq, Harold "Hooky" Walker, was on holiday in Woking. The
chief of Israeli military intelligence was enjoying his own
wedding party.
   This nonchalant posture becomes all the more incredible in
light of the menacing tempo of events in the preceding three
months. In May Saddam Hussein was announcing loudly that his
patience was almost exhausted. The war against Iran, financed
largely by the Gulf states to shield themselves from the
ayatollah, had bled Iraq dry. Kuwait's and Abu Dhabi's
flouting of OPEC production guidelines was keeping oil prices
at rock bottom and denying Iraq desperately needed revenues.

   Even if the West didn't get the message, or chose not to
listen to it, Kuwait's ruling family certainly did. By May
brokers in the Asian markets were beginning to notice
substantial selling by the London-based Kuwait Investment
Office, which manages Kuwait's $100 billion portfolio. By
late July, as the Far Eastern Economic Review later described
it, Kuwait was getting out of its Asian stocks and into cash
with as much speed as prudence would permit, given that a
hasty fire sale could have brought several Asian markets
crashing down, so vast were KIO's holdings.
   Even if the U.S. did not care to notice the Asian markets,
it surely had contacts inside Kuwait's ruling family. On July
18 Kuwait's cabinet sat down to consider the mounting crisis.
London's Financial Times later acquired the minutes. Were
they unavailable to the U.S. ambassador?
   First to speak was Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's
finance minister: "Iraq is going to continue escalating the
level of confrontation."
   Next spoke Kuwait's interior minister, Sheikh Salem
al-Sabah. He too was uneasy. Iraq, he advised, might well
have profited from the political turmoil in June, when
Kuwait's emir had refused to restore the Parliament he
suspended in 1986, permitting only an interim assembly.
   "There is a possibility of Iraqi aggression," said Sheikh
Sabah al Ahmad al-Sabah, the foreign minister. Dhari
al-Othman, the justice minister, concurred. "The Iraqi
memorandum {which demanded compensation for $2.4 billion in
oil `stolen' from the Rumaila field} is just the beginning.
God knows how far they will go."
   Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, the crown prince and
prime minister, put it clearly: "The Iraqis could take
military measures." He urged Kuwait's military and security
forces to be on the alert.
   Kuwait's increasingly desperate maneuvers culminated at
the Jidda mediation talks on Aug. 1, the day before the
invasion. Sheikh Sabah, the foreign minister, later told
Egypt's al-Mussawar magazine that in Jidda Kuwait agreed to
write off Iraq's $15 billion war debt and to lease Warbah
island to Iraq as an oil outlet for the Rumaila field.
   These were major concessions, but only a few hours later
Saddam gave the order to march.
   What were Saddam's intelligence chief and ambassadors
telling him about the U.S. government, even as it headed for
the beaches of August? The question surely gnawed at the
Iraqi president as he paced his command bunker. It was the
billion-dollar question. All through the '80s the U.S. had
appeased him, armed him, given him the green light to invade
Iran. If he grabbed Kuwait, what would it do now?
   Two days earlier, on July 31, John Kelly, assistant
secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs,
walked into the Rayburn building to testify before the Middle
East subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   After Mr. Kelly's formal statement, Chairman Lee Hamilton
(D., Ind.) began to press him. Mr. Hamilton had read "an
indirect quotation in the press that Secretary {of Defense
Richard} Cheney said that the United States' commitment was
to come to Kuwaiti -- to Kuwait's defense if it is attacked."
Was that statement accurate? Mr. Hamilton wondered. Could Mr.
Kelly please clarify?
   The following exchange may have launched a war and changed
the face of the Middle East forever:
   Mr. Kelly: "I'm happy to, Mr. Chairman. I'm not familiar
with the quotation that you just referred to, but I am
confident in the administration's position on the issue. We
have no defense treaty relationship with any Gulf country.
That is clear. We support the security and independence of
friendly states in the region. Ever since the Truman
administration we've maintained naval forces in the Gulf
because of our interest in stability in that region. We are
calling for a peaceful resolution of any differences in that
area and we hope, and trust, and believe that the sovereignty
of every state in the Gulf ought to be respected."
   Rep. Hamilton: "Now, do we have a commitment to our
friends in the Gulf, in the event that they are engaged in
oil or territorial disputes with their neighbors?"
   Mr. Kelly: "As I said, Mr. Chairman, we have no defense
treaty relationships with any of the countries. We have
historically avoided taking a position on border disputes or
on internal OPEC deliberations, but we have certainly, as
have all administrations, resoundingly called for the
peaceful settlement of disputes and differences in the area."
   Rep. Hamilton: "If there -- if Iraq, for example, charged
across the border into Kuwait and -- for whatever reason --
what would be our position with regard to the use of U.S.
forces?"
   Mr. Kelly: "That, Mr. Chairman, is a hypothetical or a
contingency question, the kind of which I can't get into.
Suffice it to say we would be extremely concerned, but I
cannot get into the realm of `what if' answers."
   Rep. Hamilton: "In that circumstance, it is correct to
say, however, that we do not have a treaty commitment which
would obligate us to engage U.S. forces there?"
   Mr. Kelly: "That is correct."
   This exchange did not go unnoticed. The next day, the
Financial Times's Washington correspondent was reporting to
his London office apropos the Gulf crisis "the one striking
public statement, that the U.S. has no defensive treaties
with Kuwait or any of its neighbors."
   More to the point, Mr. Kelly's testimony was reported on
the BBC's World Service. For Saddam, in those final fateful
hours, it was surely the decisive sign. The U.S. might fume
and fret after the event, but it would do nothing.
   In the wake of Pearl Harbor, Republicans charged President
Roosevelt with luring the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor.
Today, in the wake of Iraq's attack, Democrats could as
soundly charge that Saddam had good reason to believe that
the U.S. government was waving him across the border of
Kuwait.
