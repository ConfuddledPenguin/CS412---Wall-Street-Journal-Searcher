   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's unemployment
rate fell to 6.9% in August from 7.1% in July, the Federal
Labor Office in Nuremberg said.
   The number of unemployed West Germans declined to
1,812,812 in August from 1,863,670 a month earlier, a decline
of 50,858. The figures are better than expectations of
analysts and economists, who had predicted the jobless rate
would remain flat at 7.1%.
