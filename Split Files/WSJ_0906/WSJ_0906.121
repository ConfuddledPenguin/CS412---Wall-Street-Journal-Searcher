   PONCE, Puerto Rico -- Ponce Federal Bank, under fire from
federal regulators, named Miguel D. Lausell chairman.
   Mr. Lausell, 46 years old, an attorney in San Juan, has
been vice chairman since May 1989. He succeeds Ramiro L.
Colon Jr., who stepped down as president and chief executive
officer in mid-August. Mr. Colon was continuing to serve as
chairman while the thrift made several changes in management.

   Last week, Ponce Federal, one of the largest thrifts in
Puerto Rico, was hit with strong enforcement measures by the
Office of Thrift Supervision. The measures, designed to
"increase the bank's safety and soundness," according to the
OTS, included a temporary cease-and-desist order issued
against Mr. Colon, who is still a stockholder, and his
brother, Wendell W. Colon, former counsel at the thrift and
also a stockholder.
   According to the OTS, the Colons have been ordered to stop
causing Ponce Federal to violate federal regulations against
loans to affiliated parties and insider transactions, and to
post a $50,000 bond to make funds available for restitution
to the thrift.
   The Colons weren't available for comment yesterday.
   Mr. Lausell, in a prepared statement, said: "This
realignment of the board of directors should result in
improved oversight of the bank."
   Ponce Federal also said that Federico Montilla, an
architect in San Juan, was named vice chairman.
