   MILWAUKEE -- General Electric Co. engineers have been
taking apart competitors' medical imaging machines, looking
for ways to produce their own systems more economically.
   Facing stiff competition from Europe and Japan in a market
that is increasingly under pressure to reduce health-care
spending, GE is focusing on cost-cutting for the first time,
not only on the technical advances that made it the dominant
player in the diagnostic equipment market for a decade.

   For patients, the changing market means lower diagnostic
fees, but it may also mean that some major advances will
reach the market more slowly. The average cost to patients
for "magnetic resonance imaging," or MRI, the most advanced
diagnostic technology widely available, is about $850. "I can
see that coming down to $500 within two to three years," says
Gregory Freiherr, a medical consultant in Silver Spring, Md.
   GE, which invented the modern X-ray tube in 1913, has long
garnered the lion's share of the U.S. diagnostic equipment
sales and service market, a $4.2 billion a year field that
includes MRI and Computed Tomography, or CT, scanners.
   In recent years, however, Siemens AG of Germany and the
Netherlands' N.V. Philips have increased their U.S. presence.
Philips, for instance, began manufacturing CT scanners last
year in a joint venture with a unit of Japan's Hitachi Ltd.
in Concord, Mass. But what has shaken up the field even more
is Toshiba Corp.'s purchase last year of the MRI business of
Diasonics Inc. of San Francisco.
   "If there's a new aggressor in the market, it's Toshiba,"
says Bobby Bowen, vice president of advanced technology at GE
Medical.
   Toshiba's U.S. medical systems revenue has grown about 50%
annually for the past three years and accounts for 8% of the
MRI and CT market in the U.S. GE Medical's share is estimated
at 44%. Siemens and Philips together have about 29%.
   GE and Philips concede that in the technological
competition, they lost sight of cost and customer needs.
   MRI uses powerful magnetic fields to "see" inside the
human body positioned in the magnetic field. The complex
components of the MRI machine -- magnets to excite the
hydrogen nuclei in the body, coils to send radio frequency,
and software that turns data into images -- provided a rich
field for both significant and marginal technical
improvements. In the early 1980s, more than a dozen
manufacturers offered MRI machines with a multitude of
imaging capabilities, scanning speeds, and other features.
"The whole industry had a tinker toy syndrome," says Mike
Moakley, president of Philips Medical Systems of North
America.
   The same has been true for CT scanning, in which a
computer uses data from multiple X-ray measurements to
reconstruct images. Since CT was introduced in the early
1970s, so many technologies have been added that customers
aren't sure the benefits are worth the costs. In 1987, for
instance, GE introduced a crystal X-ray "detector," replacing
the xenon gas still used in Siemens and Philips detectors.
   But GE's new crystal adds about $150,000 to a CT scanner's
cost. Both technologies "are good and they don't make a
nickel's worth of difference to me," says James Hoffman,
directory of neurology at Emory University Medical School.
The same goes for MRI; no machine seems to enjoy a clear
technological edge, he says. "The real issue is what does it
cost, and there isn't any difference there either."
   Competition has cut the price of MRI machines to about
$1.8 million, down about 5% annually over the past two years,
and discounts off the list price are common. Phil Drew, a
medical equipment consultant in Concord, Mass., expects
prices to slip below $1.4 million by the end of next year as
Toshiba gears up U.S. production and sales.
   CT scanner prices have dropped, too, from a million
dollars in the early 1980s, when the Japanese introduced
low-cost machines, to about $700,000 currently. Philips, in
the joint venture with Hitachi, is building CT machines in
which a microcomputer has replaced the minicomputer,
eliminating the need for an air-conditioning device and other
components, thereby reducing the scanner's size.
   For the past two years, GE Medical has been farming out
manufacture of printed wiring board, harness, and certain
mechanical parts, reducing its cost for those components by
about 25%. Last year, it restructured engineering and
marketing operations to simplify and speed production and to
free sales people to concentrate on customers. "We're trying
to be more attuned to what's going on in the marketplace. We
haven't always done that," says John Trani, head of GE
Medical.
   Last November, the company introduced an artificial
intelligence program, called InSite, to troubleshoot
customers' CT and MRI machines by telephone from a central
location. "GE has come up with a technology that serves as a
marketing tool: It can provide instantaneous service that
gives the customer a warm and fuzzy feeling about GE. No one
else has it," says Mr. Freiherr, the consultant.
   Other companies are linking with Japanese diagnostic
imaging equipment makers, whose manufacturing costs are
estimated at 20% below GE's. Aside from the Hitachi/Philips
link, GE Medical has a joint venture with Yokogawa Medical
Systems Ltd. that began making a mid-level MRI system in
Japan in 1987. Siemens established a tie with Asahi Chemical
Industry Co. a year ago.
   These ventures have marketing as well as manufacturing
aims. The Japanese, constrained by limited hospital space and
medical reimbursement plans, had concentrated on "low to
mid-field" MRI machines, whose magnetic field strengths are
less than 0.5 tesla, or about 10,000 times the strength of
the Earth's magnetic field.
   Major U.S. makers, on the other hand, had been making only
the high-field MRI machines, with field strength at between
one and 1.5 tesla, exceeding power requirements for many
diagnostic procedures.
   "About 20% of the MRI applications are for orthopedic --
for knees, wrists and ankles. We feel the mid-field machine
does the job adequately," says Philips's Mr. Moakley, who
expects that segment to "double in two years." The smaller
machines are easier to install and take up less space, making
them attractive to the smaller hospitals. But with all the
big manufacturers entering the same market niche at once, it
promises to be quite competitive.
   There are legislative pressures, too. Several bills
recently introduced in Congress to bring down health-care
costs specifically target MRI fees.
   Manufacturers respond that they don't set the fees, but
acknowledge that the current climate isn't propitious for
costly new technologies. GE, for instance, is "pacing" its
development of an emerging technology known as "positron
emission tomography," or PET, which produces
three-dimensional images that reflect the metabolic and
chemical activity of tissue. The technology is in clinical
trial, but the company isn't making the kind of investment it
did to rush CT and MRI to market.
   "The marketplace is affecting the pace of our
technologies," says GE Medical's Mr. Bowen. "The government
is very cautious about approving reimbursement for PET. In
the past, if a technology improved patient care, it would be
approved. Now it must also be cost-effective."
