   TOPEKA, Kan. -- In a rebuke of thrift regulators, a
federal judge here ruled that the Office of Thrift
Supervision didn't have grounds to take control of Franklin
Savings Association last February.
   Federal Judge Dale E. Saffels directed the OTS to return
control of Franklin Savings to its previous management,
headed by chairman Ernest M. Fleischer, at 10 a.m. today.
Late yesterday, the OTS said it intends to appeal and would
immediately seek a stay of the order to return control of the
thrift.

   The ruling raises questions about how rigidly regulators
can interpret accounting standards, whether they can seize
control of an institution before it is technically insolvent
and how far they can go in ordering institutions to write off
their bad loans.
   But because of Franklin Savings' structure, it wasn't
immediately clear how far-reaching the decision would be, if
it stands. Mr. Fleischer invested more than 90% of the
Ottawa, Kan., institution's $11.4 billion in assets in
mortgage-backed securities -- a risky strategy, according to
regulators. But he contended that the risks were minimized by
his purchase of substantial financial futures contracts,
which he used to hedge against possible losses on his
portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.
   When the OTS took control, the agency forced the thrift to
recognize immediately about $119 million in losses on its
futures positions. That loss placed Franklin in violation of
federal capital standards, clearing the way for the
conservatorship.
   According to a recent filing with the OTS, Franklin had a
net loss of $176.2 million in the first quarter, reducing its
remaining tangible capital to 0.6% of assets. Thrifts are
required to have tangible capital equal to 1.5% of assets.
   In his decision, Judge Saffels said that the OTS was
"arbitrary and capricious" in its decision to force Franklin
to recognize the losses.
   "The facts of this case clearly show that the regulator
acted wrongly in imposing the conservatorship," Judge Saffels
wrote in his 93-page opinion. "This court must correct that
wrongful action."
   Lawyers specializing in thrift law said they couldn't
assess the impact of Judge Saffels' decision until they had
read the opinion, but they agreed that his remedy, returning
the thrift to previous management, was extraordinary. "Any
decision that says you have to give the institution back the
next morning is pretty tough," said attorney Bill Sweet of
Washington, D.C.
   "It is a legal and operational nightmare to untangle an
institution and give it back," said Thomas P. Vartanian, a
former thrift regulator. Mr. Vartanian said he recalled only
one instance in which a judge ordered a thrift returned to
previous management. That order, involving a Florida thrift,
was overturned by a federal appeals court in 1983, he said.
   Judge Saffels said he will retain jurisdiction for 90
days, during which the OTS will have to obtain his permission
to reimpose a conservator or to place Franklin in
receivership.
   In an unusual meeting with reporters after the order was
released, Judge Saffels said: "We want to at least give
Franklin {and its former managers} a chance to see if they
can run this institution again." The judge declined to
predict what an appeals court might do about his order,
saying: "We never like to predict them. They make too many
mistakes."
   In a statement yesterday, OTS chief counsel Harris
Weinstein said the agency continues to believe "that the
government acted in a timely and proper manner in taking over
Franklin.
   "The OTS continues to believe that prior to the
conservatorship order, Franklin was placing excessive
reliance on high-risk assets financed by high-cost and mobile
brokered deposits and that, at the same time, Franklin used
improper accounting methods under which it recognized gains
and deferred losses while distributing more than $45 million
of the institution's funds in dividends to the shareholders,"
Mr. Weinstein added in a statement.
   Mr. Fleischer, Franklin's chairman, said he wouldn't
change the thrift's operations if allowed to take control
again. But he indicated that one of his first acts would be
to assess any losses Franklin may have suffered during the
almost seven months it was under regulators' control.
