   TORONTO -- Inco Ltd., a nickel producer, said that the
death toll from an explosion last week at its Indonesian
subsidiary's nickel smelter rose to six from a previously
reported two, and that the company was still seeking to
evaluate damage and the effect on production.
   The explosion took place in one of the smelter's three
furnaces, after the first week of a five-week shutdown for
maintenance and expansion. The smelter is operated by Inco's
58%-owned subsidiary, PT International Nickel Indonesia.
