   NEW YORK -- Help-wanted advertising continued its sluggish
pace in July, unchanged from June's five-year low.
   The Conference Board said its index of help-wanted
advertising remained at 132 in July, sharply down from a
year-earlier 147. June's figure was revised from 133. The
index, a seasonally adjusted indicator of hiring plans, uses
1967 as a base of 100.

   Although July's lackluster results had been expected, the
Conference Board said a previously optimistic outlook for the
second half has been harmed by the risk of war in the Middle
East.
   "As of Aug. 1, the economy in general, and the labor
market in particular, was poised for a modest uptick in the
second half of this year," said Conference Board economist
Ken Goldstein. "However, events in the Middle East changed
all that." Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, leading to the current
armed standoff in the region between Iraq and U.S.-led forces
and a world-wide trade embargo against Iraq.
   Mr. Goldstein said exporters, business investors and
consumers are more likely to put some plans on hold because
of that crisis. As a result, no big staff expansions are
expected in the next few months, which could hurt chances of
quickly turning around help-wanted volume growth.
   Nevertheless, the independent business research group said
it doesn't expect the economy to head into a recession,
although growth will be sluggish.
   The worsening economic prospects could be harmful to the
New England and Middle Atlantic states, which seemed on the
verge of coming out of a steep decline. The New England
region posted a 2.5% increase in want-ad volume in July.
   Job advertising in the Mountain, East South Central and
Pacific regions started to decline at a faster pace in July,
the Conference Board said. The West South Central region
remained stable, however.
   The index is compiled from monthly surveys of advertising
volume in 51 major newspapers.
