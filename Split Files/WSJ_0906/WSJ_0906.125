   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- If war breaks out in the Persian
Gulf, the U.S. hopes the fighting goes something like this:
   In the air, U.S. pilots use electronic deception to
confuse distant Iraqi warplanes and then blast them with
infrared missiles. At sea, the battleship Wisconsin launches
cruise missiles that devastate distant Iraqi command centers.
Close to the ground, Apache helicopters fire laser-guided
Hellfire missiles that cripple Iraqi tank columns still miles
away.

   Within days, Iraq's air force is destroyed, its army is
ragged and Saddam Hussein is in full retreat. American
casualties number in the hundreds, rather than the thousands
some feared.
   So goes the Pentagon's optimistic vision of an offensive
against Iraq and its troops in Kuwait: Fighting from afar and
exploiting high-tech weaponry, the U.S. wins against an enemy
that can't see its attackers. But this scenario of lots of
glory and little gore may prove more fantasy than reality in
a modern war in the exposed desert. The U.S. may have
superior air power and electronic weaponry, but Iraq, with
its huge army and larger number of tanks and artillery, is
still powerful on land. A war could -- contrary to Pentagon
thinking -- suck thousands of American troops into a killing
field.
   The Arab-Israeli conflict in 1973 showed what can happen
when large forces of planes and ground troops fight in the
open desert. In just two weeks of battle, 20,000 soldiers
were killed or wounded and 1,500 tanks and 550 aircraft were
destroyed.
   Can the U.S.'s technology advantage make a marked
difference? Clearly, it gives American troops an edge, but
how much of one no one really knows. Many of the weapons the
U.S. is deploying, including the Hellfire missile, designed
to destroy tanks, and the Patriot missile, designed to shoot
down missiles and aircraft, have never been tested in battle.
Neither have the vast majority of U.S. troops, whose training
consists of war games in the California and Egyptian deserts.
   The U.S. will do all it can to avoid slugging it out in
prolonged ground warfare, of course. The model for the way it
hopes to fight is Israel's stunning 1982 victory over Syria's
air force in Lebanon. The Israelis used technology with keen
effectiveness. They first sent a series of unmanned aircraft
outfitted with sophisticated electronics over Syrian
anti-aircraft sites in the Bekaa Valley. The drones fooled
the Syrians into launching most of their missiles before
Israeli jets even arrived, and also detected the radar
frequencies the Syrians were using. Israeli F-4s then fired
radar-guided missiles to destroy the Syrian radar antennae
while F-16s and A-4s dropped cluster bombs that smashed the
rest of the sites. When the battle was over, the Israelis had
destroyed 17 Syrian missile sites and 85 Syrian jets. Israel
didn't lose a single aircraft.
   "This is what we'd like to do in principle," says retired
Maj. Gen. Gerald Carey, former commander of the Air Force's
Tactical Air Warfare Center.
   American planners believe the U.S. is deploying an
overwhelming arsenal on the Arabian peninsula but say that,
if the U.S. ultimately does launch an offensive, it wouldn't
do so for at least several weeks. In any engagement, says
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of American forces in
the Middle East, "we would be using capabilities that are far
more lethal, far more accurate and far more effective than
anything we have ever used."
   The centerpiece of the U.S. arsenal is its capability to
wage the most sophisticated electronic warfare ever seen. A
U.S. attack on Iraqi forces would begin with a wave of air
strikes against anti-aircraft missile installations. The
success of the U.S. missions would turn largely on systems
aboard U.S. planes that jam enemy communications, warn of
enemy radar tracking U.S. planes and point U.S. missiles and
bombs to enemy targets. In many cases, these advanced systems
would make many of the judgments about who the enemy is and
when to fire at him.
   The U.S. strike would also begin far from the target
itself. Outside the range of Iraqi anti-aircraft missiles,
two U.S. EF-111 and EC-130 jamming aircraft would circle. The
EF-111 jet would direct waves of electronic signals at Iraqi
radarscopes, which control the Iraqi surface-to-air missiles,
burying the radar operators under a blizzard of electronic
noise that masks the advance of U.S. warplanes. At the same
time, the lumbering EC-130 turboprop would jam the
communications links within the missile site and between the
site and command centers around Iraq. The Iraqi missile base
would then be blind, deaf and isolated.
   Four U.S. warplanes -- one stubby F-4G "Wild Weasel" and
three sleek F-16 attack jets -- would then swoop into action.
The F4G would launch HARM air-to-ground missiles, which home
in on the Iraqi tracking beam from the missile site, and
follow it to the ground, destroying the radar antenna and
rendering the missiles useless. The HARM missiles are
especially potent, says Gen. Carey: "Either he {the Iraqi}
shuts down his radar and his missiles are no good or he stays
on and gets destroyed."
   The F-4G also would relay targeting information to the
F-16s, which then would drop a load of cluster bombs packed
with shrapnel. If all went according to plan, the missile
sites would be destroyed in just 10 minutes.
   That's what happens if the Iraqis don't have any
electronics tricks of their own. HARMs can be fooled by
missile sites equipped with radar that can jump frequencies
-- making it hard for the HARM to lock onto the telltale
signal -- or by sites that can launch decoys to distract the
U.S. missiles. Gen. Carey doubts the Iraqis have such
sophisticated defenses, but it's impossible to know for sure.
   Meanwhile, America's F-117 Stealth fighter, the newest
aircraft to be deployed in the Gulf, would be used to attack
command centers and other heavily defended sites where
surprise and accuracy are key. The Stealth, which would
likely be used only at night, is notable for its ability to
elude detection by radar.
   The plane made its debut in Panama, where two dropped
2,000-pound bombs. Although Defense Secretary Cheney boasted
of the aircraft's "pinpoint accuracy," it later became clear
that one of the jets missed its target by 160 yards.
   Assuming at this point that Iraqi air defenses and command
centers have been knocked out, the U.S. could begin its
offensive against Iraq's forward ground forces. The first
move would probably be a helicopter attack on Iraq's tanks at
night. In the past helicopters generally weren't used for
that type of engagement. They couldn't carry enough firepower
and had to get dangerously close to their targets and be
pointed directly at them to score a hit.
   The Army expects the twin-rotor, bulbous-nosed Apache,
with its armor-piercing rockets and clusters of Hellfire
missiles, to revolutionize anti-tank warfare. Barreling
toward its target at nearly 150 miles an hour -- fast for a
helicopter -- the Apache is designed to fly just 30 or 40
feet off the ground for hours at a time. If its nose isn't in
line with its enemy, the two-man crew can rely on advanced
laser-guided homing systems to guide its 16 Hellfire missiles
to the tanks. Similarly, the Apache can hide behind, say, a
sand dune, and use the Hellfire's on-board computers to help
the missiles jig over obstacles, identify a target that isn't
visible to the pilots, and then lock on and destroy it.
   Each missile costs about $30,000, so even veteran Apache
pilots have fired relatively few of them in training. But the
crews say the desert's flat terrain and long distances are
ideal for the Apache's tank-killing capabilities.
   "We can take out 200 tanks easy in about two hours," Army
Lt. Col. Dick Cody, commander of an Apache batallion, told
reporters last month. "It's a pilot's dream out here."
   But it's a potential nightmare too.
   To begin with, dodging dense Iraqi ground fire may be
riskier than Saudi and American pilots expect. Israel used
high-tech weaponry in its Lebanon victory but also relied
heavily on intimate knowledge of Syrian capabilities and
exhaustive practice of the raid. "That's a lot different from
the U.S. suddenly finding itself in Arabia," observes one
Marine general. "We're still asking, `Now, what do we know
about the Iraqis?'"
   What's more, the recent record of U.S. air efforts in the
region isn't reassuring. The 1980 attempt to rescue the U.S.
hostages in Iran ended in humiliation when aircraft failed
and crashed into each other deep in the Iranian desert,
killing eight servicemen. In 1983, the U.S. bungled an attack
on Syrian anti-aircraft guns and missile batteries in
Lebanon. It has had better luck shooting down Libyan jets in
two altercations in the 1980s, but in 1986, when the U.S.
launched an air raid against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's
headquarters, only two of the nine F-111 bombers involved
even dropped their bombs; neither hit the targets precisely.
One plane was shot down or crashed, and another mistakenly
attacked a civilian neighborhood.
   American air crews face far tougher obstacles in the Gulf
than in Lebanon or Libya. Many U.S. pilots in Saudi Arabia
are still trying to learn the terrain, become familiar with
complicated air-traffic control procedures and fly routine
patrols with Saudi aircraft. "I haven't flown yet with the
Saudis at all," Air Force Lt. Alan Kollien, a pilot with the
1st Tactical Fighter Wing from Langley, Va., recently told
reporters.
   The Iraqis are trying their utmost, too, to confuse
American pilots. U.S. officers say that in the past few weeks
Iraq has moved or changed the operation of some of the 300
missile batteries the country is believed to have. Without
up-to-date information about the batteries, American flyers
hurtling over an unfamiliar border could turn into vulnerable
targets.
   Even commanders in the field acknowledge that aircraft and
their sophisticated weapons can't do the job by themselves.
Air power alone "didn't work on the Ho Chi Minh trail, and it
won't work on the battlefield of the future," says Gen. Ed
Scholes, chief of staff for most of the Army troops in Saudi
Arabia.
   But ground forces, too, face huge obstacles, and even the
best technology probably wouldn't save them from heavy
losses. Partly because many of its heavy tanks haven't yet
arrived, and partly because it needs distance to take full
advantage of its stand-off weaponry, the U.S. would fall back
into the Saudi desert if Iraq attacked, say military
planners. The Americans would then disrupt Iraq's
communications and supply lines.
   But this shoot-and-run maneuver counts on some of the
long-range weapons -- both on the ground and in the air -- to
operate exceptionally well despite their record of performing
badly in tough conditions. Panama's hothouse humidity, for
instance, created major difficulties for the Apache's
targeting electronics. In the Persian Gulf, helicopters built
to sit on airport concrete would have trouble operating from
the rough desert floor for more than a few weeks, U.S.
officers predict. Moreover, in many cases their engines have
to be flushed daily to prevent sand damage.
   The desert's fine dust can jam machine guns, damage jet
turbines and even wear down tank treads. Dust storms, whether
caused by nature or by the movement of tanks, would obscure
enemy targets and could force U.S. troops to hold off firing
their vaunted anti-tank TOW missiles, exposing the Americans
to Iraqi tank fire.
   Coordinating a broad ground and air offensive poses
another problem: communication between U.S. and allied Arab
troops and between different branches of the U.S. armed
services. That's a longstanding American weakness. In
Grenada, some U.S. troops could see Navy ships offshore, but
weren't able to communicate with them.
   What's more, formal coordination arrangements still
haven't been worked out between U.S. and Saudi commanders.
Indeed, says one military electronics expert, the U.S. can't
use its top-of-the-line radios, which hop frequencies to
protect against eavesdropping, because the Saudi government
fears the equipment will interfere with Saudi television
broadcasts.
   In the end, simple provisions such as food and water could
prove more significant in the Gulf crisis than an array of
sophisticated weaponry. In a lengthy standoff, soldiers would
have to be kept fit for action. U.S. intelligence officials
say that Iraqi soldiers already are stealing food, water and
gasoline at gunpoint from fleeing Kuwaiti refugees,
indicating shortages of essentials are occurring at the
front.
   But retired Army general Elmer Pendleton, once the
Pentagon's top officer in Turkey, is quick to add an
additional word of caution. Even if Iraqi troops prove
ill-equipped and ill-trained, he argues, they amount to "a
hell of a lot of people, and they can do a lot of damage."
