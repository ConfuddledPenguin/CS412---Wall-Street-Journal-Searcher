   CANTON, Ohio -- Timken Co., which produces bearings and
specialty steel, said it will spend about $5 million to build
a machining facility in Santa Barbara d'Oeste, Brazil, about
95 miles north of Sao Paulo, as part of the company's
previously announced $1 billion capital investment program.
The plant will turn forgings into bearing cups and cones.
