   AUSTIN, Texas -- Communications Transmission Inc. said it
received a $15.2 million payment from Metromedia/ITT, a unit
of Metromedia Co. of Secaucus, N.J., for early termination of
an analog lease agreement.
   CTI said it had been receiving monthly revenue from the
agreement of about $871,000. Under its original terms, the
agreement would have lasted as long as 1994.

   The operator of microwave and fiberoptic communications
networks said this was its last analog contract. It remains a
provider of digital transmission services, including to
Metromedia.
   CTI said the payment will be used for working capital and
to repay long-term debt.
