   Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France, a pharmaceutical and
chemical concern, said first-half net income fell 13% to 2.18
billion francs ($410.9 million) from 2.49 billion francs a
year earlier. The results are after payments to minority
interests but before priority dividends.
   Operating profit declined 20% to 3.75 billion francs from
4.69 billion francs. Finance charges rose to 1.66 billion
francs from 1.02 billion francs.

   Consolidated revenue increased 7.8% to 39.99 billion
francs, but decreased 5.6% on a comparable structural basis.
   As in the first quarter, Rhone-Poulenc blamed Brazil's
economic stabilization program and the franc's recent
strength for the company's poor showing. Brazil, which has
imposed austerity measures, represents 7% to 8% of group
revenue.
   The company gave no indication that conditions would
improve during the second half, citing "a worsening economic
situation" owing to "the dollar's slide, higher oil prices
and slowing growth."
