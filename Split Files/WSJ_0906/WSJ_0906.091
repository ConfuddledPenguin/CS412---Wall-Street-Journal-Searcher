   TORONTO -- Ontario, Canada's largest province, is to hold
its legislative elections today, and opinion polls indicate a
tight race between the governing Liberal Party and the
socialist New Democratic Party.
   Support for the Liberals, led by Premier David Peterson,
has declined partly because of alleged irregularities in
party fund-raising.

   The New Democrats, led by lawyer Bob Rae, have never
formed a government in Ontario, the headquarters of Canada's
major financial institutions and much of the country's
industry. The province has more than a third of the country's
population of 26.5 million.
   The New Democrats have proposed a substantial increase in
spending to be financed partly by a minimum corporate tax of
about 8%, a property speculation tax and death duties on
estates of at least one million Canadian dollars
(US$862,000). The party's spending proposals include
low-interest loans for farmers, home buyers and small
businesses.
   The Liberals have proposed cutting the provincial sales
tax to 7% from 8%, increasing in spending on mass transit and
improving social programs such as school breakfasts for needy
children.
   The Progressive Conservative Party, which governed Ontario
from 1943 to 1985 and currently controls the national
government in Ottawa, has trailed the Liberals and New
Democrats in recent opinion polls. In the last Ontario
election in 1987, the Liberals won 95 seats in the 130-seat
provincial legislature. The New Democrats won 19 and the
Conservatives 16.
