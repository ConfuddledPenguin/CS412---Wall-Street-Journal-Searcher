   MONTREAL -- Charles Bronfman, majority owner of the
Montreal Expos, said directors extended the deadline for the
sale of the baseball team, giving a group of potential local
buyers more time to put together a formal offer.
   After a meeting of the team's board Tuesday evening Mr.
Bronfman wouldn't specify the new deadline but told reporters
"we're pretty darned encouraged" the Expos will be sold to
Quebec buyers.

   Mr. Bronfman, co-chairman of Seagram Co., and his two
minority partners originally set a deadline of Sept. 1 for a
local bid. They set a price of 100 million Canadian dollars
(US$86.2 million).
   Expos president Claude Brochu and a local investment
dealer have been scrambling to put together a group of local
buyers. "The pressure isn't off, believe me," Mr. Brochu said
after Mr. Bronfman's announcement.
   So far only one potential investor has stepped forward. A
unit of Desjardins Group, a financial services concern, said
it is ready to put up C$5 million as part of a buying group.
Desjardins also said the Quebec and Montreal governments will
have to help the local group acquire the Expos.
