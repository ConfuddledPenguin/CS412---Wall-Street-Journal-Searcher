   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The airline industry said that it is
concerned about a rash of retirements among key Federal
Aviation Administration personnel, including air traffic
controllers.
   The Air Transport Association, which represents major
carriers, said the agency's loss of 341 people last month
jeopardizes the FAA's critical air traffic control and
airways operations.

   There are approximately 50,000 FAA employees.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar confirmed the figure and said it
was twice the normal number of retirees for a month. The
increase, he said, was primarily because of concern over
possible changes in federal retirement rules.
   Aviation Daily, which reports on the airline industry,
stated on Tuesday that the retirees included 117 controllers,
84 electronic technicians, 17 engineers, 11 safety
inspectors, two FAA pilots and 110 in other categories.
   The Bush administration, in congressional budget
negotiations, has proposed eliminating a provision that
allows employees to get back their individual retirement
contributions in two annual lump sums.
   If the rules change, only those who retired 30 days before
the program expires Sept. 30 would be eligible to get the
lump-sum payments.
   Mr. Farrar said controllers are eligible to retire at age
50 if they have worked for 20 years and at any age after 25
years of active air traffic control work.
   FAA employees contribute 7% of their pay to the retirement
program and can receive it all back in two payments at the
end of service, while continuing to receive a reduced monthly
payment based on government contributions to the program.
