   Sales for the British tobacco and financial services
conglomerate rose 13% to #9.38 billion from #8.27 billion a
year earlier. The results reflect damage arising from a
protracted battle B.A.T mounted to deflect a takeover bid by
Sir James Goldsmith. The company wrote off #26 million in
costs for regulatory hearings and defense costs in the fight.
   The battle hastened a restructuring at B.A.T that included
the disposal of the company's U.S. retailing operations.
These sales created #414 million in profits, which translated
into a further 10.7 pence-a-share interim dividend, upping
the total paid so far this year to 20.7 pence from 19.6 pence
a year earlier.
   The biggest setback occurred in the Eagle Star insurance
business, which was hit by heavy payments from storms. Eagle,
which also extends property loan guarantees, had to raise its
reserves #40 million.
