   OKLAHOMA CITY -- They're raising the roof here, but
they're doing it by the book -- sort of.
   In a 1989 novel by Jim Lehrer, fictional Oklahoma Gov.
Buffalo Joe Haman -- Chip to his friends -- is tormented by
the sight of the statehouse's flat roof, a mocking reminder
that in 1916 his state ran out of money before it could build
a dome atop the capitol. He exhorts any crowd of two or more
citizens to "Crown Oklahoma," which happens to be the title
of the book by Mr. Lehrer, of public television's
McNeil/Lehrer News Hour.

   Actually, Oklahomans did run out of money before finishing
the capitol building in 1916. After Oklahoma wildcatters
struck oil in the late 1920s, the state had the means to
complete the dome but lost interest. State residents were
content to boast of the only state capitol in the U.S. with
working oil wells on its grounds.
   Now, since the capitol wells and the state economy began
drying up in the mid-1980s, there is growing sentiment here
to raise the dome and, with it, state morale. So Gov. Henry
Bellmon and Capitol DOMERS Inc. (Dedicated Oklahomans
Marshaling Excellence and Rallying Spirits) have kicked off a
fund-raising campaign not only to crown the statehouse but
also to pave a piece of its lawn.
   The DOMERS group has its roots in the recession that has
gripped the state for much of the past decade. In 1987,
Oklahoma City activist Carol Gwin decided that finishing the
capitol building could lift the state's spirits. To get the
job done, she recruited other retirees, including Adm.
William J. Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and currently a professor at the University of
Oklahoma.
   The nonprofit group hopes to raise $14 million for the
dome and to build a plaza at the south entrance of the
capitol building. To help raise the money, the group is
offering citizens the right -- for $250 each -- to have
paving stones for the plaza engraved with names of their
choosing. "This is a symbol of our efforts to move forward,"
says architect Paul B. Meyer, a consultant to the Capitol
Preservation Commission.
   After Mr. Lehrer's book appeared, members fell into a long
debate. Should they lift its title for the name of their
campaign? "We would have had to make it `Crown Oklahoma,
Crown Oklahoma,'" cracks Mr. Meyer, "because Buffalo Joe had
a habit of saying everything twice." Instead the group
settled for "Raising Oklahoma."
