   TORONTO -- Abitibi-Price Inc. said its unionized workers
in Eastern Canada set a strike deadline of 8 a.m., Sept. 10.
   Abitibi, the second-largest newsprint producer in the
world, said members of the Canadian Paperworkers Union voted
77% in favor of a strike if agreement isn't reached before
the deadline.

   The company said negotiations with the union will resume
here Sept. 7. Talks were suspended Aug. 20 so that the union
could take a strike vote.
   A strike would close most of Abitibi's newsprint mills,
which are concentrated in Eastern Canada. Abitibi has total
annual newsprint capacity of about 1.95 million metric tons,
or about 8% of North American capacity. A metric ton equals
about 2,204.62 pounds.
   A strike wouldn't have an immediate impact on newspaper
publishers and other newsprint users. Publishers of U.S.
daily newspapers had an average 41-day supply of newsprint on
hand at the end of July. As well, other newsprint makers can
boost their output in the event of a strike. But supplies are
already fairly tight and a strike at Abitibi would put upward
pressure on prices, newsprint buyers said.
   An Abitibi spokeswoman said that when talks were suspended
only minor issues had been settled. "We're very early in the
negotiations process," the official said.
   The union declined to comment until it notifies its
members, but a union official confirmed the vote results and
strike deadline.
