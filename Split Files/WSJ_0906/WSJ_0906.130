   WASHINGTON -- Affable, mild-mannered, middle-class John
Ray has just been endorsed for mayor of the nation's capital
by a public-housing tenants' group long identified with
support for flamboyant, rough-hewn incumbent Marion Barry,
whose arrest on drug charges led him to drop his re-election
bid. How could the group now choose someone so different?
   "Oh, we still support Marion Barry," says white-haired
Lucille Savage, as a knot of women nearby nod vigorously.
"It's just that he's not running."

   The District of Columbia is electing a mayor this year, a
fact nearly lost amid the sound and fury surrounding Mr.
Barry's arrest and trial. The campaign had begun to attract
an unusually large and diverse field even before Mr. Barry's
legal troubles took hold, and the task for whoever wins is
immense: nothing less than a new beginning for a traumatized
city. Yet with the primary less than a week away, the talk
here remains less about who is in the race than who isn't.
   "Barry so dominated the scene here, it doesn't take a
rocket scientist to say there's a vacuum," says Mark Plotkin,
a one-time local Democratic activist who is now the political
editor of a radio station. Adds Ron Lester, a pollster whose
firm has worked for Mr. Barry in the past: "The public's
attention has basically been frozen on the trial."
   Behind that wall of seeming indifference brews the first
major realignment in the city's political leadership since
Mr. Barry's election a dozen years ago. The two most
important citywide officials after the mayor -- the city
council chairman and the district's nonvoting delegate to
Congress -- both abandoned their posts to enter the
Democratic mayoral primary.
   The winner's first task may be to heal the divisions of
race, gender and even class stirred by Mr. Barry's arrest and
trial. In a city that is nearly three-quarters black, Mr.
Barry's charges that he was set up as part of a federal
campaign of harassment of black elected officials resonate
with many voters. If anything, his conviction on a single
misdemeanor cocaine-possession charge -- after the government
expended vast resources in a fruitless effort to nail him on
felony charges -- may have buttressed his arguments; the
mayor is now running for a seat on the city council.
   The Barry trial also brought to the fore residents'
long-simmering resentment over the city's "last colony"
status, symbolized most recently by Congress's refusal to let
it use its own local tax money to pay for abortions for poor
women. And it has even stirred a debate in some quarters here
over the appropriate role of black women in the community;
the former girlfriend who cooperated with authorities in the
mayor's trial has become a target of abuse, unlike the two
other former girlfriends who went to jail rather than testify
against him.
   Stepping into this potentially volatile mix are the five
Democrats competing to replace Mr. Barry, four of them black
and two of them women. In addition, there is an unaccustomed
challenge from the district's tiny Republican Party, which
this year has a potentially strong candidate in former Police
Chief Maurice Turner.
   Currently leading, according to local polls, is Councilman
John Ray, a 47-year-old lawyer whose stolid, uncharismatic
personal style masks a poignant personal history. Born and
raised in a turpentine camp in rural Georgia, Mr. Ray never
knew his father and was reared by grandparents who couldn't
read. He was able to obtain a higher education after serving
in the Air Force, and he clerked for the late Supreme Court
Justice Abe Fortas. An 11-year city council veteran, he has
portrayed himself as the city's "best hope," and his
literature touts him as "a role model for our youth."
   Political analysts say Mr. Ray's lead -- polls indicate he
has the support of about a third of the voters as well as
leading in endorsements and fund-raising -- has occurred so
far mainly because he has alienated the fewest voters. "His
support is not strong, but it's broad," says Mr. Lester, the
pollster. Mr. Ray's opponents have sought to damage him by
hammering at his numerous contributions from developers and
real-estate interests, which account for about a third of his
$900,000 war chest.
   Closest to Mr. Ray in the polls has been Charlene Drew
Jarvis, who, like the other woman candidate, Sharon Pratt
Dixon, comes from a distinguished Washington family. Ms.
Jarvis is the daughter of the late Charles Drew, who invented
a method for developing blood plasma. Holder of a doctorate
in neuropsychology, the 49-year-old Ms. Jarvis abandoned a
promising career in science to enter politics and now has a
reputation as a tough infighter whose skills rival those of
Mr. Barry.
   But like Mr. Barry, she has suffered from unsavory
connections: A one-time social companion and campaign manager
received thousands of dollars in consulting fees from a
national bank seeking a foothold here at a time when Ms.
Jarvis had significant influence over the banking community.
She now calls the association a mistake.
   The remaining three candidates are closely grouped,
trailing Mr. Ray and Ms. Jarvis in polls but still within
striking distance. Of them, the most puzzling is Walter
Fauntroy, at 57 the oldest candidate and the early favorite
in the race because of his 19 years as the district's
nonvoting representative to Congress.
   Mr. Fauntroy says he entered the race out of disgust at
the ineptitude of local officials. In a recent televised
debate, he compared himself to a star football player,
saying, "Here I am clearing holes in the line on Capitol
Hill, making it possible for them to get millions of dollars,
and they are fumbling the ball in the background. . . . What
I'm saying is, give me the ball now."
   But his candidacy has faltered on charges of
ineffectiveness in Congress and on a backlash against his
sharp attacks on Mr. Ray, including his suggestion that local
real-estate interests -- which are white-dominated -- "own"
Mr. Ray.
   If Mr. Fauntroy's star has dimmed, the hot candidate of
the moment may be Ms. Dixon. Daughter of a judge and former
wife of a council chairman, she has never held elective
office. But the 46-year-old lawyer, former Democratic
National Committee official and utility-company executive has
become the rising star in the race, having won the surprise
endorsement of the powerful Washington Post.
   The Post applauded her stance as the first and only
candidate to call for Mr. Barry's resignation; the paper also
lauded her detailed plans to stabilize the city's
deteriorating financial condition. But her very willingness
to tackle tough fiscal issues may work against her. One of
her plans, for instance, is to trim the city's payroll by
laying off at least 2,000 workers. But that is just the sort
of thing that sends chills down the spine of the city's
48,000 employees -- an extraordinary number in a city of only
about 600,000 residents.
   Ms. Dixon, like Ms. Jarvis, may also suffer because of her
gender. She says she has been surprised by the number of
voters who have told her the city needs "a black male role
model" after the trauma of Mr. Barry's trial; a Washington
Post poll indicated that more than 20% of voters feel that
the mayor should be a man.
   But the person facing the most resistance in the race is
probably the lone white candidate, City Council Chairman
David Clarke. The 46-year-old lawyer is often criticized for
a volcanic temper, but more damaging are poll findings that
nearly half of the city's voters, black and white alike,
believe the next mayor should be black.
   Mr. Clarke has been closely identified with black issues
and concerns -- he briefly attended the same seminary as
Martin Luther King Jr. and received his law degree from
predominately black Howard University. But few observers give
him much of a chance in the current charged atmosphere. Mr.
Clarke himself, asked about the racial issue at a recent
candidates' forum, responded: "God made me white. There's
nothing I can do about that."
