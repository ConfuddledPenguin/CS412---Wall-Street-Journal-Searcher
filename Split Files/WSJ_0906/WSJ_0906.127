   BRADDOCK, Pa. -- USX Corp. will bring in bagpipers
tomorrow for the launch of a $250 million investment at its
historic steel mill here. But not everyone in this boarded-up
town is joining in the parade.
   The company says the investment -- in a continuous slab
caster by its USS steelmaking division -- ensures the
survival of steel in the industry's cradle, the depressed Mon
Valley region near Pittsburgh. The steel giant had considered
abandoning the region entirely during steel's skid in the
1980s.

   There aren't many steelworkers left in Braddock to
celebrate, though. In the past decade, USX reduced employees
in the area to 4,000 in three plants from 30,000 in five
plants as the company focused its activities more on
flat-rolled sheet steels for such customers as auto and
appliance makers. The union says the new caster will actually
cut employment by as much as 400, but the alternative --
shutting down -- was worse.
   For USX, the project is a nostalgic return to its roots:
The caster will be part of the Edgar Thomson plant, Andrew
Carnegie's first steel mill, and the bagpipers will recall
the steel mogul's Scottish heritage. The equipment the caster
will replace, vintage 1938, would have been more appropriate
to Mr. Carnegie's time.
   The dual-strand caster, which will be completed in
mid-1992, will have an annual capacity of 2.6 million tons.
Continuous casting eliminates several laborious and
energy-intensive steps in making flat-rolled steel,
significantly reducing processing time and lowering costs.
The state-of-the-art caster will also improve quality.
   Pittsburgh-based USX agreed to build the caster in a labor
agreement reached in 1987. It also plans a similar-size
investment to rebuild a nearby strip mill, which will use the
steel made in Braddock.
   "It's a recommitment to the Mon Valley," USS President
Thomas C. Graham says of the caster. But, he adds, "it
couldn't transform (the valley) back on the scale that it
once was."
   Braddock Mayor Thomas Napolitano isn't expecting any
miracles, either, though he says Braddock will take what it
can get. "When they put that kind of money in a town like
this, you know they're going to stay for a few years.
Hopefully, we'll get something back in this town."
   Braddock's population, which 25 years ago was about
20,000, is down to 4,600. When steel left town, so did the
movies, jewelry stores, even the grocery store. For a while,
the only work to be found was in boarding up or knocking down
buildings. Locals describe it as a giant parking lot with no
cars.
   Braddock folks "don't know what (the caster) is, but they
figure something new is coming in," said Paul Tkach, a
retired steelworker in Braddock.
   But nobody expects a return to prosperity for the Mon
Valley. "No way," said Mr. Tkach. "It'll never be that way
again."
