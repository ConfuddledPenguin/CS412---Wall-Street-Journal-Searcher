   WASHINGTON -- Robert D. McTeer Jr., a 22-year veteran of
the Federal Reserve System, was named president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
   Mr. McTeer, 47 years old, is currently senior vice
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in charge
of its Baltimore branch. He will succeed Robert H. Boykin,
who retires Feb. 1 after 37 years at the Dallas Fed, the last
10 as president.

   Bush administration officials said that Mr. McTeer's chief
rival for the Dallas post was Michael Darby, currently
undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs and formerly
assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy in the
Reagan administration.
   Mr. McTeer, who earned a doctorate in international and
monetary economics at the University of Georgia, declined to
describe his economic philosophy. For the past decade, his
responsibilities at the Fed have been primarily "managerial"
rather than policy-oriented, he said.
   Presidents of the 12 regional Fed banks oversee banks in
their jurisdictions and join the seven Fed governors in
Washington in making monetary policy. Five of the Fed
presidents sit as voting members of the policy-making Open
Market Committee at any one time; Mr. McTeer won't have a
vote until 1993.
   A president of a regional Fed bank is chosen by the
directors of that bank, subject to approval by the Fed's
board of governors in Washington.
