   Pathe Communications Co. could decide to partially finance
its $1.3 billion acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co. by
leveraging the movie studio's assets, according to proxy
materials mailed to shareholders by MGM/UA.
   Pathe, based in Beverly Hills, and MGM/UA, of Culver City,
Calif., are in discussions about agreements in which MGM/UA
would "purchase" Pathe assets such as films and theaters, and
Pathe would use this cash to buy MGM/UA. In this way, by
pre-selling rights to MGM/UA's film libraries and borrowing
against various MGM/UA assets and receivables, Pathe could
conceivably have access to all the cash MGM/UA would be
capable of raising, up to the value of Pathe's assets. This
could be from $500 million to $700 million, say individuals
close to the negotiations. The transactions would occur
simultaneously with closing the merger.

   Pathe's bid was revised and extended after a potential
$650 million loan from Time Warner Inc. was withdrawn,
leaving a trail of litigation and more skepticism about the
ability of Pathe and its principal, Italian financier
Giancarlo Parretti, to finance the deal.
   Shareholders will attend a special meeting Oct. 2 to vote
on the tender offer, which is to be completed by Oct. 23.
