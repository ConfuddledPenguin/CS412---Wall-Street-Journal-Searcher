   In an unorthodox move, RJR Nabisco plans to introduce its
new Sterling budget cigarettes with ads that compare
Sterling's low price with the cost of rivals' full-priced
smokes.
   The catch is that RJR runs the risk of having smokers
trade down from its full-priced brands. Marketing experts
warn that with this campaign, RJR effectively concedes to
consumers that full-cost smokes are overpriced.

   The ads, scheduled to begin appearing in magazines and on
billboards early next month, compare Sterling to Benson &amp;
Hedges and Virginia Slims, both Philip Morris brands, and to
Kent, which is made by Lorillard. One billboard ad shows a
pack of Benson &amp; Hedges on the left with the word "Dollars."
A pack of Sterling appears on the right, next to the word
"Sense." The ads were created by Long, Haymes &amp; Carr.
   The ads don't, of course, compare Sterling to RJR
Nabisco's own regular smokes, like Winston or Camel, but
marketing experts say the Sterling ads will have a negative
rub-off on them, too. "This sounds like one more in a long
series of brand introductions where RJR's shooting itself in
the foot," says Edward Popper, professor of marketing at
Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I.
   Sterling will be priced $3 a carton less than regular
cigarettes, which sell for $17 a carton in states like
California and Texas; in other states like New York, the
price is somewhat higher.
   Originally, when tobacco makers concocted discount smokes,
the idea was that they would be barely advertised. Instead,
they would be simply thrown out to retailers to satisfy a
small niche of consumers so price-sensitive that they would
rather quit than pay for brand imagery. Recent ads have
celebrated the value of discount smokes, but mostly haven't
mentioned full-priced rivals.
   But with the big success of discount brands like Liggett's
Pyramid, which entered the market in early 1989, other
cigarette makers have scrambled to get a piece of the action.
Suddenly, the market is glutted with cheap brands, and ad
spending has grown apace.
   If Sterling is the latest good news for consumers, it
poses risks for RJR. Industry insiders privately express
shock that RJR is almost going out of its way to imperil the
future of its core brands, which are far more profitable than
the cheapie smokes, for the sake of a short-term sales hit.
Once consumers are taught to buy on price, not image, there's
no going back, these sources say.
   "RJR is telling consumers not to buy on the basis of
image, but to buy on the basis of dollars," Mr. Popper says.
   RJR says it knows the risks of the campaign. But the
Winston-Salem, N.C., tobacco maker says it has taken great
pains to make Sterling a quality smoke that will create
brand-loyal consumers. And the company plays down the hazards
of cannibalizing its own full-price brands.
   "Anytime you bring a new product into a static market, you
have to draw the business from somebody else," an RJR Nabisco
spokeswoman says. "Granted, part of that is probably going to
come from your existing stable of brands." But she stresses
that RJR research shows that 70% of Sterling's smokers will
come from people who are now smoking a non-RJR brand.
   With Sterling, RJR seemingly has borrowed a page from
Liggett's marketing plan for Pyramid, which also uses
comparative advertising. "They're even more impressive when
you discover they cost 40% less than Winston," one Pyramid ad
says. (Since Liggett commands only a tiny share of the
full-price cigarette market, its decision to use the
high-risk comparison strategy makes good sense.)
   Another potential problem facing Sterling is that, despite
its boastful advertising, it simply isn't the best deal
going. Although it's about $3 a carton cheaper than regular
cigarettes, the "sub-generics" like Pyramid and American
Brands' Montclair brand are some $5 dollars cheaper.
   Larry Turner, a stockbroker in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says it
doesn't appear to him that RJR is offering much of an
incentive for smokers to switch to Sterling. Just last month,
after 22 years of smoking Winston, he and his wife both
switched to Montclair. "I'm not too excited about trying
Sterling if it's $2 {a carton} higher than Montclair," he
says. "There's no reason to."

   Mattel Reviews Europe
                                                                                                       

   Mattel has put its European advertising account up for
review. Currently, J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather,
both units of WPP Group, are the giant toy maker's major
agencies in Europe. Billings on the account couldn't be
learned.
   A Mattel spokesman confirmed the review and said it plans
a decision this fall. The spokesman declined to say what
prompted the review, but industry aides cited the arrival of
a new top international executive as one reason.
   It isn't clear what agencies will be involved in the
review.
   Mattel's U.S. account, which is split between Ogilvy and
Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, isn't affected by the review.
