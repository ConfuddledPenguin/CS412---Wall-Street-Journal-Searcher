   Sikorsky Aircraft, which has been trying to pick up more
business overseas, said the South Korean government selected
it to co-produce Black Hawk helicopters with Korean Air.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but industry sources close to the
deal put its value at "in excess of $500 million" to the
United Technologies Corp. unit over about five years.

   Between 80 and 100 choppers are expected to be produced,
with the Koreans taking an increasingly larger role in the
manufacture of the aircraft as the project goes on. Black
Hawks, the U.S. Army's front-line, medium-lift
troop-transport helicopters, typically sell for about $7
million to $8 million each domestically.
   A Sikorsky spokesman declined to provide any specifics of
the pact, and a spokesman for Korean Air in Los Angeles said
details weren't immediately available. Military attache
officials at the Korean Embassy in Washington couldn't be
reached.
   Paul Nisbet, aerospace analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities, said the Korean government had negotiated the
contract first with the manufacturer, rather than putting it
out to bid, which is the usual process. At one point, though,
the Koreans gave at least informal consideration to a model
of the Huey-Cobra, made by Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter
division, according to industry sources.
   Eugene Buckley, president of Sikorsky, said the approval
marked another "major milestone" in the company's efforts to
increase its international market share. It was announced in
conjunction with the aerospace industry's big annual air
show, which is being held this week in Farnborough, England.
   The negotiations on the helicopter agreement apparently
took a number of months to settle. Korean Air, parent of the
nation's flag-carrier airline, was recently designated by the
Korean government as one of the three companies that will
build aircraft as part of a consolidation of that nation's
aerospace industry.
   Korean Air, itself a unit of the conglomerate Hanjin
Group, has assembled several hundred light helicopters and is
involved in the manufacture of jet fighters. It also makes
parts for Boeing Co.'s 747-400 passenger jet, as well as
McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-80 and MD-11 airliners.
   Late last year, Seoul said it would buy or co-produce 120
McDonnell Douglas F/A18 strike fighters in an arrangement
valued at $3 billion. The Black Hawk program is part of
Korea's force improvement effort. The baseline aircraft will
be the standard U.S. Army UH-60L helicopter with
T700-GE-701-C engines; the avionics will be tailored to
Korean specifications.
