   Magna International Inc. said it presented lenders with a
plan to reduce and restructure its debt.
   The Markham, Ontario, auto parts maker said its long-term
and short-term debt totaled 1.1 billion Canadian dollars
(US$949 million) March 31.

   It didn't elaborate on other elements of the plan, but
said it included debt reduction of about C$400 million
through July 1991, mostly through asset sales and turning
some operations into joint ventures.
   Magna said sales and joint ventures already arranged will
generate C$184 million. It said other divestitures are
expected to generate about C$150 million more.
   Magna said in March it was in technical default on some
loans. It had a C$203 million net loss on $1.41 billion of
revenue in the nine months ended April 30 after taking a
second-quarter charge of C$153 million to write down
unprofitable operations.
   The company said its asset sales would leave it with about
100 factories and "capacity" for more than C$2.5 billion in
annual sales. Magna said results have improved recently,
leading to a "small" operating profit in May and June.
