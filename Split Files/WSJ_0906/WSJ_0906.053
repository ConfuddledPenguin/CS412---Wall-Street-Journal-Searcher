   How would the U.S. government and the American people
react if the following nightmarish scenario materialized?
   The U.S. is at the brink of war with an adversary armed
with a terrifyingly lethal weapon -- one capable of
inflicting massive military and civilian casualties. So
frightening is this weapon that its possession has been
globally banned by international agreement. As a result, the
U.S. does not possess an in-kind deterrent to the use of such
a weapon against its forces or people; worse yet, it lacks
virtually any capability to minimize the devastation the
enemy might inflict by that use.

   Does this sound too awful to be plausible? Unfortunately,
the U.S. faces just such a prospect today in the threat posed
by Iraq's potential for biological warfare and America's
vulnerability to such an attack. Amid the feverish
speculation about the risk of an Iraqi chemical attack, this
weapon in Saddam Hussein's deadly bag of tricks has received
altogether too little attention.
   In 1972, the U.S. and virtually every other civilized
nation signed the Biological Weapons Convention, which
prohibits the development, stockpiling and use of biological
arms. In accordance with the convention's terms, the U.S. has
none of these terrible weapons that kill through the use of
various strains or combinations of toxic viruses, some
capable of replicating and spreading extremely rapidly.
   This is so even though powerful evidence exists that
others around the world, notably the Soviet Union and Iraq,
have proceeded to acquire biological weapon capabilities,
notwithstanding the convention. In fact, within the past few
weeks, the Soviet newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta disclosed
that a notorious accident in Sverdlovsk was -- as the Reagan
administration long maintained -- an "accident" in the Soviet
biological warfare program.
   In the face of such evidence, it is nothing less than
scandalous that the U.S. government has failed for more than
15 years to conduct meaningful research even into defensive
measures required to detect, type and neutralize the effects
of lethal biological warfare. As a result, there is now
little more than a vestigial -- indeed, pathetic -- program
in place for protecting Americans against biological weapon
attacks.
   Most terrifying of all, with the dawn of the era of
genetic engineering, even nations with relatively
unsophisticated technology bases can acquire toxic viruses
that defy ready classification, require complex antidotes --
if any exist -- and can penetrate the charcoal filtration
systems of the best protective equipment.
   For years, American policy makers have treated the growing
menace of noncompliance with the Biological Weapons
Convention with benign neglect. The crisis with Iraq makes
obvious what should have been understood all along: Such a
policy is irresponsible and potentially disastrous.
   If the U.S. chooses for moral or other reasons to remain
bound by the Biological Weapons Convention's prohibition on
possessing offensive biological weapons -- effectively
denying itself on a unilateral basis an in-kind deterrent --
it must at the very least now undertake a crash program of
research into technologies associated with detecting, typing
and defending against biological warfare.
   The U.S. must also avoid the present temptation to repeat
the mistakes inherent in the Biological Weapons Convention.
Completing a new and utterly unverifiable treaty banning
chemical weapons -- as the Bush administration is determined
to do -- will simply add yet another technology to the list
of biological and toxin weapons possessed by renegade
nations, but not by those that abide by international
agreements.
   What is more, the present danger that Saddam might employ
biological weapons (or, for that matter, any of the other
instruments of genocide at his disposal) against the forces
or people of the U.S. or those of friendly nations is just
one more argument for taking urgent steps to eliminate this
threat. Saddam in the past has shown no hesitation in using
genocidal weapons. Thousands of Kurds within Iraq, who were
the victims of his chemical warfare, can attest to that.
   As Sen. Richard Lugar (D., Ind.), a senior member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and respected authority on
international affairs, observed last week: "I think {if
Saddam Hussein merely takes his troops and leaves Kuwait, it
would} leave us in a very unsatisfactory situation. . . .
Saddam Hussein must either leave {office} or be removed.
Likewise, {his} nuclear facilities and . . . chemical
facilities should be destroyed."
   Iraq's unprovoked aggression has created a unique
opportunity and compelling justification for carrying out
Sen. Lugar's prescription. Accordingly, President Bush should
immediately issue an ultimatum to the government of Saddam
Hussein. It should require within 48 hours:
   -- The immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from and
relinquishing of Baghdad's control over Kuwait.
   -- An agreement to destroy within 30 days and under
international supervision all biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons-related facilities and stockpiles and
ballistic missile sites.
   -- The immediate release of all Western nationals now
being held hostage.
   Such an ultimatum may encourage Iraqi opposition elements
to remove Saddam if he refuses to comply. Absent Iraqi
compliance, however, the U.S. (and such allied forces as are
willing to participate) should move swiftly and with deadly
effect against his regime, its power base and particularly
its lethal arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.
