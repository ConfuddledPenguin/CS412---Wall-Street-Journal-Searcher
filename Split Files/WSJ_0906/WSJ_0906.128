   NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. -- The Federal Trade Commission and
Arco Chemical Co. agreed to settle antitrust litigation over
the company's proposed $220 million acquisition of certain
assets of Union Carbide Corp.
   Under a provisional consent agreement, Arco Chemical,
which is 83%-owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., Los Angeles,
will divest itself of the propylene glycols business it
agreed to buy from Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn. Propylene
glycol is used in products including fiberglass, paints and
cosmetics.

   Arco Chemical will retain a urethane polyols business to
be acquired from Carbide. But it will divest itself of a
so-called tolling arrangement whereby Texaco Chemical Co., a
unit of Texaco Inc., produces polyols that Arco Chemical then
sells. Urethane polyols are used in making polyurethane
cushions, among other things.
   Arco Chemical will waive provisions in previous agreements
under which Carbide and Texaco agreed not to compete in the
polyol and propylene glycol business. Arco Chemical also will
drop certain objections it had raised to a technology that
Texaco Chemical Co. has been developing to make propylene
oxide. Arco Chemical had questioned whether some of its own
technology was being used by Texaco Chemical, but a patent
infringement suit hadn't been filed. Texaco Chemical doesn't
yet make commercial quantities of propylene oxide.
   The propylene oxide market, whose derivatives end up in
many consumer products, wasn't directly involved in Arco
Chemical's agreement with Carbide. But the Carbide lines to
be acquired by Arco Chemical are big buyers of propylene
oxide, and Arco Chemical is a big producer. The Arco
Chemical-Carbide transaction would thus remove a buyer from
the market and, the FTC argued, act as a deterrent to new
sellers who would have competed for that business.
   Carbide will keep the full $220 million payment made by
Arco Chemical under terms of its original agreement with Arco
Chemical.
   Carbide and Arco Chemical each will pay $1 million to the
federal government as settlement of certain issues related to
the timeliness with which the companies filed information
about their transaction. The payment doesn't represent
admission of wrongdoing by either company.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Arco
Chemical rose 25 cents to $34, while Carbide fell 25 cents to
$16.125.
