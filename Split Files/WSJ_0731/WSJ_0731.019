   Ball Corp. took a big step in its effort to develop a
"more global" focus, by reaching a definitive agreement to
pay $1.03 billion in cash and stock for the European
operations of Continental Can Co.
   Continental Can is a unit of Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc., an
Omaha mining and construction concern. Under the pact, Kiewit
will receive $625 million in cash, and $400 million in Ball
common and preferred stock -- representing a 29% voting stake
in the Muncie, Ind.-based packaging concern.

   Ball, which has said previously it wants to widen its
international operations, said yesterday it sees "major
strategic opportunities" in the expansion of its currently
small presence in Europe.
   The European packaging market, "and in particular the
beverage can market," Ball said, "is positioned for
significant growth" because of factors including the
reduction in national trade barriers scheduled for 1992, and
the opening of Eastern Bloc markets.
   Continental Can Europe, the region's third-largest
packaging manufacturer, had sales last year of $1.47 billion;
while the unit is profitable, earnings weren't disclosed.
With about 10,000 employees at 32 manufacturing sites in the
United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany,
the operation concentrates in metal containers for food,
beverages and other general containers. It also has interests
in plastic containers.
   Ball "has paid a high price to enter the European market,"
said Rothschild Inc. analyst Jerry Melin, in a reference to
the sales-to-price ratio Ball has agreed to. "From a
long-term strategic perspective," he said, "it's good they
moved into the European market." But after listening to a
Ball presentation yesterday, Mr. Melin said he thinks the
company is at this point "unclear what it is they bought."
   Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben analyst Timothy Burns told Dow
Jones Professional Report, however, that the European
operations are a "crown jewel" whose planned acquisition
represents "outstanding" news.
   Kiewit acquired what was then known as Continental Group
Inc. in 1984, for $2.9 billion, then sold off a number of
non-container operations to pay down the debt. In two
separate transactions, it sold U.S. and Canadian operations
to Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co. for a total $636 million.
   Ball is perhaps best known for the glass preserving-jars
it began manufacturing more than a century ago, but such
products, at 3% of sales, are now overshadowed by its metal
beverage-can operation, which last year provided 58% of
sales. Ball's remaining operations are in diverse aerospace
and industrial markets.
   In 1989, pinched by a competitive can market, the company
reported net income of $35.8 million, or $1.44 a share, on
sales of $1.22 billion. Analysts expect those earnings to
strengthen in the current year as can prices improve.
   Ball said that, in addition to the cash, it will issue
$200 million of common stock, $129 million of voting
convertible exchangeable preferred, and $71 million of a
nonvoting form of the preferred. The company decided to
finance the purchase "with a significant amount of equity so
that we wouldn't be financially constrained from pursuing the
growth prospects of the business, which appear to be
excellent," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard
M. Ringoen.
   The company said it anticipates a "fairly rapid reduction"
in the financial leverage the deal will create.
   The planned acquisition is subject to approval by Ball
shareholders, as well as clearance by certain U.S. and
foreign regulators.
   Ball also announced yesterday that it will pay $65 million
to buy the remaining 50% interest in its Ball-InCon joint
venture from partner Holland American Investment Corp. The
company said it expects the profitable operation, which had
sales of $536 million last year, to "provide good cash flow."
   Under accounting rules, the venture's sales haven't
previously appeared in the company's totals, and Ball's sales
will now be swollen by the addition in future years of the
operation's sales. Ball said it expects both transactions to
close by year's end.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
shares of thinly traded Ball inched up 25 cents, to close at
$32.75.
