   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund approved a
$41 million loan to Honduras to support economic adjustments
in the Central American country during the next 12 months.
   Honduras qualified for the IMF financial assistance after
paying overdue loans.

   The IMF noted that Honduras also cleared up its loan
arrears to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank in late June and early July and thus has regained
eligibility for new credits from all three international
agencies.
