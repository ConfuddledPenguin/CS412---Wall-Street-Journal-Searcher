   London -- Henry Tate, the Victorian collector for whom
London's Thameside museum of British and 20th-century art is
named, made a mint in sugar cubes. It was perhaps in homage
to him that for as long as anyone could remember, the rooms
in which his collection was housed had the compressed and
boxy atmosphere of his invention. But earlier this year, in a
major renovation and rehang of the Tate Gallery, all
partitions and false ceilings were banished to reveal a
splendid and airy structure. And the Tate's director,
Nicholas Serota, has replaced the famously incomprehensible
patchwork that was the old installation with a chronological
hang that allows viewers to see the sweep of British art, and
its development within the context of European and American
art, in a beautifully simple loop around the building.
   Before, the collection of "Historic British" works, which
begins with a signed 1545 portrait of a man "made by John
Bettes, Englishman," was an island of dutiful pilgrimage off
the mainland of "International Modern," which occupied the
rest of the gallery. The British contribution to the latter
was consigned to marginal galleries, giving the (arguably
correct) impression that modern art was foreign art. With
chronology rather than the provenance of school or nation
dictating the contiguity between rooms, we now see Stanley
Spencer next to Mondrian, Paul Nash alongside dada and
surrealism and David Bomberg flanked by Italian futurists on
one side and Pierre Bonnard on the other.

   Though Britain does not often benefit from such
comparisons, it is fascinating to see how radically different
these simultaneous achievements were, and elsewhere to
discover cross-fertilizations that were lost when one had to
crisscross the museum between chicken and egg.
   Just as sugar cubes must have been controversial when Mr.
Tate introduced them, these accessible and streamlined
galleries, which will seem merely serene to future
generations, are the result of some radical thinking. There
is no pop art on display (which means that the gallery's most
visited painting, David Hockney's "Portrait of Mr. and Mrs.
Ossie Clark With Percy," is in storage). There is no St. Ives
painting, nor any by the Camden Town or Euston Road groups.
If this suggests that English art -- which it is one of the
galleries principal jobs to represent -- is getting
shortchanged, the opposite is true.
   Bloomsbury and vorticism, which previously appeared only
as a local variant of cubism, now get a room of their own.
But the radical thinking lies not in the burying of Andy
Warhol; it rests in Mr. Serota's policy of giving us a break
once in a while, every nine months to be precise. As the
museum becomes more like a gallery, with "new" exhibitions
culled from its own collection, favorites will return with
freshness in new configurations. Mr. Serota clearly believes
that the gallery's job is not just to preserve and make
available the nation's treasure, but to instruct and to
surprise.
   The first exhibition in the new Tate, "On Classic Ground:
Picasso, Leger, de Chirico and the New Classicism 1910-1930"
(until Sept. 2), also has re-education as an aim. So you
thought classicism had to do with the glories of Greece and
the grandeur of Rome? With some idea that beauty lies in the
harmonious proportion of the parts of the body and not in the
irregularities that make them so fetching? To be sure,
wavy-haired maidens in lace-up sandals and drapery abound in
this show, but they are the earthbound, thick-limbed peasant
girls of Catalonia and Provence. Greco-Roman sculpture does
appear in the background of canvases by de Chirico, Matisse,
Braque, Severini, Mario Sironi and Ubaldo Oppi; but
classicism in these rooms might as easily signify a debt,
both in imagery and in approach, to secondary sources -- to
Poussin, Ingres, Corot and, above all, to Cezanne.
   Unlike the academicians, with their slavishly copied and
therefore kitsch appurtenances of antiquity, the exhibited
artists have preferred to honor the values of classicism.
Guillaume Apollinaire's assessment of Andre Derain could
apply to the others on display, who "owed so much to the
ancients yet {whose} work bears not a trace of archaism."
   Picasso, as usual, emerges as the most robust
practitioner. In his paintings of monolithic women, perhaps
with a child or an overflowing amphora, the "return to
order," in Jean Cocteau's catch phrase of the period, clearly
involved an adherence to classical notions of harmony, the
harmony in composition, in nature, in mythological images,
but these concerns are always subordinate to the most urgent
claims of a purely plastic art.
   Owing as much to the golden life as to the golden section,
the notion of classicism celebrated in this show is
identified by the curators, Elizabeth Cowling and Jennifer
Mundy, as uniquely Mediterranean. There, they argue, "the
classical tradition was the native tradition -- the heritage
and source by natural right." So we get the rare chance to
see the Spaniards -- not just Picasso, Juan Gris and Dali but
some weird naive early landscapes by Miro, paintings by the
sculptor Julio Gonzalez, and works by Joaquim Sunyer, Jose
Clara, Manolo and Josep de Togores, among others. But there
are serious omissions, such as the influential painter and
theorist Joaquin Torres Garcia, who was then concerned with
neo-classicism and a central figure in Barcelona. And,
particularly as the catalog points to Nietzsche as a crucial
figure in the debate over classicism, the exclusion of the
Germans would seem to need a better explanation than the fact
that they didn't live enough in the sun. Although nefarious
uses of classicism are ostensibly kept out of this
exhibition, there is something ominous in the early works of
a few of the Italians, notably of Sironi, who was becoming an
exemplary fascist; for the rest we part with them in 1930, in
their olive groves with their ripe fruit and riper women,
feeling, as we leave, the chill of the impending expulsion
from Arcadia later in the decade.
   It will seem churlish to leap from that expulsion to a
discussion of the recent removal of the Courtauld Institute
to its luxurious new home in Somerset House. But anyone who
remembers the old, desperately inadequate fifth-floor
galleries in Woburn Square may nevertheless now wish to
breathe a nostalgic sigh. The galleries were so well hidden,
and opening hours so inconvenient, that you often would find
yourself alone in this wonderful collection, which includes
such masterpieces as Manet's "Le Dejeuner sur L'Herbe,"
Cezanne's "Card Players," Van Gogh's "Self-Portrait With a
Bandaged Ear," and Cranach's "Adam and Eve." The move to
Somerset House, a massive Georgian government building with a
Palladian facade (the $15 million refurbishment of which cost
10 times that of the Tate), means that nearly all of the
collection, including Goyas and Botticellis that have been in
storage will be on display together for the first time. The
Adamesque interiors -- turquoise walls foaming with
decorative patches of white wedding-cake plasterwork --
certainly are impressive. In a lesser collection they would
be welcomed in the category of added interest. But, with what
the Courtauld's got, they are distracting. One longs to see
masterpieces, well-lit and in plenty of space, on a
background of cool cream.
   It may be that the re-education has been successful: Our
way of looking at art has been so changed by places as
serious and serene as the Tate that the chaotic rococco of
the Courtauld can now seem to trivialize great works; it may
be a simple longing to see them. In the resolutely old-world
environment of even the new Courtauld, pictures compete with
carpets, furniture and ornate window frames; they are still
stuck up high over doorways and between flimsy temporary
dividers with "interesting" displays of the wonders revealed
by infrared reflectographs; many are behind reflecting glass;
and none of the money seems to have been spent on what was
most urgently needed: good lighting. Still, we must resist
defeat by imperfect viewing conditions -- whether the
interference comes from curatorial terminology or from
upholstery -- for all we can ever do is look, squint and try
to see.
