   WASHINGTON -- The House approved an $8.3 billion
military-construction bill that would slash the Pentagon's
budget for overseas facilities by more than 60% and bar any
expenditures for a new NATO air base in southern Italy in
fiscal 1991.
   Total U.S. contributions for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's infrastructure would be cut by 41% from
current levels. The debate was testimony to the realignment
in Europe and political pressure in the U.S. to protect
parochial interests in the face of defense-spending
reductions.

   "Europe has taken us to the cleaners for a long time,"
said Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.). And North Carolina Rep. Bill
Hefner, chairman of the military construction subcommittee,
derisively compared the past American posture as "Uncle
Sugar." A committee compromise, delaying any decision on the
new Crotone air base in Italy, dissolved in the face of floor
opposition, and by a simple voice vote, members chose to
freeze all U.S. contributions for the base at least through
the next fiscal year.
   NATO commander Gen. John Galvin personally lobbied on
behalf of the facility as a new home for an F-16 fighter wing
that is losing its base in Spain. But critics argued that it
would be better to bring the unit home than to invest further
U.S. dollars in Europe. Sensing defeat, Bush administration
allies abandoned any attempt to force a roll call, and the
underlying bill passed easily by a 312-82 margin.
   The defeat for the administration came as senior members
of the Senate Appropriations Committee signaled their
opposition to the Justice Department's ambitious plans for a
new National Drug Intelligence Center.
   Drug czar William Bennett is seeking an initial $46
million for the center through a special fund within the
White House budget. But critics argue that once begun, the
project will be a financial burden on the Justice Department
and disruptive of drug intelligence operations.
   The issue will first be tested in a Treasury and Postal
Service bill slated to be drafted this week. And, in an
unusual step, the chairman and ranking Republican on the
Justice appropriations subcommittee have written their
colleagues asking that Mr. Bennett's request be denied. "Is
this the best option for improving drug intelligence
activities?" asked Sens. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and
Warren Rudman (R., N.H.).
   They added: "It is an option which we feel well may prompt
an interruption in ongoing drug-intelligence operations,
duplicate existing intelligence activities, and ultimately
produce marginal returns given the costs incurred."
   The military-construction measure yesterday is the 10th of
the 13 annual appropriations bills to be sent to pass the
House. The vote came as the full House Appropriations
Committee cleared a $1.75 billion legislative measure funding
the operations of the Capitol as well as such related
agencies as the Library of Congress and General Accounting
Office.
   One of the smallest of the annual bills, the legislative
measure also is one of the most nettlesome. Going into
November, lawmakers once again are torn over how to revise
the costly system of free mail afforded to incumbents.
   The measure includes an estimated $33.2 million to meet a
shortfall in funds for 1990, where expenditures have been
swollen by election-year mailing. And almost $59 million more
is provided for the new fiscal year.
   Republicans, sensing the political advantages for the
Democratic majority, are demanding new restrictions. But
within their own ranks, there are divisions as to how to
proceed.
   Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.), chairman of the legislative
subcommittee, has met criticism, too, in his own party for
moving toward limits, but he is expected to propose a formula
setting an average ceiling of approximately $160,000 per
member and requiring regular disclosure of expenditures, much
as members now report their office accounts.
