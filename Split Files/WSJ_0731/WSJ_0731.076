   NEW YORK -- Prospect Group Inc. will begin distributing
its assets to shareholders in August under its plan to
liquidate.
   The company, which has diverse interests, also said that
shares of Illinois Central Corp., which now trade in tandem
with Prospect's shares, will be separated and begin trading
on the national over-the-counter market Aug. 21, under the
symbol ICRR.

   Prospect's board said that the asset distributions are
payable Aug. 21 to shares of record Aug. 2. Prospect's
interests to be distributed include:
   -- Illinois Central. Each 6.7 shares of Prospect will
receive one additional share of the freight-railroad holding
company. In January, Prospect holders received one Illinois
Central share for each two Prospect shares.
   -- Forschner Group Inc. Each 10.3 shares of Prospect will
receive one share of the Shelton, Conn., marketer of
Victorinox Swiss Army Knives and Swiss Army cutlery products.
   -- Sylvan Foods Holdings Inc. Each 8.5 shares of Prospect
will receive one share of the Worthington, Pa., mushroom
producer.
   Prospect also will distribute $11.6 million of cash; each
Prospect share will receive about 50 cents in this payout.
   Yet to be distributed to Prospect holders are interests in
MidSouth Corp., a freight railroad based in Jackson, Miss.,
and Children's Discovery Centers of America Inc., a San
Rafael, Calif., child-care company. Prospect expects to
distribute its holdings of MidSouth by year end and of CDC in
1991; the ratios haven't been determined.
   For now, Prospect will retain its holdings of Recognition
Equipment Inc., a Dallas manufacturer of document-processing
equipment, and Noel Group Inc., a closely held New York firm
with energy and other interests.
   The company also will retain until a later date $25
million of cash plus interests in Ivy Insurance Group Inc., a
Pasadena, Calif., auto insurer; Ada Corp., a Dallas
building-materials concern; and National Spirit Group Inc., a
Dallas operator of cheerleader camps. In April, National
Spirit made a filing under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law.
