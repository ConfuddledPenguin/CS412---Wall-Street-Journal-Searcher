   Cyclops Industries Inc., citing lower prices on
flat-rolled steel products and charges related to a
previously announced restructuring, reported a second-quarter
net loss of $11.3 million, or $1.62 a share.
   In the same period a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based
steelmaker had a profit of $13 million, or $1.81 a share.
Sales fell 12% to $306.2 million from $348.8 million.

   Earlier, the company said it expected to report losses for
the quarter and the year as a result of restructuring its
specialty steel division and realigning certain carbon strip
operations.
   The restructuring involved separating its Cytemp Specialty
Steel division into two business units and phasing out
certain products. That action will result in the closing of a
Pittsburgh plant in the second half of this year, the company
said. Even without the restructuring charge, Cyclops said the
Cytemp division had a $5.3 million pretax loss for the first
six months of the year compared with a pretax operating
income of $5.3 million in the first six months of 1989.
