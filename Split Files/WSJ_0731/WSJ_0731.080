   Too Many Think the Bunny
   Is Duracell's, Not Eveready's

   High atop the list of America's favorite commercials this
year sits the Duracell battery campaign. Viewers can't seem
to get enough of the obnoxious pink bunny that "keeps on
going . . . and going . . . and going."
   But wait. The pink bunny commercial isn't for Duracell at
all. It's for Eveready's Energizer battery, the No. 2 brand.
The fact that survey respondents can't tell the difference
shows how even the most memorable ad may not do much for the
brand it's supposed to be selling. On the contrary, the ad
may inadvertently boost the competition: Duracell's market
share continues to grow while Eveready's has shrunk slightly,
according to A.C. Nielsen figures that Eveready disputes.

   The mass confusion over the bunny is painfully evident in
the first-quarter results of Video Storyboard Tests Inc.'s
annual survey of 4,700 viewers, which will be released this
week. Energizer ranks second in the latest survey thanks to
its annoying mechanical mascot. But so many people associated
the bunny with Duracell instead that it, too, was pushed into
the top 10, making its debut at an impressive No. 7.
   In fact, a full 40% of the people who named the bunny
commercial as the most outstanding ad were sure it was for
Duracell; only 60% correctly identified it as an Energizer
ad. "It's helping Duracell quite a lot," observes David
Vadehra, president of Video Storyboard. Eveready "should be
spending more time on the Energizer name, and less time on
the bunny."
   The Energizer mix-up isn't uncommon. When No. 2 brands
challenge their bigger rivals by mocking them in ads,
consumers often remember the ad, the product -- and the No. 1
brand name, rather than the name of the challenger. A few
years ago, the Video Storyboard survey found people
attributing a funny Philips light bulb campaign to market
leader General Electric. Respondents also confused an
Anheuser Busch ad that mocked the famous Miller Lite
retired-jocks-in-a-bar campaign.
   But Mr. Vadehra says he hasn't seen this much confusion
since 1979, when people were sure that the cloying James
Garner-Mariette Hartley camera campaign was for Kodak. The
ads were actually for Polaroid. He thinks the mass bunny
trouble stems from the fact that the Energizer ad is actually
mocking an earlier Duracell ad that also used a mechanical
bunny. There's a moral somewhere here: "If the No. 2 brand
tries to hitch onto the advertising associated with the
category leader," he says, "people are going to think this is
an ad for the category leader."
   Duracell, as one would expect, is perfectly happy to be
part of the confusion. After all, its ads never made it into
the top 10 on their own. It's even fielded a few letters from
consumers asking where they can get their very own pink
bunny. It sends back Duracell products instead. "We thank
Eveready for helping give us more impact from our advertising
budget," a spokesman says.
   But Bob Wolf, chairman and chief executive officer of
Chiat/Day/Mojo, which created the bunny campaign, says more
people are catching on that yes, the campaign is for
Eveready. "Inevitably, there's going to be a lag time before
people link {the bunny} to the actual product," he says. He
adds that the agency gets hundreds of letters about the
campaign, and that it hopes to link the Energizer name more
strongly with the bunny by picturing the bunny in store
displays and perhaps on packaging.
   "You're dealing with probably the lowest-interest category
in the world. Nobody cares about batteries except when they
stop working," he says bluntly. He adds, "What we've created
is a very memorable advertising campaign. If you can create
interest, that's when you get sales."
   Eveready, a unit of Ralston Purina, says the campaign is
working just fine. It goes even further than that: It
vigorously disputes Nielsen figures showing that Duracell is
the market leader, and that Eveready's market share has
slipped slightly since last year. Eveready's own internally
calculated figures show it as the undisputed market-share
leader.
   The Nielsen figures for March-April 1990 show Duracell as
the No. 1 brand, with 42.1% of all alkaline battery sales, up
from 40.1% a year earlier. Eveready, according to Nielsen,
had market share of 36.7% in the 1990 period, down slightly
from 37.3% in 1989. The Eveready spokesman says the Nielsen
figures are incomplete, because they don't take into account
sales at retailers such as discount outlets and hardware
stores. Nielsen declines to comment on the matter.
   Regardless of what the true numbers are, ad experts say
the perception is that Duracell is the market leader -- and
that's enough to confuse people when they see the Energizer
bunny. "If there's somebody else who is top of mind, you take
the risk that you're playing to the leader's strengths," says
Richard Winger, a consultant with Boston Consulting Group in
New York. "If you're the No. 2 brand, it's very risky."
