   ROCKVILLE, Md. -- An advisory panel to the Food and Drug
Administration postponed making any recommendation about the
use of Cetus Corp.'s interleukin-2 for advanced kidney
cancer.
   The panel sent Cetus back to its labs and computers to do
more analysis of its study data to pinpoint which patients
should receive the drug, also known as IL-2, and to come up
with more compelling evidence that the drug extends survival.
Kidney cancer that has metastasized, or spread from its
original site, is aggressive and generally fatal, and has no
approved therapy.

   Despite evidence that 15% of patients experienced tumor
shrinkage, and 4% enjoyed complete remission on IL-2, there
were lingering questions that troubled the panel about which
fraction of patients represented the likeliest candidates for
the arduous treatment. IL-2 can cause an array of side
effects including heavy fluid retention, with heart and lung
problems.
   The panel's action promises a delay of several months for
Cetus, which bases much of its hope for future profitability
on the product. In addition, a kidney cancer patients' lobby
has said it will campaign for IL-2's approval.
   Panel Chairman Jerome Groopman said the group was
wrestling with a question of "biblical complexity" -- how to
help the subset of patients who may gain a meaningful
reprieve on IL-2 without placing at risk those who cannot.
   "IL-2 is active, but it's not by any means a finished
product," added panel member Frederick Appelbaum, of the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.
   Although the advisory panel's decision was announced after
markets closed, Cetus stock fell yesterday in apparent
anticipation of the outcome, declining by $1.75 to close at
$14.125 a share in national over-the-counter trading.
   Peter Wiernik, a researcher from Albert Einstein Cancer
Center in New York City, had urged the panel recommend
approval based on "significant . . . extremely durable"
responses.
   "I would very much like to see this treatment become
available to patients on a wider basis," Dr. Wiernik said. He
argued that survival among IL-2 treated patients was
"significantly better" than survival among a group of
patients who had received another biological agent, beta
interferon.
   However, Jay Siegel of the FDA said the agency viewed that
comparison as invalid, because the patients on IL-2 were
younger, healthier and more likely to have received surgery
-- thus giving them a better prognosis even before they
received IL-2.
   Cetus said it was disappointed by the panel's inaction,
arguing that "this product can play a significant role in
altering the dismal prognosis of kidney cancer patients. It
is a tragedy that Americans don't have access to a drug
developed in the United States that is already approved and
being used in nine European countries."
   However, the panel's postponement came as no real
surprise, given the complexity of the problem and indications
that regulators were prepared to hold Cetus to the FDA's
tradition of requiring clear proof that patients gain a
longer and better life. So far, the panel noted, two patients
have remained in complete remission for more than two years,
but most such responses are temporary.
   "It's clear the majority of patients don't benefit" from
IL-2, declared panel member Robert Figlin of the University
of California at Los Angeles.
   Still, insisted another member, John Reinhart of Ohio
State University, "It's clear to me that this {IL-2} is the
most active agent against renal cell carcinoma."
   Dr.Groopman, the panel chairman, asked Cetus to identify
for the FDA which subgroup of kidney cancer patients
represent the drug's target population.
   Robert Kupor, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody in New York,
said the tenor of yesterday's debate presages both a delay
and a possibly narrower market for IL-2, even if it is
recommended for approval when the panel reconvenes. No date
has been set for that next meeting.
