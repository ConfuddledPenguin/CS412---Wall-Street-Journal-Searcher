   Fifteen years ago a group of faculty and students at
Harvard Medical School tried to formulate a model "living
will," although we knew that it would not be legally binding;
we could only hope that it might provide support for
sympathetic physicians. The recent Supreme Court decision in
the Cruzan case, confirming the legal force of such a
document, is a real step forward.
   Nevertheless, the decision was disappointing. The minority
(four justices) felt that the court should provide leadership
in dealing with the agony and the bankruptcy that heroic
medical treatment of such hopeless cases is forcing on
thousands of families. The majority (five justices), however,
focused on the constitutional aspects of the case, and it
upheld Missouri's right to require "clear and convincing"
evidence that the patient would have wished life support to
be terminated. At the same time, these justices were
evidently not altogether happy with the consequence of their
decision, for they expressed sympathy with the family's
position, and they saw no constitutional barrier to future
state laws that would accept less formal evidence than
Missouri now requires.

   Meanwhile, any who wish to avoid unwanted life support
will have to express the preference in advance, though the
requirement may be less formal in some states than in others.
The safest solution is a living will. But this mechanism is
unfortunately unlikely to be widely used outside a small,
highly educated fraction of the population. Moreover, even in
this group young people are the least likely to take formal
steps in anticipation of possible major brain damage,
although they are the ones most often involved in automobile
accidents. Even if we enlarge the coverage by moving toward
accepting less formal evidence, as the court expects, the
majority of cases might still end up in the same situation as
Nancy Cruzan today.
   We will therefore no doubt encounter increasing pressure
to find a more general solution. I would suggest that there
is one. Since by now essentially everyone is aware of the
problem, it would not be difficult to get a meaningful
estimate, in a survey or a referendum, of public attitudes
toward prolonged support of bodily life in clear cases of
irreversible loss of mental life. I suspect the fraction
opposed to such support would be very large. If so,
legislators and the courts would be justified in
reconsidering the current assumption: that in the absence of
a prior expression of individual preference we must presume
an interest of the individual, or the state, in continuing
life support, even with irreversible loss of consciousness.
   As an alternative to this presumption, we might decide
that in such extreme cases evidence of a prior request should
no longer be required for the termination of support. The
medical profession would then have the power, when the family
agrees, to remove such support. To ensure that this grave
decision be made responsibly we would need safeguards. Also,
some people would no doubt wish, for religious reasons or
from mistrust of medical predictions, to have their bodies
kept alive as long as possible under any circumstances. Their
desire should be respected. However, the burden of
demonstrating a preference would now be shifted to that
group.
   Permanent coma is one end of a wide range of impairments
that render people incompetent to express their wishes. Among
the less extreme cases, in which the individual retains some
degree of consciousness, one would not presume, in the
absence of a prior statement, an individual preference for
termination. This decision would continue to depend on prior
expression of that preference, or on appointment of a
surrogate to make the decision. But irreversible coma is so
clearly definable, as a special class, that it could be given
special treatment without starting on a slippery legal slope.
   This suggestion is not a radical response to a familiar
problem but a reasonable response to radical changes in
medical technology, and to growing public awareness of the
problems that these changes create. In an earlier time the
law naturally had a strong presumption in favor of sustaining
the body as long as possible, built on the feeling that while
there's life there's hope. Today, however, both aspects of
the problem have changed a great deal: We not only have
techniques for keeping the unconscious body alive for years
rather than days, but we also have much more reliable
techniques for assessing the extent and the irreversibility
of brain damage.
   In addition, the issue is a substantial part of a broader
set of problems that are increasingly gaining public
attention. Among our medical expenditures (12% of the gross
national product) is a large fraction devoted to prolonged
terminal care. The benefits are often exceedingly dubious
while the emotional and other costs are enormous -- and the
problem continues to grow. We will eventually have to come to
grips with it. And with respect to the moral aspects of
deciding how much, and by what mechanism, to limit medical
care, irreversible coma may be the simplest case that we will
have to face.
   When I attended medical school, in the 1930s, physicians
not only had much less power than now to keep terminally ill
bodies alive, but they also were allowed much more discretion
in the use of the powers that they had. The inevitability of
death was more readily accepted.
   Today we see large changes -- not only in medical
technology, but also in social attitudes, as reflected in the
establishment of committees to govern the use of human
subjects in medical research. And just as these committees
have been very effective, there is little reason to doubt
that placing decisions about the irreversible step of
terminating life support in the hands of such a committee,
rather than in those of the individual physician, would lead
to more reliable evaluation and greater public confidence.
The alternative, to maintain a conservative attitude and deny
the medical profession and the family all discretion in this
matter, harms the interests of all who are involved.
