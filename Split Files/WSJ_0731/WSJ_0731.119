   TORONTO -- Campeau Corp. withdrew a shareholder resolution
to authorize the sale of substantially all of its Canadian
real-estate assets, but said it still plans to sell roughly
two-thirds of the assets.
   The resolution was part of a package to restructure
Campeau Corp.'s ailing finances. Robert Campeau, chairman and
chief executive officer of Campeau Corp., said the resolution
was "premature" without first obtaining standstill agreements
from the company's two principal creditors, Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd. and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.

   As a result, Mr. Campeau said he opposed the resolution at
this time, leaving the company's management short of the
two-thirds majority necessary to pass the measure.
   The withdrawal of the resolution doesn't appear to
substantially change Campeau Corp.'s plans. Mr. Campeau said
shareholder approval would be sought at a later date if
management decides to sell more of the real-estate assets,
which carry a total book value of about $1 billion.
   Since Jan. 1, Campeau Corp. has raised $94 million from
the sale of Canadian real estate.
   The company had a net loss of $1.74 billion in the year
ended Jan. 31, mainly because of heavy financing costs and
write-downs related to its U.S. retailing operations, which
have sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
