   NEW YORK -- The stock market pulled out of a morning dive
and closed higher, with rising bond prices, strong oil issues
and program buying pulling blue-chip issues out of the
depths.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 18.82 to 2917.33.
Oil stocks led the rebound. Gains in Chevron, Exxon and
Texaco accounted for about half of the average's overall
advance.

   Rising oil prices hurt airline stocks, however. The Dow
Jones Transportation Average fell 9.67 to 1125.00. UAL's 6
1/8-point decline to 156 7/8 accounted for part of that move,
but most other airline shares were lower because investors
think higher fuel costs will erode their profits in the next
several months. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 7/8 to
55 3/4.
   But a 17-cent rise in September crude oil futures to
$20.21 a barrel had little effect on the Treasury bond
market, which typically falls when oil prices gush. Bonds
opened higher and kept climbing. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose nearly 7/8 of a point, or $8.75 for each
$1,000 face amount.
   Traders had trouble identifying the bond bulls. "If there
are people driving the market, it's not the foreign
investor," said George Gianaris, sales manager at Daiwa
Securities America. The yield advantage of a U.S. 10-year
note over a Japanese issue is about three-quarters of a
percentage point, the narrowest in years, "and that's before
you even start thinking about currency risk," Mr. Gianaris
said.
   Falling interest rates heightened the appeal of utility
stocks. The Dow Jones Utility Average gained 3.70 to 207.05,
its strongest rise since early June.
   One investment strategy at work in both the stock and bond
markets was asset allocation. Vince Bailey, vice president at
BEA Associates, said it isn't uncommon for managers of funds
that attempt to duplicate market indexes to put new money to
work at the end of a month. Also, a drop in money-market
rates and last week's stock-market decline is causing some
big money managers to shift from cash and bonds into stocks,
he said.
   So while asset allocators helped push benchmark indexes
up, many stocks not included in these measures lagged.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange were ahead of
advancing shares 792-717. And the over-the-counter market
sagged: The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.21, or 0.73%, to
439.38.
   "This wasn't institutional buying" in the stock market,
said Richard Meyer, head of equity trading at Ladenburg,
Thalmann &amp; Co. "This was buy programs and traders; the volume
shows that." New York Stock Exchange trading amounted to
146,470,000 shares, lighter than an average day.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks finished higher. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index gained 0.60%, compared with the Dow industrials' 0.65%
rise.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were higher. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond declined to 8.40% from 8.48%.
