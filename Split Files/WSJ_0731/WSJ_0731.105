   NEW YORK -- Bonds rallied yesterday as investors rehashed
old economic news and found new reasons to buy bonds.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose nearly 7/8
point yesterday, or $8.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, eased to 8.40%.

   The rally, which began during overnight trading in foreign
markets and spilled over into the U.S. trading session,
reflected follow-through enthusiasm to Friday's report on
gross national product.
   The GNP report revealed that the economy grew at an
inflation-adjusted annual rate of just 1.2% in the second
quarter. Economists who dissected the report, however, said
the economy was even weaker than the anemic growth rate would
suggest as nearly every major indicator of private economic
activity declined. Only a buildup in business inventories and
a rise in government spending kept the economy afloat.
   "As investors digested Friday's economic data, they became
increasingly convinced that interest rates will fall,"
without reviving inflation, said John Costas, comanager of
government trading at First Boston Corp.
   That's a big change in sentiment from early last week when
many investors believed that long-term interest rates could
not decline due to rising inflation expectations.
   Many investors reacted negatively when the Fed reduced the
short-term interest rates several weeks ago and they sharply
criticized Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who they believed was
abandoning the fight against inflation in favor of helping to
stave off recession. (Although bond investors like to see
interest rates fall, because it boosts the value of their
fixed-income portfolios, they worry that inadvertent easing
can stimulate inflation, which they loathe because it reduces
the value of their holdings.)
   But after taking a close look at the GNP report, "the
concerns about Mr. Greenspan and his credibility have been
pushed aside," said James Capra, a senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. "Last week,
investors were worried about inflation," because "it appeared
that the Fed was easing into a sluggish, but not a
recessionary economy. This week, the perception is that the
Fed was easing into an economy that is on the verge of
recession and that is not a inflationary move."
   Yesterday's rally came against a backdrop of several
negative factors, analysts said.
   For starters, Japanese interest rates spurted higher
overnight with the Japanese government's bellwether 10-year
bond hitting a new seven-year high of 7.645% before
retreating to 7.63%. Higher Japanese bond yields have often
pulled U.S. yields higher.
   Another would-be negative for the U.S. bond market was the
weaker dollar. But it, too, was ignored.
   Looking ahead, the next big date on the economic calendar
is Friday, when the July employment report will be released.
   There is some speculation that a sharp slowdown in new
jobs growth could convince the Fed to ease policy again.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
103 20/32 to yield 8.40% compared with 102 26/32 to yield
8.48% on Friday. Two-year notes ended at a price of 100 3/32,
up from 100 (or par value) on Friday. The issue's yield eased
to 7.93% from 7.98%.
   The Treasury sold $18.5 billion of Treasury bills
yesterday at its regular weekly auction. The average discount
rate on the three-month bills was 7.50% and the average
discount rate on the six-month bills was 7.37%.
   The rate on the three-month bill was up from last week's
auction when it was 7.49% and the rate on the six-month bill
was down from last week's auction when it was 7.40%.
   The average discount rate for the three-month bills was
the highest since the average of 7.62% at the July 16
auction. The rate on six-month bills was the lowest since
7.30% at Dec. 4 auction.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated Aug. 2. The 13-week bills mature
Nov. 1, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Jan. 31, 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Falling interest rates continued to pump life into an
otherwise lethargic corporate-debt market.
   About $750 million in new debt securities, ranging in
maturity from four to five years, was priced Monday. Among
the highlights: $300 million offering of five-year notes by
General Motors Acceptance Corp., a unit of General Motors
Corp. The noncallable securities were priced to yield 8.84%
through underwriters led by First Boston Corp.
   Also in the market Monday was Avco Financial Services
Inc., a unit of Textron Inc., which offered $100 million of 4
1/2-year notes priced to yield 8.95%.
   Ron Bukow, chief financial officer at Avco, said that the
finance company was drawn to the market because of the
general improvement in rates that has taken place over the
last few weeks.
   He said the company, which has between $200 million to
$300 million of financing left to do this year, will use
proceeds from yesterday's offering to refinance
commercial-paper borrowings.
   "There's about a (1 percentage point) differential between
commercial paper and intermediate term rates now," said Mr.
Bukow. "It's a little higher than it's been in the past but
it's still a relatively small premium to pay for longer-term
financing."
   Three other corporate borrowers, Westinghouse Credit
Corp., a unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp.; Salomon Inc.
and Norwest Financial Inc., a unit of Norwest Corp., tapped
the corporate debt market yesterday.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds lagged U.S. Treasury securities, posting
gains of about 3/8 point.
   Meanwhile, in the junk-bond market, high-yield bonds, or
securities that carry low credit ratings or no credit ratings
at all, ended the day unchanged in thin trading.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended unchanged to as much as 3/4 point
higher, with the market showing a firm tone amid light
trading.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were 1/8 higher
at par and the Florida Board of Education's 7.25% issue of
2023 were 3/4 point higher at 101 1/4 to yield 7.14%.
   The market's firm tone and bullish price movement is
expected to carry over into today's session, traders said.
   No large new municipal issues were priced during the
session.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage- Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended sharply higher.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for August delivery were up 15/32 at 100 1/2 to yield 9.56%.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were up
14/32 at 99 26/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association
9.5% securities were up 14/32 at 100 14/32.
   The primary market was dormant.
   Longer-term securities outperformed short-term issues.
However, should the market resume its steepening yield curve
-- with short-term rates falling faster than bond yields --
traders anticipate a pick-up in issuance of real estate
mortgage investment conduits. A large chunk of a Remic
offering is concentrated in the short maturities,
consequently a steepening yield curve tends to stimulate
Remic origination.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The sell-off in Japan's government bond market extended
into its third trading day with some bond yields climbing to
new seven-year highs.
   Even though the value of the yen rose against the U.S.
dollar and the Bank of Japan, the central bank, added funds
to the money market -- actions that usually strengthen the
credit markets -- bond prices continued to fall. Traders said
the absence of buyers exacerbated yesterday's decline.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was 85.03,
down 0.32 point, to yield 7.63%. (When calculated using the
semiannual compound method, the closing yield on the No. 119
was 7.10% yesterday, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   In the past 10 days, the yield on the benchmark bond has
climbed 0.435 percentage point from 7.195%. Japanese bond
yields have been rising for months due to inflation
expectations and in response to moves by the Bank of Japan to
push up short-term rates.
   In West Germany, the story yesterday was supply. First,
the East German finance ministry took in 3.64 billion marks
($2.26 billion) through the sale of zero-coupon bills. In
addition, Staatsbank Berlin, the legal successor to East
Germany's now-defunct central bank, sold 5 billion marks of
floating rate notes.
   Today and tomorrow West Germany is expected to sell
between 6 billion and 8 billion marks of 10-year bonds. The
rate on the new issue is expected to be 8.5%.
   In trading, West German bonds were modestly higher.
