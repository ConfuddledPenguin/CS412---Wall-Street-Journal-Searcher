   EXECUTIVE BONUSES shrink on profit slide. But total pay
still climbs.
   Top managers at 125 industrial corporations saw bonuses
paid at the beginning of this year for 1989 performances
decline 2.4% from the year before, to an average $165,200,
consultant Hay Group says. The executives, even so, still are
going to end up this year with $518,300 in total cash
compensation, a 4.4% rise from 1989, because their base
salaries this year are up 7.8%, to an average $353,100.
That's an increase that sounds caution signals for Ira Kay,
Hay's director of compensation consulting.

   Shareholder interests might be better served by putting
some of the money used to fund base-pay increases into
"long-term-incentive opportunities," such as stock options,
he says. This year's 4.4% increase in total compensation,
though, is the slimmest for the top executives since 1985,
when their cash packages edged up less than 3%. Last year,
with whopping bonuses, total compensation climbed 9.7% from
1988.
   Midlevel executives see even smaller raises than their
bosses: 5% in base pay and 4.3% in total compensation.
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYEE-BENEFIT COSTS rose 5.9% in past year, paced by
health insurance.
   Private employers paid for each worker an average of $4.13
an hour in March for employee benefits, atop the $10.84 an
hour paid in wages, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. The
benefits -- including vacations, supplemental pay, all
insurance, retirement plans and Social Security -- came to
27.6% of total compensation, up from 27.3% in March 1989 and
26.8% in March 1987.
   Insurance, which mostly means health coverage, accounted
for much of the rise. Companies paid on average 92 cents an
hour to cover workers, up 8.2% from the year before and up
nearly 28% from 1987. Social Security posted the second
sharpest rise, costing employers 89 cents for each hour
worked, up 19% from 1987.
                                                                                                       

   COMPANIES TARGET catastrophic illnesses in bid to curb
soaring health cost.
   With evidence mounting that only a few cases account for a
huge slice of employer medical-benefits bills, companies seek
to control costs by looking for ways to head off catastrophes
before they come to pass. The incentives are clear enough. A
University of Michigan study at Steelcase Inc. finds that
only 10% of its employees account for 66% of its health-care
bill. Another Midwest manufacturer says 1% of its workers are
responsible for 20% of its cost.
   At International Paper Corp., where seven claims in a
9,000-member union group topped $200,000 each last year, the
company moves to limit exposure caused by life-style
excesses, with extra charges or increased deductibles for
workers who smoke, are overweight, don't wear seatbelts or
drive while intoxicated. Philip Morris Cos. steers workers to
staff doctors. Quaker Oats Co. runs wellness and prenatal
classes.
   General Mills figures each program dollar returns $3 in
reduced absenteeism and lower health-care bills.
                                                                                                       

   SEN. DAVID PRYOR's proposed Employee Benefits
Simplification Act draws some shrugs. The bill redefines
compensation and rewrites rules covering distributions into
IRAs. But the measure "doesn't go far enough," says Philip
Bosco of CPAs Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   WORKERS WORRY MORE about dependents. One in four calls to
Managed Health Network deals with emotional problems of
subscriber spouses and children, up from only one in 20 two
years ago.
                                                                                                       

   THEY'RE ALL TIED. Workers who smoke and don't wear
seatbelts are willing to be paid less than others for job
risks, Joni Hersch of the University of Wisconsin and W. Kip
Viscusi of Duke conclude.
                                                                                                       

   WRONG TARGET? Half the manufacturers that say they have
productivity problems trace the difficulty to "people," CPAs
Grant Thornton says. But 38% list plant investments as their
primary response. Only 24% cite investments in people.
                                                                                                       

   FORGET SPECIALIZING. Getting ahead now requires
"generalist" training.
   Students believe it; a survey by consultant Right
Associates finds that college students say more than 2 to 1
that the route to the top requires skills in many areas
rather than in-depth training in one specialized field. And,
for once, their elders agree. "Pick something you can put
110% into," even if it has nothing to do with your career
plan, advises Karen Horn, chief executive of Bank One. "The
ability to put 110% into something is very valued in the
business world," she explains.
   At Chevron USA, says Willis Price, president, "we're
moving from technical expertise and scholastic excellence to
a broader profile." Albert Ondis, Astro-Med Inc.'s CEO, says
today's students must develop skills that can be "recycled"
as careers change. Team Bank Chairman Ronald Steinhart, with
degrees in accounting and finance, urges liberal-arts courses
on his three sons. Leonard Jaskol, CEO of Lydall Inc.,
suggests training in logic.
   But Gene Bell of Pacific Telesis argues "you've got to
understand technology, no matter what job you have."
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Sometimes it takes an earthquake. Only one
in five companies nationally has a formal policy for helping
workers cope with natural disasters. But half the West Coast
firms have or are considering such a plan, Adia Personnel
Services says. . . . We know, we know. National Seminars'
list of difficult people includes "the know-it-all," "the
fake know-it-all," "the bull," "the whiner" and "the fox."
