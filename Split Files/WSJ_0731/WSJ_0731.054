   WASHINGTON -- The House Armed Services Committee is
expected to propose ground rules today aimed at continuing
development but delaying production of several major weapons,
including the next generation of Air Force fighters and Army
helicopters.
   The committee, in a major departure from traditional
weapons-buying plans, is leaning strongly toward shelving
production of the so-called Advanced Tactical Fighter and LH
attack helicopter until prototype aircraft are thoroughly
tested, according to lawmakers and congressional staff
members. The programs carry a combined price tag of nearly
$85 billion, and they are inviting targets for deep cuts
because neither has begun production.

   Meanwhile, proponents of the B-2 Stealth bomber, built by
Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp., have given up the struggle
to try to buy two more of the embattled planes next year.
Instead of fighting for the nearly $2.5 billion of B-2
production funds requested by the Bush administration, House
supporters are now resigned to trying to retain a symbolic
$200 million in long-lead production money to avoid layoffs
and keep subcontractors in place.
   But Rep. Ike Skelton (D., Mo.), one of the radar-evading
plane's leading supporters, yesterday failed to convince a
subcommittee to authorize the $200 million during a
closed-door session. His amendment, Rep. Skelton said, "means
{the B-2} would, at least, stay alive." But it isn't clear
whether he and his supporters will push for a vote in the
committee, which is strongly opposed to buying more planes.
Supporters of the B-2, however, are betting that the Senate
will salvage the bomber.
   Blaming much of the B-2's political troubles on months of
lukewarm White House support, Rep. Skelton acknowledged that
the House is almost certain to eliminate all 1991 production
funds for the bomber. The Senate version of the bill,
however, contains nearly $2 billion for B-2 production. And
both measures include money to complete research and testing.
   Under the broad new procurement guidelines, spearheaded by
Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.), the Pentagon would have to
demonstrate the effectiveness of sophisticated avionics,
engines, computers and related equipment before committing to
even low-rate production of proposed aircraft. The goal is to
help the military and industry avoid making multibillion
dollar investments in tooling and other expensive overhead
before weapons have undergone rigorous testing. The B-2 isn't
expected to be affected by the proposal, lawmakers and
committee aides said.
   A number of former high-ranking Pentagon acquisition
officials have testified that such changes are necessary in
light of shrinking military budgets, and Rep. Aspin and his
aides have mulled over the idea since at least January. But
as late as yesterday, lawmakers were working out some of the
details.
   Many industry and Pentagon officials, however, are opposed
to the concept of developing weapons but then stopping short
of full-scale production, while research begins on a
more-advanced version of the same weapon. Air Force Secretary
Donald Rice, for instance, has said that putting
technological advances on the shelf rather than in the field
will provide arms makers in the Soviet Union and other
nations an opportunity to catch up to the U.S.
   Some lawmakers and committee aides said the new ground
rules, if they are part of the final defense spending bill
for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, also will slow down
procurement of the Navy's fast, super-quiet Seawolf attack
submarines.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month
voted to withhold production or full-scale development
funding for the Seawolf, LH helicopters, the Air Force's ATF
and the Navy's proposed A-12 carrier-based attack plane. But
the House panel, according to lawmakers and aides, is
expected to propose specific criteria for production
decisions.
   Rep. William Dickinson (R., Ala.), the committee's ranking
GOP member and a major supporter of Army aviation, said in an
interview last week that he was ready to accept significant
delays and cutbacks in the LH's planned production schedule.
"I wouldn't fall on my sword" over cuts, he said, adding, "I
think we've got a fight on our hands" simply to keep the
program alive.
