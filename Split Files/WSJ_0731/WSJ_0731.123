   Separately, Alpine reported earnings of $3.8 million, or
74 cents a share, for the fiscal year ended April 30,
compared with a loss of $11.7 million a year earlier. The
profit was attributable to a $20 million extraordinary gain
from "extinguishment of debt," the company said. The company
posted losses of $4.3 million on continuing operations and
$11.8 million on discontinued operations. In fiscal 1989,
those losses were $5.4 million and $6.3 million respectively.
Sales from continuing operations were $7.9 million, compared
with $6.3 million the previous year.
