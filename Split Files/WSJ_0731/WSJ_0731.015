   NEW YORK -- New construction contracts eased 2% in June
from May, reflecting stability in the second quarter,
following a volatile first quarter.
   F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said
nonresidential building contracts rose 5% in June, to $86.02
billion, from a seasonally adjusted $82.06 billion in May.
Non-building construction, including public works and
utilities, dropped 14%, to $44.8 billion, from $52.3 billion.
The non-building construction drop was essentially a retreat
to its former level after a spate of projects temporarily
elevated May's total. The value of newly started one-family
homes slipped 1%, to $109.94 billion, from $111.34 billion in
May.

   George A. Christie, chief economist at F.W. Dodge, said
the steepest part of the decline in construction activity
this year, amounting almost to a "free fall," was confined to
the first quarter. A smaller second-quarter decline and more
recent firming of monthly contracting data suggest a more
stable building market, Mr. Christie said.
   In the first six months, new construction totaled $121.3
billion, which was 8% below the year-ago level and the first
interruption of continuous expansion in construction activity
in seven years.
   At midyear, the Northeast region posted the deepest
decline in building, 24%, followed by the South, down 11%.
The only gain was in the North Central region, still ahead of
1989 by 5%. The West was virtually even with its year-ago
level of contracting.
