   The Journal certainly jumped on the soccer-bashing
bandwagon in David Brooks's "World Cup: Hooligans and Mad
Cows" (Leisure &amp; Arts, June 19).
   No, I'm not an English hooligan or a West German partial
to funny hats. Born in the U.S., I began playing soccer at
age 12 and haven't stopped. I still play on an over-30 team.

   I think the Journal, and the American media in general,
misses an important point when it comes to soccer. Just as
golf has evolved as a prized means of doing business in
corporate America, a knowledge and understanding of and
affinity for soccer among American business people could be
critical to our economic well-being in the emerging global
economy.
   If that sounds like balderdash, consider some of the
asinine reasons the media give for soccer's flagging success
in America: low-scoring, no hand-eye coordination required,
hooligans, mad cows. Enough already.
   The whole world plays the game. America is part of the
world, even though some closet jingoists continue to deny the
fact.
   It's time to get off our myopic high horse. We may not
know much about soccer, but then again, ask some Italian,
German or Cameroonian who won last year's Super Bowl.
