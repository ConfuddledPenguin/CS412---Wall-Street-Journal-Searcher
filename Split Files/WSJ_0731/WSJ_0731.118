   Oshkosh Truck Corp. said it had a loss of $2.5 million, or
28 cents a share, in its third quarter ended June 30, after
writing off $27 million, or 33%, of its total inventory.
Sales rose 1.5% to $128.2 million.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Oshkosh earned $4.5 million,
or 50 cents a share, on sales of $126.3 million.

   The Oshkosh, Wis., truck maker said much of the inventory,
which was either sold or written off at a cost of $4 million,
was either excess or obsolete and included both finished and
non-finished goods.
   Oshkosh said the write-off was necessary to "reduce
inventory carrying costs, gain manufacturing space, and
improve efficiency." The move also lowered the company's
short-term debt to $4.1 million on June 30 from $23.5 million
on March 31.
   The company said its outlook is "significantly brightened"
by the fact that the Department of Defense has selected
Oshkosh as the producer of the U.S. Army's new generation of
heavy-duty trucks.
   Oshkosh Class B stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close
at $10.625 a share in national over-the-counter trading.
