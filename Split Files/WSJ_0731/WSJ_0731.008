   WASHINGTON -- The vast consumer sector of the economy
mustered some energy in June after languishing for the
previous few months, the latest Commerce Department figures
indicate.
   Americans' personal spending rose a strong 1% in June
after remaining flat in May and edging up 0.2% in April, the
department reported. After adjusting for inflation, consumer
spending grew 0.5% after declining 0.3% in May and inching up
0.1% in April.

   The hearty June gain, the biggest since January, was
welcome news. Just last Friday, the Commerce Department had
reported that in the second quarter, consumer spending --
which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity -- actually declined, along with business
investment, construction and exports.
   "Consumer spending is sluggish, but what these numbers
confirm is it's not sluggish to the extent of being
recessionary," said Anthony Vignola, an economist and
managing director at Kidder Peabody in New York, after the
new spending figures were released. "The second quarter ended
on a much stronger note than it began."
   But Americans' personal income continued to grow only
modestly, the report said, edging up 0.4% in June after
rising 0.3% in both May and April. Wages and salaries, the
bulk of most people's income, grew 0.5% following a 0.4%
increase in May.
   Slow growth in job markets throughout much of the nation
suggests that gains in income could continue to be mild for a
while. And that means spending isn't likely to gather much
more vigor.
   Last month, however, a key sector of consumer spending --
purchases of big-ticket items known as durable goods -- grew
for the first time since January. Analysts attributed much of
the improvement to a jump in car sales in late June, but few
expect substantial increases in auto purchases in the near
future.
   Purchases of nondurable goods -- items including food and
clothes, whose sales are less likely to be affected by
economic trends -- also increased.
   With spending outstripping income growth last month,
Americans' savings rate fell to 4.9% of disposable income
from 5.4% in May.
   Low savings has been a nagging problem for the nation for
years, leading to a scarcity of funds to finance private
business investment and the federal budget deficit. That has
forced the government and industry to seek capital overseas.
   Overall, personal income equaled a $4.64 trillion annual
rate in June, while spending came to a $3.64 trillion annual
rate.
   All the numbers were adjusted for regular seasonal
fluctuations.
