   White wine with fish,
   Red with meat.
   With the main course, dry;
   With dessert, it's sweet.
   But there's one wine for sure
   That's bound to no norm,
   Since, as everyone knows,
   It's any port in a storm.

   Not only do parents start out with another mouth to feed,
they end up with another mouth they have to listen to.
