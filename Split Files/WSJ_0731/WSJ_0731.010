   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank said it will
guarantee a $37.5 million loan by Citibank N.A., New York, to
the Turkish government for the purchase of five Blackhawk
helicopters from the Sikorsky Aircraft division of United
Technologies Corp.
   The helicopters, which will be used by Turkey's national
police for law enforcement, medical emergencies and rescue
operations, will cost $44.4 million, including spare parts
and related ground-support equipment.
