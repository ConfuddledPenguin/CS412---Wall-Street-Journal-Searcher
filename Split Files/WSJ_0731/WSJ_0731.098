   LTV Corp., Dallas, said second-quarter net income more
than doubled because of a special gain this year and a
special charge a year earlier.
   Net rose to $76.6 million, or 59 cents a share, from $30.3
million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. The 1990
quarter reflected a gain of $44.3 million on the sale of a
stainless steel unit. The 1989 quarter was reduced by $80
million in write-downs and charges on aircraft production
assets.

   Operating profit fell 64% to $36.6 million from $102.6
million before charges a year earlier. Revenue fell 4.5% to
$1.59 billion from $1.66 billion.
   Steel operations contributed almost all of the decline in
operating profit. LTV, which is operating under protection of
bankruptcy law, attributed the decline to lower prices, lower
sales and higher labor costs.
   In the first half, profit rose to $120.8 million, or 91
cents a share, from $106.9 million, or 82 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue fell 6% to $3.08 billion from $3.28
billion.
