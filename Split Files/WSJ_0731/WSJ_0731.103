   Bayerische Vereinsbank AG of West Germany, citing higher
mortgage lending and a general rise in overall loan business,
said its partial group operating profit for the first half
increased 3.7%.
   The big mortgage and commercial banking concern said
partial operating profit, which excludes income from the
bank's trading in its own account, rose to 421 million marks
($261.2 million) from 406 million marks a year earlier.

   First-half full operating profit exceeded that of a year
earlier, the bank said, but didn't give details.
   At the parent bank, partial operating profit rose 11% to
284 million marks from 256 million marks. The bank's full
operating profit rose sharply, the bank said, citing higher
profit from trading in its own account in stocks, bonds and
foreign exchange.
