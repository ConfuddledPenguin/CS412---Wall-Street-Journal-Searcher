   MARKHAM, Ontario -- Magna International Inc. said it
agreed to sell its automotive electric-motors division to a
unit of Siemens AG of West Germany. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Magna, an auto-parts maker, said earlier this month that
it was in the final stages of negotiating the sale of the
division, which has annual sales of about 120 million
Canadian dollars ($104 million), to the Siemens unit.
