   Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., the controversial penny-stock
brokerage firm, said it filed for protection under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   The subject of repeated securities investigations since
1979, Blinder Robinson said it will move its accounts to
another brokerage firm, which it didn't identify. It said it
had stopped selling securities before seeking bankruptcy-law
protection.

   Profits have been sliding for some time as investors
abandoned the penny stock market and Blinder Robinson, which
is considered the largest broker-dealer of the risky
low-priced stocks. Underwriting dried up. "Everyone is
against the penny stock market," founder Meyer Blinder
complained last year.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission was chief among
Blinder's foes. Earlier this month, the agency sued the
Englewood, Colo., firm in a Philadelphia federal court
seeking to recover $20 million in profits allegedly gained by
"charging excessive and undisclosed markups" on securities
sales.
   In April, an SEC hearing officer suspended Blinder
Robinson from soliciting sales of securities for 45 days and
barred it from underwriting for two years. The officer barred
Mr. Blinder as well, citing "a high probability that Mr.
Blinder cannot ever operate in the securities industry in
compliance with the law." The company has appealed.
   In February, a federal grand jury in Las Vegas, Nev.,
indicted Blinder Robinson and four associates on 11 counts of
securities and wire fraud, racketeering and money laundering.
   All of its legal problems notwithstanding, Blinder
Robinson was brought down by its faltering operations. In
recent years, Denver-based Stuart-James Co., founded by two
former Blinder Robinson executives and itself the subject of
securities investigations, is believed to have eclipsed
Blinder Robinson as the largest dealer in penny stocks. Last
year, investors changed the name of Blinder Robinson's
parent, Blinder International Enterprises Inc., to
Intercontinental Enterprises Inc.
   "The decline of business at Blinder Robinson is the major
reason for this filing," said Frank Birgfeld, Denver district
director of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
   Mr. Birgfeld doubted the Securities Investor Protection
Corp., which insures brokerage accounts to $100,000, will
allow Blinder Robinson to assign its accounts. Under the law,
Securities Investor Protection Corp. can take control of
Blinder Robinson and handle the disposition itself.
   Blinder Robinson officials couldn't be reached for
comment.
