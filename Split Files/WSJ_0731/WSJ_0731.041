   WASHINGTON -- "Put the S&amp;L crooks in jail]" has become the
election-year battle cry on Capitol Hill.
   But despite the ubiquitous slogan -- on banners draped at
hearings and on buttons pinned to blazer lapels -- lawmakers
are pushing criminal statutes that won't have much effect on
anyone associated with the savings-and-loan debacle of the
1980s.

   Life prison terms for "S&amp;L kingpins," stiff new mandatory
minimum sentences for other "S&amp;L violators," new criminal
statutes for obstructing government regulators -- these are
just a few elements of what's being presented as a punitive
panacea on Capitol Hill.
   "Whether bank robbers steal their loot with a pistol or
with a pencil, they should serve hard time," declares Senate
Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.).
   What Sen. Biden and other lawmakers fail to stress in
their get-tough admonitions is that the proposed new criminal
offenses and penalties wouldn't apply retroactively. That
means that any criminal acts committed before President Bush
signs new S&amp;L enforcement provisions -- which he would do at
the earliest this fall -- wouldn't be covered by the new
laws.
   "It is misleading to justify new criminal penalties on the
notion that they will be used to punish the people who
allegedly caused these losses," says John Villa, a Washington
lawyer. "New criminal statutes and increased penalties do not
apply retroactively to past conduct" under the constitutional
prohibition of "ex post facto" laws.
   Lawmakers are creating "a smokescreen to shift the
culpability for the S&amp;L mess from the Congress and onto a few
unscrupulous businessmen," says Sen. William Armstrong (R.,
Colo.), the lone dissenter in the Senate's 99-1 vote on the
thrift enforcement measures. "The fact is the S&amp;L mess . . .
was not primarily the result of wrongdoing of a few thrift
executives, but of a collapse of a thrift system established
by and overseen by the Congress."
   Robert Davis, a senior Justice Department official in the
Reagan administration who now practices privately in Dallas,
says Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also deserves blame for
orchestrating news conferences announcing S&amp;L indictments --
an effort to counter Democratic charges of lax S&amp;L
prosecution. "He's distorting things; criminality had to do
with only 5% of the losses," says the lawyer, citing an
estimate used by some private consultants. Mr. Thornburgh
puts the figure at 30%, while civil regulators say it's 50%
or 60%.
   In contrast to the criminal counterparts,
civil-enforcement measures moving through Congress could have
a Draconian impact. Such provisions as those expanding
prosecutors' ability to freeze and forfeit personal assets of
officers and directors of failed thrifts "could destroy
someone who made bad {but not criminal} business decisions,"
says David Baris, executive director of a Washington trade
association that represents bank and thrift directors.
   To be sure, proposed funding authorizations for the hiring
of hundreds of federal agents and prosecutors would enable
the Justice Department to chip away at mountainous backlogs
of financial fraud cases. And certainly, were there ever a
repeat of the S&amp;L blow-out, lawmakers would be lambasted if
they hadn't increased criminal penalties.
   But given the likely future state of the thrift industry
-- greatly consolidated and more rigorously regulated -- the
bulk of the proposed criminal legislation appears to be more
backward-looking rhetoric than substantive cure or deterrent.
   Some provisions approved by the House Judiciary Committee
-- such as a ban on obstructing regulators -- create
redundant criminal statutes for acts already prosecutable
under existing fraud law.
   Other measures are entirely bureaucratic in nature. Both
the House and Senate legislation would establish a Financial
Institutions Fraud Unit within the Justice Department to
coordinate S&amp;L fraud prosecutions. The department created
such a unit on its own months ago.
   Prosecutors are happy about proposals to strengthen
procedural weapons in financial fraud cases, such as the push
to expand the applicability of the federal anti-racketeering
law to bank and thrift fraud.
   But some of the new legal weapons aren't well suited to
these crimes. At the Justice Department's behest, lawmakers
in the House and Senate have proposed to expand wire-tap
authority to investigate thrift crime. But prosecutors and
agents privately admit that such surveillance is rarely, if
ever, possible in cases that typically involve recreating
intricate paper trails long after suspicious transactions
have occurred.
   The Justice Department vehemently opposes a House proposal
to create a bi-partisan national commission to investigate
the causes of the S&amp;L crisis and propose solutions. "Such a
commission would not . . . make any meaningful contribution,"
but would result in considerable second-guessing of
enforcement efforts, charges James Richmond, the department's
recently named special counsel for financial fraud.
   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), prime sponsor of the
House legislation, defends the commission as a cornerstone of
restoring the thrift industry and preventing future crises.
The panel, he says, will enable all involved "to move forward
to solve rather than snipe."
