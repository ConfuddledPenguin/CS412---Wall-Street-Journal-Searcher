   WASHINGTON -- After a decade of efforts to improve schools
with more money, better teachers and stiffer requirements,
educators are focusing on a more basic key to success: the
involvement of parents in their children's education.
   "You can't bring about major reform unless parents are
going to be a part of it," says Christopher Cross, the
Education Department's assistant secretary for research. "You
have got to have parents understand that they do make a
difference, and you've got to get the teachers and the
principals to understand the importance of parental
involvement."

   A nationwide federal survey of 24,600 eighth graders in
1,000 public and private schools shows that this message
isn't getting through. Nearly half the students said they
rarely discuss school with their parents. A survey of the
eighth graders' parents reveals that only about half of them
have any contact with their children's schools.
   The survey, called the National Educational Longitudinal
Survey of 1988, was conducted for the Education Department
two years ago, but the results are just beginning to
circulate. "One of the things that's clearly shown is the
disengagement of parents from the schools and from their
children's performance," Mr. Cross says.
   Parental interest in school is one of the building blocks
of success, educators say. When parents fail to stress the
importance of education, "then the kids tend to do pretty
much as they want, which is to say, not much at all," says
Tommy Tomlinson, a senior researcher at the Education
Department.
   Students who aspire to the most competitive colleges must
work hard, but most colleges aren't selective. "Any kid who
gets out of high school can get into college" somewhere, Mr.
Tomlinson says. And few employers hire students on the basis
of their high school records or even look at grade
transcripts.
   "On average, U.S. students, by most measures and at every
level of class and ability, appear to be less serious about
school and less willing to commit their time and energy to
learning than the nation's aspirations require," Mr.
Tomlinson says.
   The survey of eighth graders bears this out. The students
reported that they spend an average of 21.4 hours a week
watching television but only 5.6 hours doing homework and 1.8
hours on outside reading. Nearly 63% of the students report
that their parents rarely or never limit the amount of TV
they watch.
   "The reform movement has looked at everything but how to
make students work harder," says Nelson Smith, the director
of the Education Department's programs for the improvement of
practice.
   Parental involvement in education has been a victim of
changes in American family life, says Samuel Sava, executive
director of the National Association of Elementary School
Principals. Since 1965, the divorce rate, the ratio of
children living in single-parent families and the proportion
of married mothers of young children working outside the home
have all doubled. As a result, he says, parents have less
time and energy to devote to their children's education.
   "This family revolution is the greatest single cause of
the decline in student achievement during the last 20 years,"
Mr. Sava says. "It's not better teachers, texts or curricula
that our children need most; it's better childhoods, and we
will never see lasting school reform until we first see
parent reform."
   Many schools do encourage parental involvement at the
primary level, but beyond the early grades schools tend to do
less to induce parental partnership in education. Joyce
Epstein, of the Center for Research on Elementary and Middle
Schools at Johns Hopkins University, says that "middle grade
parents receive less information or guidance at the very time
they need more information and more guidance in how to be
involved in larger and more complex schools and in new and
more complex class schedules and subjects."
   And James Coleman, a professor of sociology at the
University of Chicago, maintains that many schools have
actually made "strong attempts to keep parents from
interfering with what's going on in school."
   But that's beginning to change. As part of a sweeping
school system reorganization, the state of Kentucky plans to
install telephones in every classroom to make it easier for
teachers and parents to reach each other during the day. In
Bloomfield, Conn., the schools ask parents to read to young
children and send home suggested texts. Dade County, Fla.,
and St. Paul, Minn., are building elementary schools close to
factories and office buildings, making it easier for parents
to meet with teachers and attend school events.
   In some places, school systems have been reorganized to
encourage more parental involvement. In Chicago, local school
boards have been placed under parental control, and New York
City is beginning to seek greater parental involvement in
running some schools. Eight states, led by Minnesota, have
adopted plans that allow parents to register their children
in any school in the state. The spread of such "choice" plans
will lead to wider parent involvement in monitoring their
children's performances, Mr. Coleman says.
   The survey of eighth graders illustrates the problems that
can arise when parents don't pay enough attention to their
children's schooling. Two-thirds of the students said they
hoped to graduate from college, yet less than 30% planned to
take a college preparatory program in high school. One reason
for this mismatch may be that only about half of the students
talked to their parents more than three times about planning
their high school program, and less than half of the students
talked to their teachers about high school courses.

   In the spring of 1988, 24,600 eighth grade students were
asked how often that school year they had talked with one or
both of their parents or guardians about:

   Once or twice                    46.5%
   Three or more times              38.9%
   Not at all                       14.6%
