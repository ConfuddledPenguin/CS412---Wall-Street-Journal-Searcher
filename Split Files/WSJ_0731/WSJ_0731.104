   Dresdner Bank AG said its group partial operating profit
rose 8.9% in the first half to 956.1 million marks ($593.1
million) from 878.1 million marks a year earlier.
   West Germany's second-largest banking group said its
parent bank alone posted a 24% rise in partial operating
profit in the first half to 603.8 million marks from 487.7
million marks a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Dresdner, like most West German companies, reports its
financial results on a world-wide, or group, basis as well as
on a domestic, or parent company, level that excludes foreign
and some domestic subsidiaries.
   Partial operating data are before taxes and exclude gains
or losses from the company's trading operations for its own
account.
   Frankfurt-based Dresdner didn't report group full
operating profit, which includes the trading results, for the
first half. But the company characterized the full operating
profit for the group in the first half as "developing clearly
more favorably" than the partial figures.
   For the parent bank, full operating profit attained
"double-digit" growth, Dresdner said, without providing data.
