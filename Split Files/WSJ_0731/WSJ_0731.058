   SAN FRANCISCO -- Chevron Corp. said it completed the sale
of its Freeport, Bahamas, storage and marine facilities to
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., the state-owned oil company of
Venezuela.
   Chevron said it will receive about $120 million in cash,
plus a long-term contractual right to storage services in
Freeport. The company previously hadn't indicated the
payment. The sale includes storage and marine facilities, and
a refinery that has been inoperative since 1985.
