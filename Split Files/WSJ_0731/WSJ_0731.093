   Electronic Data Systems Corp., a unit of General Motors
Corp., said it won a $700 million, eight-year contract to
provide the Army, Navy and Defense Logistics Agency with
general purpose computers.
   The contract calls for EDS to provide up to 20,000
computers and systems for general office uses by the agencies
by 1995. EDS also will be responsible for engineering,
installation, training and maintenance of the systems.

   Total spending authorization for the project is $1.3
billion, but government officials said they estimate total
spending for the project will be around $700 million.
   The contract comes as new business to EDS, GM's
Dallas-based computer systems services unit. SMS Data Systems
Corp. of McClean, Va., had provided those agencies with
similar services under a former contract.
