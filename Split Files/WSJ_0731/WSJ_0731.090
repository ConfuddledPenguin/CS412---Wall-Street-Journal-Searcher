   US Sprint's long-distance telephone service, the company
advertises, uses a fiber-optic network so pure "you can hear
a pin drop."
   That phrase also might describe the stunned silence,
within the telecommunications industry and on Wall Street,
after the latest news from Sprint: It lost $42 million in the
second quarter.

   The July 17 jolt, which included a $72 million
restructuring charge, knocked a third off the stock-market
value of Sprint's parent, United Telecommunications Inc.,
whose own profit fell 55%. The loss also drew angry charges
of mismanagement and deceit from analysts and shareholders,
several of whom are suing.
   But the wider impact could be on the country's $50 billion
annual long-distance phone bill, and on industry regulation.
US Sprint Communications Co. is one of the few challengers to
take a significant share of a market dominated by giant
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. With Sprint reeling, "the
fundamental question is whether there is competition out
there," says David Wagenhauser, head of the
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a consumer
watchdog group.
   For AT&amp;T, which is pleading with the Federal
Communications Commission to ease regulation and end the
company's official designation as the nation's "dominant"
carrier, the Sprint troubles are most inopportune. They come
as the long-distance market is rapidly consolidating into an
oligopoly headed by AT&amp;T and second-ranked MCI, which has
agreed to buy the fourth largest carrier, Telecom USA. There
are many tiny players, but they have been vanishing; the
number of carriers and "resellers" of long-distance service
has plunged from 500 in 1986 to about 275 today, according to
the Competitive Telecommunications Association (Comptel).
   As a result, consumer watchdogs say, customers can expect
higher rates. AT&amp;T, after having seen industry pricing fall
steadily by almost 45% since its 1984 breakup, recently
announced its first price increase to individuals and
businesses since the breakup. Rivals are expected to follow
suit. And with the decline of competition, the watchdogs say,
comes less incentive to introduce innovative services. "We
fear a repeat of what happened in the airline industry," says
Catherine Sloan, Comptel's legislative director. "Two or
three top carriers dominated by a price leader can
automatically drive prices up."
   AT&amp;T's almost 70% of the market towers over MCI
Communications Corp.'s 14% and Sprint's 10%, enabling AT&amp;T to
set industry price and service standards. Yet the FCC closed
off a window on AT&amp;T's cost structure, which was an aid to
competitors, by moving last year to regulate AT&amp;T with simple
price caps instead of a cost-based formula. Moreover, the FCC
is considering dropping AT&amp;T's "dominant" designation, saying
industry competition is sufficient to warrant the change.
That would mean AT&amp;T would face far less scrutiny by
regulators than it does now.
   As for AT&amp;T, "Our contention is that this is an
extraordinarily competitive market," says Victor A. Pelson,
group executive of communications services.
   The Sprint debacle provides a rallying point for the
opposition to a freer hand for AT&amp;T. The FCC's "price caps
{have} failed to protect consumers adequately," says the
Consumer Federation of America. Comptel's Ms. Sloan, whose
group represents small industry players, asks, "If Sprint's
having trouble, how can smaller companies think about
succeeding?"
   Sprint's chairman, William T. Esrey, says such concerns
are simply part of a "gross overreaction" to a down quarter.
"This is not some fundamental problem that's across the
board. It's a setback, and we took corrective action."
   Still, in a memo to employees after the earnings report,
Mr. Esrey said that while United Telecommunications' local
phone services remained strong, "US Sprint is struggling.
Revenues are under expectations {and} expenses continue to be
too high. We must do two things: increase revenues and bring
costs in line -- and we must do them immediately." Last week
the company began eliminating many jobs.
   Financial analysts fear that Sprint is ill-positioned for
a long-distance marketing battle that is increasingly
expensive. "This is a marketing business," says Frank
Governali, an analyst at First Boston Corp. "You have to
spend more to get more." Sprint's problem is that it must
simultaneously cut its soaring costs and increase its sales
efforts.
   Jack B. Grubman, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber
Inc., adds: "MCI is buying market share, and AT&amp;T is going to
make things very tough for its competitors." He predicts that
"a year from now the headlines are going to read, `AT&amp;T is
gaining market share.'"
   AT&amp;T has already sewn up numerous national accounts with
multiyear discount pricing and services plans, called Tariff
12 contracts, for big corporations. And the telephone giant
is forestalling defections in the consumer and small-business
market with a new ad campaign that tells customers to "get it
in writing." Further helping it compete, AT&amp;T has transferred
thousands of employees out of staff jobs and into sales work.
   MCI, meanwhile, is aggressively courting the low end of
the market with increased advertising and blitz
telemarketing. It has hired Pioneer Teletechnologies Inc. of
Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, where hundreds of employees drum up
business for MCI at all hours.
   MCI is also fighting to weaken Sprint's hold on 40% of the
multibillion-dollar federal long-distance phone contract,
called FTS-2000 (AT&amp;T has the other 60%). If MCI should win
the right to sell advanced voice and data services to federal
agencies, Sprint and AT&amp;T could find themselves with a far
less lucrative contract; most of what they've been able to
sell so far is plain old phone service.
   Yet Sprint's problems transcend competition and reflect
major management problems, say some analysts, customers and
former Sprint executives.
   They say senior executives missed a shift in the
long-distance market from a price war to a marketing battle
that stresses service. Not only are Sprint's costs out of
control because of overstaffing, but its billing problems --
the source of much woe in years past -- have returned with a
vengeance. These problems have annoyed customers and strained
relations with Sprint's own sales people, some of whom aren't
being paid on time.
   "The last-minute surprise of the quarter's financial
results means they don't have control over their business,"
contends Robert B. Morris III, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co.
   Not so, insists Mr. Esrey. "There's a great sense of
urgency and seriousness here, but in no way a lack of
optimism," he says. "There are a couple of areas where we
haven't done what we should and we are taking corrective
action."
   Mr. Esrey says US Sprint, a company with $4 billion in
annual revenue, will bounce back by cutting about 1,000 staff
jobs, using fewer outside contractors and adding sales
people. The company also has a "lot of development effort
going on to bring out some new products," he says.
   Others say Sprint faces some tall obstacles. One is a
credibility problem with investors. At least six shareholder
suits have been filed in Kansas City federal courts alleging
that Mr. Esrey and the parent company misled investors about
Sprint's prospects.
   Mr. Esrey says Sprint is "doing sensationally" in signing
up large corporate customers. But industry watchers say the
company hasn't won a big bid for some time. When pressed to
give numbers on his national account business, Mr. Esrey
declines.
   Analysts and former executives also say Sprint is falling
behind on the amount of revenue it had planned to receive
from the FTS-2000 federal contract by this time. They
estimate Sprint had expected $50 million to $75 million in
revenue per quarter by this time but got only $30 million in
the second quarter.
   "Whoever told you that doesn't know what they're talking
about," says Mr. Esrey, declining to give numbers. "FTS is 18
months ahead of schedule. Sales are going very well." The
problem, he says, has been simply a matter of resources. "We
have been outmanned -- outpersoned -- and outgunned, by AT&amp;T
in particular," says the executive, who is lobbying hard
against any FCC move to unshackle the industry leader.
   Some current and former executives say a broad management
shift last fall preoccupied and distracted US Sprint. Mr.
Esrey chose people from parent United Telecommunications for
nearly all his senior management positions, including that of
Sprint president (Ronald LeMay). Critics suggest that the
United executives, used to running their highly successful
monopoly local phone business, were ill-prepared to compete
with the likes of MCI in long distance. Although MCI and AT&amp;T
telegraphed their competitive punches, holding the line on
pricing while aggressively shifting their sales pitches to
emphasize service, Sprint continued running its aging
hear-a-pin-drop ads. It still does.
   "I sit up nights and think about those" ads, says Mr.
Esrey. Noting that Sprint's brash move into fiber-optics
pushed its rivals to rush out their own fiber systems, he
adds, "We were there first but didn't do an effective job of
getting this message across."
   People knowledgeable about Sprint's operations say the
company's managers also failed to attend to some details,
particularly the billing situation. A phone company's most
crucial operation beyond its switching centers is its
computerized billing system. This must take data on millions
of calls a day from the network's switching centers, price
each call, and turn all this into bills at the end of each
month.
   "Billing is just ungodly" at Sprint, says Tom Colvin,
telecommunications manager at Marshall Industries, an El
Monte, Calif., electronics parts distributor. Mr. Colvin, who
estimates his monthly Sprint bill at $170,000, says he only
recently received his long-distance phone bill for March,
April and May. "If things don't improve we're going to drop
them," he says.
   Says Mr. Esrey: "Occasionally we had hiccups, and
sometimes we were days late."
   Several top executives have left Sprint in the past few
weeks, including the man who supervised the billing system
and much of his staff, but also the manager who led Sprint's
successful effort to win part of the federal phone project.
United Telecommunications says their exits were unrelated to
current problems.
   More changes are in store, and they won't be limited to
"the worker bee level," says Mr. Esrey. "Nothing is sacred as
far as how we can be structured better."
