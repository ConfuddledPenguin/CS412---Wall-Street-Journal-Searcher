   PARIS -- After General Electric Co. took over the troubled
French medical-equipment maker Cie. Generale de Radiologie in
1988, the U.S. company decided to boost the morale of its new
French employees.
   GE called a training seminar for French and other European
managers. In their hotel rooms, the company left colorful
T-shirts emblazoned with the GE slogan "Go for One." A note
urged the managers to wear the T-shirts "to show that you are
members of the team."

   The French wore them, grudgingly, to the seminar, but, as
one of the French managers recalls: "It was like Hitler was
back, forcing us to wear uniforms. It was humiliating."
   GE insists it wasn't trying to force anyone to wear the
shirts. "It's just one of those things that Americans
sometimes do at meetings," says a spokeswoman.
   That gaffe was the opening round in a bitter and prolonged
cultural clash at GE-CGR. The French company, formerly a
sedate state-owned concern that had been run much like a
government ministry, found itself in the hands of brash,
all-American, profit-hungry GE.
   After two years of restructuring, massive layoffs and a
continuing flight of French managers and engineers -- the
work force has shrunk to about 5,000 from 6,500 -- GE-CGR is
still posting losses. It has shuttered about half of its
dozen plants in Europe, and more closings are planned. Worse,
instead of its projected $25 million profit last year, GE-CGR
had a $25 million loss and expects to lose nearly as much
this year, say individuals close to the company. The chief
executive officer GE brought in two years ago has just been
replaced by Steve Riedel, from its medical-equipment
headquarters in Milwaukee; his job is to halt the hemorrhage.
   GE's troubles show that even a big, mature company
renowned for its management skills can stumble when entering
a starkly different business environment. Some analysts
wonder if GE can avoid the management faux pas it made at
GE-CGR at its other new European subsidiaries, such as the
recently acquired Hungarian light-bulb maker Tungsram.
   "Integrating cultures is one of the major challenges of
business today; it's an acute problem," says Martin
Waldenstrom, president of Booz-Allen Acquisition Services in
Paris. "It's humiliating enough for a company to be acquired.
If you add to that a very different style of management,
chances are that both sides are going to have problems."
   At CGR, employees accustomed to government subsidies and
guaranteed purchases by state-owned hospitals have been
shocked by GE's corporate style. A maker of X-ray machines,
CAT scanners and other large diagnostic machines for
hospitals, CGR had little competitive-market experience
either at home or abroad. And GE has had trouble teaching it.
   For example, soon after the takeover, GE set out to fix
CGR's financial-control system. U.S. computer specialists are
said to have imposed a GE system that was unsuited to French
financial-reporting requirements or to the way CGR kept
records, and the company spent months seeking a workable
compromise. Paulo Fresco, GE's senior vice president for
international operations, says such events taught a lesson
for managing a foreign acquisition: "Don't scrap the old
system before the new one is running."
   GE managers made the painful restructuring even worse by
plastering English-language posters everywhere, flying GE
flags and otherwise making GE's culture ubiquitous. "They
came in here bragging, `We are GE, we're the best and we've
got the methods,'" says a CGR union leader. "The more they
said, the worse it got."
   GE's culture is an extension of the strong personality of
its combative chairman, John F. Welch Jr. He preaches a
philosophy of self-reliance, hard work and big profits -- a
sort of evangelical capitalism. At company meetings in Paris,
gung-ho American staffers would chant his credo -- "speed,
simplicity and self-confidence" -- to skeptical French
managers.
   GE's goal in acquiring CGR was to make France the center
of its European medical-equipment business, and it insists
those plans haven't changed.
   "I think there is trauma in every acquisition," says
Vincenzo Morelli, the 35-year-old GE whiz kid who was sent to
run CGR after the takeover and who has just been transferred
to London. "Company cultures are always different."
   An Italian who became a solid convert to GE's philosophy,
Mr. Morelli calls the purchase "a brilliant strategic move."
GE took control in a complicated swap with state-controlled
electronics giant Thomson S.A. It got CGR and $800 million in
cash from Thomson in return for its RCA consumer-electronics
division.
   Mr. Morelli says the purchase already has given GE a
strong European presence. The company won't give figures for
Europe, but says its world-wide medical business is
profitable. Orders for the first half at GE-CGR were up 18%
over last year's period, GE says, and sales rose 10%. It
expects CGR to turn a profit in 1991.
   But Mr. Morelli and other GE executives acknowledge that
the company did underestimate the cultural problems it would
encounter. "We've tried to avoid the impression of imposing a
victorious culture on a vanquished culture," says Mr. Fresco.
"But nobody has discovered the perfect formula for cultural
integration."
   French employees say they knew CGR was uncompetitive even
before GE appeared. They expected layoffs and restructuring,
but say they haven't yet seen the organization and leadership
they expected from GE.
   "The impression you get is that they are going to make a
(serious) effort for a year or two, and if it doesn't work GE
will just pull out of most manufacturing here," says Michel
Houeix, who heads GE-CGR's biggest union. GE insists it is
committed to making the CGR operation a success.
   In the short term, GE faces possible further defections by
key white-collar staffers, some of whom fear it is slowly
closing CGR as a center of product development and
production. The original plan, which many French employees
accepted, was to make CGR part of the broader GE
medical-equipment network. CGR would stop producing some of
its most advanced items, such as scanners and
magnetic-resonance imagers, but would become a world leader
for sophisticated ultrasound machines and devices for
detecting breast cancer.
   But GE says it found some CGR products were uncompetitive
technologically and much more expensive than GE's competing
products being produced in Japan. So GE moved its ultrasound
production and development to Japan, entailing
production-line closures and layoffs.
   Thus, morale is low. Some of the best people are leaving,
union leaders say, and turmoil at CGR makes it hard to
recruit replacements. Today, only five of the 12 vice
presidents are French. Most key business functions --
finance, marketing and personnel -- are run by Americans.
