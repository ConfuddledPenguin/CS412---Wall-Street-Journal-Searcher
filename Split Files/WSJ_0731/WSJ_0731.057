   Girard Partners L.P., controlled by investor David H.
Batchelder, said it doesn't expect to be able to make an
all-cash offer to acquire Pic `N' Save Corp. at a price
attractive to shareholders.
   Girard said in La Jolla, Calif., that it drew this
conclusion after consulting with potential financing sources
and after examining information on Pic `N' Save. Pic `N'
Save, a Dominguez, Calif., chain of retail stores that
specialize in close-out merchandise, had no immediate
comment.

   Girard Partners and Pic `N' Save have been involved in a
dogfight ever since Girard announced in April that it planned
to make a bid for the company. On Sunday, the companies ended
a standstill agreement under which they agreed not to solicit
proxies or consents for control of the company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Girard said that it believes that financing may be available
for a recapitalization of Pic `N' Save if a majority of
Girard nominees are elected to the company's board. If the
Girard nominees are elected, and no other acquisition
proposals are received by the company's Aug. 29 annual
meeting, Girard said it will propose and seek to complete a
recapitalization of Pic `N' Save.
   Such a plan would involve the buy-back of a substantial
number of Pic `N' Save common shares, or an extraordinary
dividend, in either event using the proceeds of senior debt
financing, Girard said.
   Girard said it may also consider formulating an
acquisition proposal for Pic `N' Save, either alone or with
others, in which a portion of the consideration would be cash
and the balance would be either equity or equity and
subordinated debt securities.
   If the Girard nominees are elected and the company isn't
sold, Girard said it intends to conduct an evaluation of all
current executive officers of the company to determine what
management changes should be made. The Girard nominees intend
to seek to attract former managers to return to the company,
according to the filing. The Girard nominees would
significantly slow the company's new-store growth and focus
its efforts on existing-store development and profitability,
they said.
   Pic `N' Save shares closed yesterday at $10.625, off 75
cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
