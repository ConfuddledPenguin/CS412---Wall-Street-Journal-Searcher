   Milwaukee -- Had Baraboo, Wis., been better equipped with
bathrooms, Baraboo would be the dateline on this story. As it
happened, Baraboo, a town of 8,000 residents 120 miles
northwest of Milwaukee, had the world's greatest collection
of circus wagons, but Milwaukee had bathrooms and Ben Barkin,
and that's why The Great Circus Parade takes place in
Milwaukee each July.
   Mr. Barkin got involved back in 1963 when C.P. "Chappie"
Fox, who was director of Baraboo's Circus World Museum,
wanted to stage a parade to show off the museum's collection
of rare circus wagons. He met turndowns on all sides until he
got to Mr. Barkin, Schlitz's PR man, who had happy childhood
memories of watering circus animals on the Milwaukee
lakefront in exchange for free tickets. Mr. Barkin believed
there was a good market for the authentic nostalgic Americana
that circus parades represent, but he insisted that the
thousands of people who might come would need the facilities
of a city. In 1963, Schlitz put up $125,000 for Milwaukee's
first Great Circus Parade. Now years past official
retirement, Mr. Barkin has found a second career as full-time
volunteer coordinator of the parade. For the July 15
production he raised $1,403,000 (the budget called for
$1,375,000) from several large corporate donors, some
foundations, and thousands of individual circus fans.

   Mr. Barkin has his hand in every aspect: loading the
wagons onto the circus train at Baraboo, riding the train
through Madison and the Chicago suburbs, unloading the wagons
on the lakefront in Milwaukee, and locating, housing and
feeding the animals (762 horses, 21 camels, one pygmy hippo,
a giraffe, four boa constrictors and assorted other creatures
-- Mr. Barkin's budget allowed for 2,800 bales of hay and 50
mammoth tents).
   It rained on the parade this year, a cold intermittent
drizzle that cut the crowd a tad, but very little else went
wrong. The Baraboo High School band kept its white clown
suits spotless through blocks of mud and manure. The giraffe
behaved admirably (although he refused to enter his
high-canopied parade wagon without a bribe of Froot-Loops);
the pygmy hippo (who had spent the pre-parade days napping)
rose to the occasion and roared; the 40-horse hitch clomped
forward, backward and neatly around corners; the harem girls
(members of the Milwaukee Ballet) stayed atop their camels
with varying degrees of grace; the eight-camel hitch pulling
the Temple Tableau did not spit or split; the top hats and
tail ribbons on the elephants stayed put; the sunburst wheels
did not spin off the antique wagons; the 50-year-old steam
calliope did not explode; the arms of the stupendously
energetic carillonneur playing the Musical Bells of Moscow
(built in 1892 in Milwaukee for Ringling Bros.) did not give
out; and the bands played on and on.
   The threats of racial violence that bedeviled parade
planners had pretty much quieted down before parade time;
nevertheless there was a high profile of uniformed police.
(Let's hear a circus hurrah right here for No. 1939 {a black
man} and No. 1371 {a white man}, who handled the corner of
Third and Wisconsin with amazing teamwork and patience.)
   Circus parades developed in the early 19th century as a
means of transportation and an advertising ploy for traveling
shows. Wagons were added to the entourages around 1850, when
circuses started using tents. Circuses having always involved
heavy hype, the wagons immediately became moving posters,
touting (with liberal doses of artistic and advertising
license) the shows' attractions.
   Baraboo got more than its fair share of such equipment,
because the Ringlings wintered their show there from 1884 to
1918. Their Baraboo cousins, the Moellers, built circus
wagons. This circus heritage is commemorated in the town by
the State Historical Society of Wisconsin's Circus World
Museum. When the museum opened in 1959 there were three or
four wagons on display, but more importantly, there were
still people in Baraboo who understood and appreciated
circus-wagon construction and decoration. The 76 wagons that
rolled through Milwaukee's streets with their perfectly
restored, repainted and regilded wooden carvings were
selected from the museum's collection of more than 150.
   Circus wagons fall into three general categories: tableau,
band wagons and animal cages, all built to be heavily loaded
and pulled by horses over rutted roads and muddy circus
grounds. The tableau wagons evolved from decorated baggage
carts to elaborately engineered telescoping masterpieces
designed to transport only imaginations. They still do. The
heavily gilded red-and-green Twin Lions Telescoping Tableau,
built in England more than 100 years ago (four-layered and 17
feet, seven inches from the street to the tips of the lion's
ears), was one of the most fantastic things in the parade.
   Mr. Barkin's insistence on authenticity has made parade
day a magnet for horse fans. In addition to the hitches of
Belgians, Clydesdales and Percherons that pulled most of the
wagons, there were mules, Morgans, Lippizaners, miniature
horses, tiny donkeys and spectacularly costumed equestrienne
teams.
   (The horses account for one of the prime sideshows of the
affair. Sidewalk bookies take bets on where horse droppings
will land; for a quarter you chalk out and initial a circle
on the street. There apparently are unlimited -- and probably
unprintable -- refinements to this activity, but this year
the rain washed away the whole business.)
   In the days of circus street parades, most shows owned a
band wagon that served as a Pied Piper at the end of the
procession.
   The Great Circus Parade sported a dozen, including the
111-year-old superbly carved Lion and Mirror; the gloriously
painted, red, white and gold Great Britain Bandwagon (pulled
by a matched set of eight black Percherons with red
trappings); and the wonderful 40-horse hitch, the 10-ton Two
Hemispheres, the largest band wagon ever built. The Two
Hemispheres and the rollicking, steam-spewing calliope made a
truly grand Grand Finale.
   "It's the joy," Mr. Barkin declared as the last strains of
the calliope faded away. "It is the joy that this brings to
people; it lifts the spirit of the community -- that's the
one thing this means to me."
