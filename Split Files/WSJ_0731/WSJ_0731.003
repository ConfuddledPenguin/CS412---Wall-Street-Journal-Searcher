   TORONTO -- Varity Corp. announced an array of measures
intended to improve shareholder value, including a plan to
reincorporate in the U.S. and undertake a 1-for-10 share
consolidation.
   Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive officer of the
industrial holding company, told the annual meeting that he
will seek shareholder approval of Varity's plan to become a
Delaware corporation before the fiscal year ends on Jan. 31.

   "We are for all intents and purposes already a U.S.
company with a Canadian address," Mr. Rice said. More than
80% of Varity's shareholders are U.S. residents, the U.S.
will account for about 50% of corporate revenue in fiscal
1991, and the bulk of trading in Varity shares is conducted
at stock exchanges in the U.S., he said.
   Mr. Rice also said Varity's future acquisitions are likely
to be made in the U.S., as the company has US$450 million in
tax-loss carry-forwards at its disposal there.
   The proposed share consolidation, Mr. Rice said, would
benefit Varity holders by reducing the large number of common
shares outstanding, now totaling about 250 million.
   Rumors that Varity would re-incorporate in the U.S. have
drawn heated criticism from Canadian labor groups concerned
about job losses. The governments of Canada and the province
of Ontario also have said such a move might violate terms of
an accord under which they invested 200 million Canadian
dollars (US$173.6 million) in Varity to help it stave off a
bankruptcy-law filing in the early 1980s.
   Mr. Rice said he expects to meet with provincial and
federal government officials to discuss the proposed move.
   "Our advice is we're not in violation of the accords," he
said. "Reasonable negotiations between reasonable people
produce reasonable agreements."
   While the agreement doesn't provide for any specific
penalties, should Varity relocate to the U.S., such a move
would require approval by two-thirds of the company's common,
Class I preferred and Class II preferred shares, voting
separately. The federal government owns 1,250,000 of the two
million Class II preferred shares, and the remainder is held
by the Ontario government.
   Varity also announced plans to slash its debt and offer
cash incentives to encourage holders of Class I preferred to
convert their shares to common stock. Varity holders voted to
approve a special resolution, authorizing the board to offer
such inducements, which Mr. Rice said directors could develop
within the next few weeks.
   Removing the Class I preferred shares would eliminate
US$15 million in annual dividend payments, Varity said, and
probably would reduce the short position in Varity's common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange. A short position is
that held by an investor who sells stock that he doesn't yet
own by borrowing it from a broker to deliver to the
purchaser, hoping to make a profit by buying an equal number
of shares later at a lower price to replace the borrowed
stock.
   A large number of holders of the Class I preferred shares,
which are convertible into common stock at a ratio of 6.8493
to 1, have shorted the underlying common to provide security
for their investment, while still collecting the dividend on
the preferred. At July 13, Varity's short position was more
than 13 million shares.
   But Mr. Rice said Varity probably won't begin paying
dividends on common shares for at least two years, or until
the company's debt-to-equity ratio is close to the level of a
year ago, before its US$577.3 million acquisition of
Detroit-based K-H Corp. last October.
   "A large share" of Varity's free cash and proceeds from
any asset sales will go toward reducing about US$765.6
million of long-term debt by about US$150 million this year,
Mr. Rice said.
   Analysts said that most of the measures announced
yesterday had been anticipated, and that Varity stock
probably won't rise in value substantially until the
preferred shares are redeemed. In Big Board composite
trading, Varity common shares closed at US$3, unchanged.
