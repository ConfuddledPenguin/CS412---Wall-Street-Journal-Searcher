   DENVER -- OEA Inc. said it reached an out-of-court
settlement with the Colorado Department of Health that
allowed the maker of explosive and propellant devices to
resume production last Sunday.
   OEA had suspended operations last week, after the state
agency sued the company, alleging violations of the Colorado
Hazardous Waste Act. The settlement requires OEA to change
its handling of waste water, but the company said the changes
won't have a material effect on its finances.
