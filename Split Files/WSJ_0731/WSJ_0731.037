   NEW YORK -- The dollar slumped yesterday to its lowest
level against the mark in nearly 31 months, weighed down by
rising interest rates overseas and signs of a slowing economy
at home.
   Late in New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6041 marks
and 147.83 yen, down from 1.6120 marks and 149.15 yen late
Friday. Meanwhile, the British pound rose to $1.8470 from
$1.8375 on Friday.

   At its nadir yesterday, the dollar traded at 1.6023 marks,
its lowest level since Jan. 4, 1988, when the dollar briefly
touched 1.5615 marks, its lowest level since the modern
exchange rate-system was established after World War II.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 147.65 yen; it closed in Tokyo Monday at 148.60 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6058
marks, down from Tokyo's Monday close of 1.6128 marks.
   "We feel {the dollar} has got further to go down," said
Joe Scott-Plummer, joint managing director at Martin Currie
Ltd., an Edinburgh, Scotland, money manager.
   Analysts said the U.S. currency is caught in a vise.
Interest rates in Europe and Japan have been rising as major
foreign economies -- especially those of West Germany and
Japan -- are booming. At the same time, a softening U.S.
economy is raising the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates.
   "It seems we're heading into a recession or a moderate
slowdown, which would imply lower U.S. interest rates," said
Ian Spence, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
"In conjunction with that, it appears that Europe --
particularly Germany -- is on a roll with a booming economy
and opportunity for investment."
   Lower U.S. rates, combined with higher rates overseas,
generally hurt the dollar by reducing its allure to
international investors and speculators. The dollar is also
burdened by big U.S. budget and trade deficits.
   Although U.S. stocks and bonds rose yesterday, analysts
and money managers warned that the weakening U.S. currency is
damping foreign investors' appetites for dollar-denominated
securities. Foreign investors have never held the same sway
over the U.S. stock market as they have over the bond market,
but Japanese and British investors at times do influence U.S.
share prices.
   Traders said there was scant buying of U.S. bonds by
Japanese investors yesterday. This comes as other foreign
investors are generally shunning U.S. markets in favor of
either high-yielding fixed-income securities abroad or
foreign stock markets.
   In the first quarter, foreign investors dumped a net $3.3
billion of U.S. stocks and $900 million of American bonds,
according to the Security Industry Association. The Japanese
alone unloaded $700 million of U.S. shares and $3.9 billion
of U.S. Treasury securities. Analysts say that evidence
points to the trend continuing in the second quarter.
   "All the Japanese money that had been heading into the
U.S. is either heading for Europe or remaining at home in
Japan," said Mr. Spence.
   Yesterday, the dollar in intraday trading also tumbled to
a 30-month low against the Swiss franc and nearly a 20-month
low against the British pound.
   For Americans, a weakening currency is a double-edged
sword. It can help to lower the U.S. trade deficit by
reducing the prices of U.S. exports while boosting the prices
of foreign imports purchased by American consumers. At the
same time, however, higher import prices contribute to U.S.
inflation by allowing domestic companies that compete with
foreigners to raise prices.
   If the dollar fell far enough, it could also make it more
expensive for the U.S. to finance its budget deficit. That's
because foreign investors would demand higher yields on
Treasury securities to compensate for the weakened dollar.
Those higher rates, in turn, might damage U.S. economic
growth.
   While the dollar has been weakening for several weeks,
traders and analysts say that the U.S. currency was hurt by
last Friday's Commerce Department report that the U.S.
economy grew at an anemic annual inflation-adjusted rate of
1.2% in the second quarter -- down from 1.7% in the first
quarter.
   Traders saw the report as evidence that U.S. interest
rates will fall further and the dollar with them. By
contrast, the West German and Japanese economies each zoomed
at annual rates of 10.4% in the first quarter.
   But it is the rising gap between U.S. and foreign interest
rates that is the biggest factor driving down the dollar,
analysts said. In the past year, yields on three-month
Eurodollar deposits -- dollar deposits held offshore -- have
fallen to 7.88% from 8.55%. Meanwhile, yields on equivalent
mark deposits have jumped to 8.24% from 6.84%, and those on
equivalent yen deposits have climbed to 7.69% from 5.32%.
   "It's the expectation that U.S. rates will continue to go
lower in the second half of the year, and we expect rates in
Germany and Japan to rise," said Nigel Randell, an
international economist at James Capel &amp; Co. in London. "With
that as a background, there is little reason to be buying the
dollar aggressively."
   There is an even greater gap between U.S. and British
interest rates; threemonth Eurosterling rates currently stand
at 15.08%, up from 13.75% a year ago.
   "With something like a 15% yield, you can't go wrong" with
sterling, said George Kuster, a portfolio manager at Gulf &amp;
Occidental Investments S.A. in Geneva, who is also buying
French bonds, Swiss franc bonds issued by foreign
corporations and German time deposits. Mr. Kuster said that
only 3% to 5% of the portfolios he manages are in
dollar-denominated investments.
   Japan's money supply is expanding at a rapid annual rate
of 12.6%. And many analysts predict that West German
inflation will grow along with the increased expenditures
associated with the monetary union between East and West
Germany.
   Mr. Randell predicts that Japan will raise its official
discount rate -- which the central bank charges on loans to
financial institutions -- by 1/2 or 3/4 percentage point from
its current 5.25% level "over the next couple of months." He
also forecasts that after German rates remain stable for a
few months, West Germany will push them higher in October.
   Higher rates abroad would mean more pressure on the dollar
and could even prompt the Federal Reserve to prop up the
dollar by raising U.S. rates.
   The weakening dollar has made Martin Currie, the Edinburgh
money-management company, pessimistic about buying U.S.
stocks. For its non-dollar based investors, the company's
U.S. stock holdings currently represent about 80% to 85% of
what they would be if the firm's portfolios were weighted to
reflect the value of the U.S. market relative to the rest of
the world. That's down from roughly a 135% weighting six
months ago. The capitalization of the U.S. stock market is
about 34% of the world's market, according to Morgan Stanley
Capital International.
   Said Mr. Scott-Plummer of Martin Currie: "While we aren't
bearish on the U.S. stock market, we feel any returns {there}
could be eliminated by the weakness of the U.S. dollar."
   Roberto Bianchi, a first vice president at Union Bank of
Switzerland in Zurich, noted that investors who were selling
dollars yesterday were buying mostly high-yielding currencies
such as the pound, Spanish peseta and Italian lira. He
predicted that in the next week or two, the dollar could
tumble another 2% to 3% against the mark, bring it to its
record lows against the German currency.
   And the Martin Currie company sees the dollar falling an
additional 7% against the yen to 135 yen over the next five
to six months.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August
delivery settled at $367.80 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a heavy five million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$368.55 an ounce.
