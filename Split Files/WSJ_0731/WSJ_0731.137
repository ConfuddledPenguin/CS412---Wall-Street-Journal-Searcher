   SINGAPORE -- A group of Southeast Asian nations warned
that world-wide trade talks appear headed for failure, which
would increase international tensions and could leave them
"out in the cold."
   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, in a
statement critical of the lack of progress in the 105-nation
trade talks known as the Uruguay Round, said "the possibility
that the round will end in failure does not now seem
unthinkable." The talks conclude in early December and if an
agreement isn't reached, the statement added, "We are
concerned that deals will be struck" by the industrial
countries at the expense of developing nations.

   The Asean countries, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, are meeting here as part
of a larger group, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation,
which includes the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, New
Zealand and South Korea. In a separate statement on the trade
talks, Apec, which was formed last year to discuss common
problems in the Pacific region, "expressed grave concern that
progress has not been made."
   The flagging trade negotiations have heightened the
concern of many Asian nations that events in the West will
interfere with their efforts to expand trade. The Asians
worry that the move toward a single European market in 1992
could result in a restrictive trade bloc and that the West's
new preoccupation with Eastern Europe will divert investment
capital that might have found its way to Asia.
   Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in his opening
address at the Apec meeting, reflected this growing feeling
of isolation. Noting that British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher in a recent speech divided trading nations into
three groups based on the mark, the dollar and the yen, Mr.
Lee said such talk makes Asians feel "quarantined into the
Japanese yen bloc so that they can be excluded from the
markets of prosperous Europeans and Americans, that the
whites have changed the rules just as Asians have learned to
compete and win under those rules."
   A four-day negotiating session of the Uruguay Round in
Geneva ended last week without any signs of progress. The
talks are bogged down in disputes over agricultural trade and
subsidies, which hurt many Apec members.
   On Monday, the European Community's agriculture
commissioner proposed a 30% cut in Europe's farm subsidy over
five years. The U.S. said it wouldn't respond to the proposal
because it was made outside the Uruguay Round.
   The negotiators have only about four months to wrap up a
new set of trade rules covering agriculture, services,
textiles, agreements on mechanisms that would resolve trade
disputes, and other issues.
   Secretary of State James Baker, in a statement, told other
Apec members that "the highest international economic policy
priority of the U.S. is a successful outcome to the Uruguay
Round." Mr. Baker's remarks were read by Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher because the secretary of state was bedridden
with a fever, according to Margaret Tutwiler, the State
Department spokeswoman. But he is expected to leave Singapore
today, as planned, to continue an Asian trip.
   During the 1980s, U.S. trade with Pacific nations greatly
outstripped America's trade with Europe. In 1989, U.S.
trans-Pacific trade totaled $297 billion, compared with total
trade of $207 billion with Europe, according to a State
Department official.
   At yesterday's session, the Apec members also discussed
expanding their ranks to include China, Taiwan and Hong Kong,
but they aren't expected to make a decision during today's
final session, according to a senior U.S. official.
