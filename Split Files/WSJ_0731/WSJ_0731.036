   HONG KONG -- When the White House announced late last
month that it was renewing China's most-favored-nation status
in part because "Hong Kong should not be the innocent victim
of our disappointment with the Chinese administration," folks
here were happily surprised.
   True enough, the Hong Kong card is being used largely as a
club to beat back charges of a Bush kowtow and fend off
congressional efforts to overturn his most-favored-nation
decision. But many here hope this development and the
resolution passed last week in support of Hong Kong citizens
signal a new appreciation in Washington for America's
enormous stake in the colony's future.

   While most American images of Hong Kong revolve around
sweatshops and Suzie Wong, this Asian dragon has matured into
an international financial center that is the U.S.'s
14th-largest trading partner, the regional base for American
firms in Southeast Asia and the home to some $6 billion in
U.S. investment -- more than twice the U.S. investment in all
China.
   In the run-up to the 1997 handover of sovereignty to
Beijing, these critical American interests are jeopardized by
the steady erosion of confidence, whose most visible symptom
is the unprecedented exodus of Hong Kong residents to any
free nation that will give them a passport. The more than 900
U.S. firms here have been especially hard hit by the outflow
because of U.S. immigration laws that make these companies
less attractive in this area than their competitors. For all
these reasons, American businessmen are hoping that the
president's defense of Hong Kong is a sign that at this
critical time the U.S. is waking up to what it stands to lose
here.
   "The MFN statement was the first time Hong Kong has
figured in a U.S. foreign-policy decision since World War
II," says John Kamm, president of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham). "Hong Kong is an American
outpost, a fact only dimly perceived in Washington."
   Indeed, counting one way, the U.S. owns the largest
outside investment in Hong Kong (the Japanese also have a
claim) and thus stands to be the biggest loser if Hong Kong
crumbles. Despite this, notes Mr. Kamm, in last year's
congressional debate on China sanctions, Hong Kong was not
mentioned once. If Congress overrides the most-favored-nation
renewal, the decision could cost the territory $10 billion in
business, at least 20,000 jobs, and 2% to 3% off its gross
domestic product.
   For these economic reasons, the British welcomed AmCham's
intercession in the most-favored-nation debate on behalf of
Hong Kong. But they are leery of American political interest
because they understand clearly what few Americans or Britons
will say openly: Through conflicting interests, Britain is
undermining the American stake in Hong Kong. Britain itself
has little real stake here. Its real interest is to get out
as quietly as possible, and without being obliged to grant
passports to the Hong Kong Chinese. By contrast, America's $6
billion investment and use of the territory as a base for
Asian trade mean U.S. interests are closely aligned with
those of Hong Kong's people: keeping the place as free and
open as it is now.
   Contrary to the British line, the crisis of confidence had
set in well before the massacre in Tiananmen Square. For
American companies in Hong Kong, this dissatisfaction
translates into a staggering 30% average annual turnover in
staff, as employees scurry for refuge. The problem is
compounded by a restrictive U.S. immigration policy that has
virtually no room for business sponsorship of key employees.
When the U.S. is aiming to put immigration on more of a
skills basis, allowing U.S. firms abroad to sponsor
immigrants would make immigration more market-oriented and
give these firms a competitive edge in labor markets. In Hong
Kong the absence of such a program is proving painful.
   While the British would welcome changes in U.S.
immigration law that would help companies retain people in
Hong Kong, they're reluctant to grant Americans any say over
the policies that brought about the crisis in the first
place. Americans are not appointed in significant numbers to
any of the consultative committees that are an important part
of running the colony, have almost no representation in the
all-important civil service, and are virtually invisible on
the general commission of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce.
   Even today, when the Hong Kong government's official line
is to favor more U.S. involvement, Americans are more likely
to get lucrative contracts than a voice. Already, America is
the largest supplier to the Hong Kong government. U.S.
companies stand to come out on top in the bidding for $2.6
billion of infrastructure upgrades, including a new airport
and the doubling of port facilities.
   In the short term these contracts might make a number of
companies very rich, but they won't do much to build
confidence. The threat to Hong Kong's continued prosperity is
not economic but political. As long as the British
authorities continue to do the mainland's bidding, Hong
Kong's people will continue to doubt, while the potential for
violence will increase.
   The American business community recognizes this -- in
October 1988 AmCham lobbied Beijing for stronger human-rights
guarantees for post-1997 Hong Kong -- but U.S. executives
have been silent about Britain's refusal to protect Hong
Kong.
   Business leaders say that the next two years will be the
critical test, and without pressure from Washington the
British and mainland Chinese are likely to continue down the
same destructive path. At House hearings in June on
most-favored-nation status, concern for Hong Kong was voiced
again, not only by the White House but by Sen. Robert Dole
(R., Kan.), Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.) and Rep. John
Porter (R., Ill.). As Hong Kong lurches toward 1997, the U.S.
government would do well to keep two overriding principles in
mind: that Hong Kong is most valuable to the U.S. as it
exists today, and that even if Hong Kong is destined to go
the way of Shanghai, its people should find a new home for
their talent and entrepreneurship in the U.S. -- not Canada
or Australia.
   "America has a lot more at risk here than Britain," says
the leader of the newly formed United Democrats of Hong Kong,
Martin Lee. "The question these American businessmen have to
start asking themselves is, `Is Britain's handling of the
political situation in Hong Kong in America's best
interests?'"
