   George Plimpton is at it again. The only editor of a
pretentious, money-losing literary magazine ever to risk
having his teeth knocked down his throat while playing pro
football, Mr. Plimpton has written "The X Factor" (Whittle,
85 pages, $11.95), a book about his latest adventures as a
jock: a series of horseshoes matches with George Bush. This
man fears nothing.
   Except losing. Edged out in a match in which Mr. Bush
continually bellowed, "Remember Iowa]" -- a reference to his
nearly fatal 1988 primary defeat in what has become the most
important state in the Union -- Mr. Plimpton sets out on a
voyage of spiritual self-discovery, seeking to find the X
Factor, that elusive psychological edge that all great
champions possess. He hopes he can find it "in a small,
earthenware jug corked at its mouth."

   His quest takes him to the homes of such proven champs as
tennis star Billie Jean King, Green Bay Packers Hall of Famer
Willie Davis, and the short but muscular leveraged-buy-out
specialist Henry Kravis. These people give him predictable
advice: Go for the throat, don't quit, never give a sucker an
even break, screw management.
   But his travels also take him to the home of Peter
Buterakos, a cemetery-plot salesman from Flint, Mich., who
advises him to show up at Mr. Bush's house with his own
horse, knock it to the ground, wrench the horseshoes from its
flailing feet, and use those in the rematch. Let's just see
what Mr. Bush makes of that. Actually, it isn't clear how
much of this stuff Mr. Plimpton is making up. An adroit
dissembler who once fooled zillions of Sports Illustrated's
subscribers when he published an idiotic but plausible story
about a flame-throwing New York Mets pitching phenom named
Sidd Finch, Mr. Plimpton seems to have invented the George
Bush material, but actually gone to see Mr. Kravis, Ms. King
and all the rest.
   Whether he's lying all the way through, or he actually did
crisscross the globe seeking what the Soviets call "the white
moment," what Tibetans call "lung-fom," or what Joe Garagiola
calls "being in the zone," Mr. Plimpton has written a dandy
book.
   "The X Factor" is one of those 85-page affairs that
Whittle Communications publishes every few months as part of
its "Larger Agenda" series, and it is filled with two-page
color ads for Federal Express. So you actually only have to
read about 65 pages of stuff about horseshoes, which is
probably right at the limit anyway. The 65 pages are quite
good, particularly Mr. Plimpton's suggestion that American
Express Co. President James D. Robinson III rethink his plans
to have "Quality" etched on his tombstone, and instead use
the words, "I Left Home Without It."
   Equally funny are quotes from two of our finest
sportscasters: former St. Louis Cardinals catcher Tim
McCarver, who believes that "the mind is a great thing as
long as you don't have to use it," and former Oakland Raiders
football coach John Madden, who has often declared, "Don't
worry about the horse being blind; load up the wagon."

   John Buckley has loaded up the wagon, and the horse is
quite, quite blind. Like "The X Factor," "Statute of
Limitations" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 365 pages, $19.95) deals with
a president of the U.S., but this time it's a man whose
administration is imperiled by revelations that one of his
speechwriters has been bribed by a drug-dealing boyhood
friend into smuggling 44 pounds of cocaine out of Venezuela
and onto Air Force One.
   Mr. Buckley's book obviously was inspired by reefer-toking
Douglas Ginsburg's aborted nomination to the Supreme Court,
and, as such, it has the feel of yesterday's news tomorrow,
today's news yesterday, or last month's news a week from
Thursday. Mr. Buckley, a Washington political consultant who
has become a walking sound bite, tries to fashion a novel out
of wisecracks, using it as a forum to tee off on people or
institutions -- including the Washington Post -- that he does
not like. When you write sentences such as, "Her eyes still
had the Hyperborean mirth of a prankster," you should be very
careful whom you tee off on.
   A man who elevated himself to the spotlight as press
secretary for presidential candidate Jack Kemp while Mr.
Blow-Dry was going down the tubes, Mr. Buckley's political
savvy is in serious doubt: My advance copy of "Statute of
Limitations" includes passages about Presidents Mario Vargas
Llosa of Peru and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, suggesting that
the book is past its expiration date. Moreover, the novel is
set in an America ruled by a Democratic president and a
Republican Congress. What year is this, anyway? 2240?
   The book has a desperately hip quality, as the author
endlessly drops the names of rock bands he apparently liked
when he used to work for a New York countercultural
newspaper, the SoHo Weekly News, in the late 1970s. Uh-oh.
When young Republicans who are former press secretaries to
Jack Kemp start raving about the Dead Kennedys, the Sex
Pistols, the Clash, and Richard Hell &amp; the Voidoids, it's
clear that rock 'n' roll has forfeited all claims to being a
subversive art form.
   As to the drugs, I agree with the author that it is wrong
to condemn baby boomers for the indiscretions of their infant
years at college. But I do approve of random testing for
novelists who write sentences such as, "If the air hadn't
been so soft as to reverse engines on even the most
plummeting of manic depressives, he might have been thrown
into a funk." If that won't throw you into a funk, nothing
will.
