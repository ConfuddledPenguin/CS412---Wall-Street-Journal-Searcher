   MOSCOW -- The Soviet military, facing a growing generation
gap within its ranks, is preparing to take tentative steps
toward an all-volunteer force.
   The Ministry of Defense will ask the Supreme Soviet, the
nation's legislature, for money this fall to begin
contracting for skilled sailors who volunteer to serve
three-year terms in the Soviet navy, a spokesman said. The
new volunteers will be paid 200 rubles a month, 20 times the
pay of sailors who are drafted and a level that approaches
the average Soviet worker's pay. At the same time, the
spokesman said, the navy will drop the service period for
conscripted sailors to two years from three.

   The Defense Ministry's position is a compromise between
older generals and admirals, who oppose any changes in the
draft system, and a rising group of younger officers, such as
30-year-old Maj. Vladimir Lopotin, who are pushing for rapid
change to a smaller, all-volunteer force.
   In the formerly rigid hierarchy of the Soviet military the
top brass would win, hands down. But Maj. Lopotin and his
allies have outflanked their commanders, establishing a
beachhead in the Supreme Soviet, which must decide the issue.
   Maj. Lopotin, a political commissar in the Russian
merchant marines, was recently named by the Supreme Soviet's
defense committee to head a commission that is drawing up a
list of needed reforms, and the all-volunteer force is one of
the main proposals. "It is best," says Maj. Lopotin, who sees
Soviet forces some day operating as allies with U.S. troops
in a revised North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Working with him, he says, are a core group of 20 younger
officers who serve as elected members of the Supreme Soviet
or, like Maj. Lopotin, as elected members of the larger
Congress of Peoples' Deputies, which meets less frequently.
   Despite their political powers, the major says, this is
still a dangerous game for the young officers. "The military
leadership is now rooting out dissidents in the army, using
the pretext of reduction of military forces to give the sack
to anyone who doesn't agree with them," he says.
   The result, he worries, could be a much more conservative
military. "If part of the military falls to the bait and
joins with the most conservative part of the society, they
together would become a most dangerous force. It gives
conservatives more chances to turn society back to the past.
This is dangerous not only to the U.S.S.R. but to the whole
world."
   The major contributor to the growing unrest in the
military, he says, is the reluctance of the Soviet military
hierarchy to provide housing for some 300,000 families of
officers who have left the services. Recently, the government
announced that it is the job of local communities to find
housing for returning officers.
   This is unacceptable, Maj. Lopotin says, because it pits
the needs of the officers against the needs of the poor. His
group is lobbying to have housing funds come out of the
military budget.
   Little is known here about the costs of an all-volunteer
force, and discussion of reform proposals is prohibited
within the military. Outside groups, such as the Institute of
the U.S.A. and Canada, have been studying the U.S. shift from
the draft in the late 1970s.
   Olga Pobortseva, a researcher at the institute, was sent
to the Brookings Institution in Washington this spring to
study the U.S. experience. "I think our congress will approve
some sort of all-volunteer army," she says, noting that a
smaller Soviet force must rely more on skilled soldiers for
high-technology weaponry.
   Citing a recent shortfall in army conscription, especially
from the Baltic and Central Asian republics, she asserts: "It
is stupid to draft those who don't want to serve and to make
those resign who want to stay in."
   Pvt. K. Avilov, a Muscovite drafted into the Soviet army
in the fall of 1988, says the experience convinced him that
the army should be further reorganized along ethnic lines to
prevent racial strife, which, he says, makes life a
"permanent war" within the enlisted ranks. Writing in the
magazine Ogonyok, Pvt. Avilov says he found a "very
oppressive situation" in his regiment, which was sent to stop
ethnic fighting in the Caucasus last winter.
   The force, he said, broke down into ethnic gangs that
often fought each other. Officers didn't punish the
ringleaders, he wrote; rather, they tried to cool off
passions by having the troops stand in the frost in their
shorts. Such cruelty, he said, "might destroy the army from
inside."
   Vadim Bakatin, who heads the Soviet Ministry of Internal
Affairs, also favors the all-volunteer format for his MVD
troops, whose primary mission is to curb ethnic fighting. In
a recent newspaper interview, he said he has asked the
Supreme Soviet for additional money to shift away from the
use of draftees.
