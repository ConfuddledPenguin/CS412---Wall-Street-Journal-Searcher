   LITERACY IN BRITAIN

   One in four young adults in Britain has difficulty reading
and writing, according to a new survey.
   The survey of 1,000 people ranging in age from 16 to 20
years old found that 35% had difficulties spelling and 43%
rarely or never read books. Nine percent rarely or never read
newspapers or magazines, the survey found.
   Another finding was that 94% of adults with literacy
problems had not received any help since they were 16 years
old.
   The survey was commissioned by Director, the monthly
magazine of the Institute of Directors, one of Britain's
largest organizations for business people. Director said the
survey showed "an enormous waste of human resources and an
unnecessary burden on the British economy."
                                                                                                       

   MISSION TO BEIJING
                                                                                                       

   A Japanese government mission arrived in Beijing yesterday
to begin bilateral discussions on resumption of Japanese aid
to China. The talks will focus on specific projects proposed
by China for financing, said a spokesman for Japan's Foreign
Ministry. If the mission returns with a favorable report,
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund will send staff to
China for working-level talks on the aid, the spokesman said.
                                                                                                       

   BURDEN OF EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   East Germany's financial problems will mean at least an
extra 30 billion marks ($18.47 billion) in expenses this year
for the West German government, according to a report in the
weekly Der Spiegel magazine. The extra money is needed in
budgets ranging from health insurance to unemployment,
according to the article. The magazine also said that the 10
billion marks offered to East German companies having trouble
meeting their bills is proving to be far from enough and that
20 billion marks more will be needed in August and September.
                                                                                                       

   DEATH IN AUSTRALIA
                                                                                                       

   Responding to a spate of robberies by criminals
brandishing syringes believed to be filled with AIDS-infected
blood, John Dowd, attorney-general of Australia's New South
Wales state, said the state planned to change the law
governing murder charges. "There is a common-law rule that
the death must occur within a year and a day," Mr. Dowd said,
adding that people with AIDS "usually die more than a year
after contracting the disease." Mr. Dowd said he was also
considering strengthening penalties for AIDS carriers who had
sexual intercourse without informing their partner of their
condition.
                                                                                                       

   SPAIN'S TOURISM SLUMP
                                                                                                       

   Tourism revenue in Spain slipped 8.5% in the first six
months of 1990 to 777.8 billion pesetas ($7.81 billion) from
850.1 billion pesetas a year earlier, the Tourism Secretariat
said. More than 20 million tourists visited Spain in the
first half of the year, slightly more than in the first six
months of 1989 when 18.9 million tourists vacationed there.
Most analysts agree that the Spanish peseta's appreciation
against European and U.S. currencies has been key to the
weaker tourism earnings.
                                                                                                       

   CIGARETTE SMUGGLING IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   Authorities in China's coastal provinces are reportedly
struggling to deal with burgeoning cigarette smuggling. In
the coastal province of Fujian alone, authorities handled
50,000 instances of smuggling of imported cigarettes in the
first half of 1990 -- four times more than in the same period
last year, the Economic Daily said. Each case of imported
cigarettes smuggled into China represents a loss of 1,500
yuan ($316) in taxes for the state, the paper said. Last
year, as many as one million cases of cigarettes were
smuggled into China, the newspaper said.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIET SHORTAGES
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Union could face extensive food shortages
because farmers are bartering an expected record harvest for
tools and machinery instead of selling their crops to the
state, Pravda reported.
   Farmers wanted to barter crops directly with factories and
cut the state out of their financial dealings, the Communist
Party daily said. Collective farms had sold only 18% of the
total harvest to the state as of July 23, it said.
   The low level of sales to the state has caused alarm
because most grain is produced in only three republics -- the
Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine. "It is
alarming because if the three republics do not sell enough
grain there will be a deficit for the other 12 republics in
the country," Pravda said.
   The 1990 grain harvest is expected to exceed the 1978
record of 237 million tons, according to experts quoted last
week in the government newspaper Izvestia.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   In Italy, Pisa's newly elected Mayor Sergio Cortopassi
said he is appealing to Premier Giulio Andreotti in hopes of
spurring a start to work on the Leaning Tower, closed to the
public in January. Parliament hasn't yet appropriated the
$400 million experts estimate is needed to keep the tower
from toppling. . . . Prague's chief prosecutor, Tomas Sokol,
reportedly said the city was unsafe at night and called for
registration of prostitutes. In an interview with the Mlada
Fronta daily, he said, "We have to realize there are 20,000
prostitutes in Prague." Prague's population is 1.2 million.
