   HONG KONG -- NEC Corp., one of Japan's top computer
makers, and Capital Iron &amp; Steel Complex, China's leading
steel producer, are expected next month to sign an agreement
to set up a $150 million venture to produce integrated
circuits, the English-language China Daily reported.
   The planned Beijing factory is to be capable of producing
50 million integrated circuits a year, the paper said, but
didn't provide further details.

   When NEC outlined the project last January, it said Japan
would first have to lift economic sanctions it imposed on
China following the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989.
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, at the economic summit
meeting in Houston this month, obtained the understanding of
other major industrial countries to resume economic relations
with China, and this apparently cleared the way for the NEC
project to proceed.
