   TOKYO -- The U.S. and Japan appear headed toward a trade
clash over a complaint by Allied-Signal Inc., despite efforts
by the two countries to settle the issue.
   U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators will meet Wednesday
for the fourth time since April, when Allied-Signal agreed to
suspend a complaint that Japan has blocked its efforts to
sell amorphous metal alloys to Japanese utilities. Amorphous
metals are an advanced material now used mostly to improve
the efficiency of electrical power lines, but engineers say
the material could ultimately have a broad range of
industrial applications.

   The U.S. had persuaded Allied-Signal to withdraw the
complaint for 150 days so the issue wouldn't undermine the
Bush administration's efforts to defuse U.S.-Japan trade
tensions. At the time, the two countries were involved in a
sweeping set of talks on so-called structural impediments to
trade. Those talks ended in late June, with Japan agreeing to
make its markets more accessible to foreigners.
   But, in separate interviews, U.S. and Japanese officials
concede that the two sides remain far apart on the amorphous
metals issue, and are doubtful of making headway soon. "We
were persuaded by many of the U.S. arguments" during the
recent talks on structural impediments to trade, says one
Japanese official. "We're not persuaded on this" one.
   Allied-Signal doesn't seem to be doing any better in its
private talks with Japanese companies. David Hill, senior
vice president in charge of the Morristown, N.J., company's
engineered materials sector, says Japanese utility industry
executives in recent meetings have shown little interest in
buying from the U.S. concern.
   If the disagreement isn't settled by Sept. 15,
Allied-Signal is expected to renew its formal action, which
could lead to retaliatory measures under U.S. trade law.
   Allied-Signal estimates the annual market for metal used
in transformers in Japan at $100 million, but it isn't clear
how much of that market amorphous metals would capture. Even
in the U.S., only 5% of new transformers use the material,
though the proportion is growing.
   Allied-Signal has charged that Japan for years
systematically blocked its efforts to sell in that market,
while encouraging Japanese companies to develop amorphous
metals technology. A Japanese government agency organized and
financed a group of 34 companies to develop a competitive
product. The group was able to use information in a patent
application filed by Allied-Signal in Tokyo in the late 1970s
but not approved for more than a decade, the company says.
   Now, with less than three years left on the patent,
Allied-Signal and U.S. officials believe Japanese utilities
are stalling on decisions to buy amorphous-metal transformers
so that they can buy from Japanese suppliers after the patent
expires.
   "There's ample evidence to support the conclusion that
they are holding the market closed until they can produce it
themselves," says a U.S. trade official. The U.S. side has
suggested remedies, including extension of the patent or
government steps, such as official endorsement of the
technology, to encourage purchases.
   But Japanese negotiators say they continue to believe that
Allied-Signal's inability to sell is the result of
independent business decisions by the utilities, not an
orchestrated boycott.
   Should Allied-Signal reinstate its complaint in September,
the U.S. Trade Representative's office would have roughly six
months to settle the dispute with Japan, or to select
retaliatory measures designed to limit Japanese access to
U.S. markets.
