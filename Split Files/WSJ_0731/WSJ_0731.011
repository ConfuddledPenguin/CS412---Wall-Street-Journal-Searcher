   LOS ANGELES -- Guardian Bancorp said it will periodically
purchase as many as 75,000 of its common shares in the open
market or in unsolicited private transactions at market
prices.
   Paul M. Harris, chairman, said the holding company for
Guardian Bank believes that at current levels, the stock is
undervalued.
