   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilians don't play baseball, so they
worry little about who's on first. But they're passionate
about soccer, and they wonder who's in first. First place,
that is.
   "In the end, who is the champion?" asked the headline in
Monday's Jornal do Brasil. Perplexed fans asked the same
question Sunday after watching both Botafogo and Vasco da
Gama run victory laps after their game at Maracana Stadium,
the 200,000-seat temple of soccer.

   On the face of it, it was simple. Botafogo won the game,
1-0, and has more points overall this season than Vasco.
   But this is Brazil, and nothing is ever that simple. Rules
are rules and, apparently, the rules say Botafogo may have
been the best team overall and won the final, but it didn't
win the championship. That's if you believe the rules that
were adopted in midseason, which aren't the same as the rules
that were enforced at the beginning of the season.
   Under the old rules, the soccer season is divided into two
legs, one won by Vasco and another won by a third team,
Fluminense; Vasco won the playoff between the two. On top of
that, however, if another team has more overall wins than the
two champions when the two legs of the season are combined,
it also has a right to dispute the prestigious championship
of the state of Rio de Janeiro. That was Botafogo's case, so
it had to play Vasco to determine the championship.
Botafogo's victory Sunday sealed the matter, so far as its
players and fans were concerned.
   But the rules were changed during this season's recess for
the World Cup, when the Soccer Federation decided that the
winner would be determined by a point system. Under that
system, Botafogo and Vasco were tied with one victory apiece
at the end of regulation time in Sunday's game and should
have played an overtime period to determine the overall
winner.
   Botafogo refused and left the field after a victory
celebration, so Vasco dubbed itself "the legal winner"
despite its defeat. "The rules exist and we complied with
them," proclaims Eurico Miranda, Vasco's vice president.
   Which leaves the championship a matter for a court
decision, and Botafogo faces expulsion for refusing to comply
with the rules. A ruling is expected within 20 days, but
soccer fans may have to be patient: The last time there was a
dispute over the title was in 1907, and the final decision on
that didn't come until 1989.
