   Consolidated Enfield Corp. said it exercised rights
granted by Consumers Packaging Inc. to acquire an additional
4,529,781 common shares of the Toronto-based packaging
concern.
   The 39.6-million Canadian-dollar (US$34.2 million)
purchase brings Enfield's stake in Consumers Packaging to
57.6% from about 50%.

   Consumers Packaging said it intends to use the C$45.4
million proceeds of the rights issue to reduce corporate
debt.
   Enfield, a Toronto-based holding company indirectly
controlled by financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman, said the
acquisition was for investment purposes.
   Earlier this month, Enfield paid C$17.5 million to acquire
a block of 1,224,489 Consumers Packaging shares from a former
Enfield subsidiary, Federal Pioneer Ltd.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday,
Consumers Packaging closed at C$9, up 25 Canadian cents.
Shares of Consolidated Enfield closed at C$10, down C$1.50.
Before the rights offering, the company had about 20.8
million common shares outstanding.
