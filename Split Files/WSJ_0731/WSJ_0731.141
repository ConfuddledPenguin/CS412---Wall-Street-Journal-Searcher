   TOKYO -- Import and export contracts signed by Japan's
major trading houses in June edged lower from year-earlier
levels, an industry group said.
   Import contracts dropped 4.1% to 1.517 trillion yen
($10.18 billion) in June, after plunging 32.4% in May. The
May decline was the first year-on-year fall in import
contracts since October 1989.

   Export contracts for the month were almost unchanged from
year-earlier levels, edging down 0.4% to 1.079 trillion yen.
   An official of the Japan Foreign Trade Council said the
declines represent a reaction from high year-earlier levels.
He called the factors behind the declines temporary, saying
they don't suggest a reversal of the overall upward trend.
For the January-June half-year period, export contracts
climbed 18.8% from year-earlier levels, while import
contracts rose 12.8%.
   The June results reported by the council are based on
contract statistics provided by 18 major Japanese trading
companies and are widely considered to be short-term
indicators of overall trade trends. The trading companies
furnishing contract statistics account for roughly half of
Japan's general exports and about two-thirds of imports.
   The council said June was the first time in 26 months that
import contracts have fallen below year-earlier levels for
two consecutive months.
   Despite a 66.5% rise in fuel import contracts to 688.5
billion yen, almost all other product categories declined
from year-earlier levels, led by the machinery sector.
   The council said the 72.8% plunge in machinery-import
contracts to 72.5 billion yen was a reaction to the large
number of airline-import contracts signed the year before.
