   The heat was on, and Ronald M. Fino's precarious double
life was about to unravel.
   The devoted son of a high-ranking Buffalo mobster, Mr.
Fino had for 15 years headed that city's Local 210 of the
Laborers International Union of North America. During all
those years he had also been an informant for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, feeding the government evidence of
the union's ties to organized crime.

   Now, by late 1988, the mob had finally turned wary. A
Mafia official summoned Mr. Fino to a sit-down in the coffee
shop of Buffalo's Veterans Administration hospital. "I'm
going to have to frisk you," he told Mr. Fino.
   "I had known this man a long time," Mr. Fino recalls
today. "I said, `Shame on you.' He said, `Out of respect for
your father, I won't do it.'"
   The wire Mr. Fino was wearing that day -- in a pack of
cigarettes in his pocket -- went undetected. Nonetheless, the
mobster delivered a warning: "He told me," Mr. Fino says,
"that I couldn't be trusted any longer."
   Mr. Fino took heed. Soon afterward, he fled Buffalo,
assumed a new name and went into hiding, where he remains
today. So far, Mr. Fino's information has helped indict three
Local 210 officers, and has linked the Mafia to Laborers
union locals in other cities, says G. Robert Langford, the
FBI's Buffalo chief.
   As a prosecution witness, Mr. Fino will figure prominently
in the government's attempts to smash the Mafia leadership in
Buffalo and clamp a court trusteeship on Local 210 under
civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations, or RICO, law.
   "He was a very big help," says the FBI's Mr. Langford. "He
steered us in the right direction in a number of
investigations."
   In telling his story to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Fino
provides a rare account of a life and career shaped by his
Mafia birthright -- a legacy that he freely chose to betray.
It is a portrait of the informer's dangerous tightrope act:
of the duplicity, agility and nerve such a performance
demands, and of its aftermath of bitterness and fear.
   The government has in recent years come to rely heavily on
undercover informants to combat organized crime. The
imprisonment of numerous mob bosses under RICO has served to
weaken the Mafia's code of silence, long bred of fear and the
perception of invincibility. Stiff RICO penalties have
further eroded Mafia loyalties, giving mobsters and their
associates powerful incentive to cooperate in return for
lighter sentences.
   As an informant, Mr. Fino is something of an anomaly. He
never joined the Mafia; he declined an invitation to become a
member, though it came from the same reputed "capo" who
earlier had recruited his father. Nor was he coerced to
become an informant; he wasn't facing criminal charges when
he volunteered his services to the FBI. (Years later, while
working undercover, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in a
fraud case and received two years' probation.)
   Mr. Fino wasn't paid by the FBI during his years
undercover. He began receiving payments -- now $6,000 a month
-- from the bureau in March 1989 after agreeing to become a
prosecution witness in future trials. FBI agents accompany
him on plane trips and during court appearances. "We have
heard there is a price on his head, and we consider it a
valid threat," says the FBI's Mr. Langford.
   Mr. Fino, now 44, never relaxes his guard. When jogging,
he says, "if I see somebody who looks like a stranger,
somebody looks like he's checking me out, I report it to the
FBI."
   In Buffalo, Mr. Fino is denounced by Paul Cambria Jr., the
attorney for a Local 210 officer whom Mr. Fino has implicated
in a crime. For many years, Mr. Cambria contends, the FBI has
tried without success to brand Local 210 as mob-controlled.
"It looks as if this time they're going to attempt to prove
it by using Ron Fino," who, he says, "resigned from Local 210
probably because he was not able to take it over and run it
the way he would like to."
   Mr. Fino's personal life is in shambles. His wife, Donna,
to whom he never disclosed his FBI spying, divorced him last
November. His two brothers no longer speak to him. One of
them, Patrick Fino, says: "Shame on him because he left his
wife and kids." Fear for his own safety kept Ron Fino from
attending his mother's funeral in Buffalo last December.
   "I try to live a halfway normal life," he says. "But it's
difficult. I can't go and come like a normal person. The
toughest thing is my children -- I don't see them." His son,
19, and daughter, 17, live with their mother.
   Life in solitary exile is a far cry from his heady years
as a labor leader, when his salary and benefits totaled
$85,000 a year. There were union-supplied Cadillacs, trips to
Miami and Hawaii, bottles of Montrachet, friends in high
places.
   "Fino had a generally good reputation," says Dennis
Gorski, county executive of Erie County, where Buffalo is
situated. "He participated in a wide variety of civic and
humanitarian projects."
   A frequent fund-raiser for worthy causes, Mr. Fino was
honored by the Buffalo chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. And under his
leadership, Local 210 was part of a group that lent money for
downtown redevelopment projects, including construction of
Buffalo's Hyatt Regency hotel. "When Ron Fino gave his word,
to my knowledge he kept it," says Paul Snyder Sr., managing
director of the partnership that owns the Hyatt Regency.
   Some people in Buffalo are still puzzled why Mr. Fino
would forsake everything for the dubious privilege of
exposing Mafia crimes. One explanation is that he never
intended to pay so dearly. Another, perhaps, can be traced to
deep conflicts about his Mafia upbringing.
   "I could never get rid of the feeling that I was one of
them," Mr. Fino says. "You have this original sin that never
washes away.
   "It affected everything. In high school, I'd date a new
girl. Next time I called up for a date, her parents wouldn't
let her go out with me. They'd read about my father in the
paper."
   Milwaukee-born Joseph (Ebe) Fino worked as a bookie,
taking bets on horses and baseball. A 1963 U.S. Senate report
on organized crime traces his rise in the Buffalo Mafia from
"hoodlum status to upper-echelon rank." He was boss of the
Buffalo crime family from 1968 to 1972.
   For a time, according to the Senate report, Joe Fino
served as a Mafia enforcer. Once, his son says, the elder Mr.
Fino killed a man -- the lover of a mobster's unfaithful
wife. "The mob directed that the guy be killed, and my father
drew the assignment," Ron Fino says. The murder went
unsolved. Ron Fino says he never revealed his father's
involvement to outsiders until after Joe Fino died in 1984.
   Secrets and subterfuge were part of growing up in a Mafia
household. When Ron Fino was five, his mother took him to New
York's Attica state prison, where his father was serving time
for grand larceny. "She told me Attica was an Army fort, and
that we were going to visit my father in the Army," Mr. Fino
recalls.
   When he was 11, he watched his father pay off two
detectives at a restaurant. "I thought they were going to
arrest my father," Mr. Fino says. "But all they wanted was
their cut."
   Only gradually did it dawn on the boy that Joe Fino was a
member of the Mafia. Once, young Ron came home from school in
a novelty T-shirt inscribed: "World Order of Mafia. Paid-Up
Member." His father angrily demanded that he remove it. "I
couldn't understand what he was mad about," Mr. Fino says.
   By the time he was in high school, however, Ron Fino was
working weekends in a Mafia gambling parlor, tending dice
tables.
   To the family, "my father was a very caring man," Ron Fino
says. "He gave me money if I needed it. He never hit me -- I
never saw him hit anyone."
   Through his father's connections, Ron Fino joined Local
210 at age 18, working summers in construction while
attending college. He moved up quickly, and was elected Local
210's operating head and business manager in 1973, at age 27.
   Just as Ron Fino's star was rising, Joe Fino's began to
sink. He was perceived by the mob as ineffective, and in 1972
was removed as Buffalo chief by the Commission, the Mafia's
New York-based ruling council. As Mafia leaders looked the
other way, he began to lose customers to other bookies.
   Two years later, he wound up on the losing side of a
factional dispute that had split the Buffalo Mafia. Rumor had
it that he was to be killed. Ron Fino went to his father's
home and urged him to leave. "He wouldn't budge," Mr. Fino
says. "He said to relax. He didn't leave the house for three
days. Then it all blew over. Later I was told by Sam Pieri
that he saved my father's life."
   The late Mr. Pieri, a reputed Mafia "capo" and member of
the dominant faction, was an old friend who had recruited Joe
Fino into the Mafia. He invited Ron Fino to join as well --
three years after Mr. Fino had turned informant. "We were
driving back from Cleveland," Mr. Fino says, "when Sam Pieri
said it would be easy to introduce me as a `friend of ours,'
which meant, `Would you like to join?'" Mr. Fino says that
neither he nor his father, who didn't want him entangled with
the mob, favored the idea. "My father said, `Let me take care
of it.' And I never heard any more about it."
   By 1976, Joe Fino was reduced to taking handouts from his
son. When his father's four-bedroom suburban house burned
down, Ron Fino made the monthly payments on a new house. "All
the time he'd been in the mob, my father never had life
insurance, or medical insurance, and never provided for the
future," Ron Fino says. "Toward the end of his life, I
brought him into Local 210. I got him work as a laborer. I
said, `As a union member, you're entitled to a pension.' I
explained to him the strength of legitimacy."
   Ron Fino rode to election as business manager on a promise
of greater responsiveness to the local's 2,000 members. But
it soon became clear that his hands were tied. "After two
weeks on the job, I was told by the {Mafia} bosses who to put
on the union payroll and who would be involved in the benefit
funds," he says.
   "When deserving people came to me for jobs," Mr. Fino
adds, "I couldn't do anything for them." Instead of an
equitable hiring hall, he says, "there's a Who's Who list of
guys to be taken care of. If you're not on it, you're out of
luck." Mr. Fino insists that it was only after he was elected
union leader that he realized the full extent of mob
influence.
   The Washington-based Laborers International Union is aware
of FBI allegations that the Buffalo local is mob-controlled,
says Robert Connerton, general counsel of the international.
"If something is proven, the international is prepared to do
something about it," he says. Mr. Connerton adds that as
Local 210 leader, Ron Fino "probably did a good job. My
feeling was he was very bright, very flaky, some sort of
shadowy character, always by himself."
   Mr. Fino says that frustration over being a union
figurehead in thrall to mob bosses led him, shortly after his
election in 1973, to begin assisting the FBI. He was
recruited by an acquaintance, an FBI agent to whom he had
earlier voiced his contempt for the mob. The FBI urged him to
join the Mafia to better penetrate it. He refused, he says,
fearing that the mob might order him to kill someone.
   Even so, the FBI had a highly useful operative in Mr.
Fino. In 1976, he met with Anthony D. Liberatore, then
business agent for Cleveland Laborers Local 860. Mr.
Liberatore, according to a 1988 U.S. Senate report, is a
"capo" in the Cleveland Mafia.
   "Liberatore thought I was a member of the Buffalo family,
so he spoke freely," Mr. Fino says. "He told me the mob had a
leak into the FBI office in Cleveland -- someone in the FBI
feeding stuff to them. I was concerned. It meant the mob
would have access to the FBI computer, which had a list of
informants, including me."
   Mr. Fino reported the leak to the FBI. In 1978, an FBI
file clerk and her husband pleaded guilty in Cleveland to
receiving $15,000 from Mr. Liberatore in exchange for
confidential FBI files, including a list of informants. (Mr.
Fino's name apparently wasn't on the list.) The couple
received five-year prison sentences. Mr. Liberatore,
convicted in 1982 of racketeering and for his role in bribing
the FBI clerk, was recently released from prison.
   Mr. Fino and his FBI contact met secretly, often at night,
behind the Buffalo Bills' football stadium. "I told my wife
it was business," Mr. Fino says. "She accepted it."
   Once, a Mafioso spotted him sitting in an FBI agent's car
in broad daylight in downtown Buffalo. Mr. Fino was hauled
before Sam Frangiamore, who at the time was Buffalo's Mafia
chief, according to the FBI. "I told Frangiamore I was coming
out of the union hall when an FBI agent told me to get into
his car," Mr. Fino says. "I said I thought I was under
arrest, and that I told the FBI to go talk to my attorney.
Frangiamore accepted my explanation."
   Another time, the Mafia obtained FBI documents outlining
the bureau's surveillance of mob figures in Buffalo. The
documents, snatched from an FBI agent's unlocked car, were
brought to Local 210. Tipped by Mr. Fino, federal lawmen
barged into Local 210 and retrieved the papers.
   To deflect suspicion from himself, Mr. Fino told Mafia
leaders that the FBI knew of the documents' whereabouts
because they had bugged the union office. Knowing that the
mob would sweep his office, Mr. Fino bought a Radio Shack
transmitter and installed it in his office ceiling. The fake
bug was duly uncovered.
   The close calls took their toll, and by February 1988 Ron
Fino was burned out. He wanted to resume a normal life. He
told the FBI he would no longer serve as an informant and
resigned his job at Local 210. "The crime family urged me to
stay in my job," Mr. Fino says. "I had this good public
image. They were afraid they'd have problems without me."
   The Mafia might never have discovered he was an informant
were it not for the 1988 indictment of Joseph Rosato, a Local
210 shop steward. Mr. Rosato, who denies wrongdoing, is set
to stand trial in September on charges that he accepted
payments from a construction employer for work not performed,
a so-called no-show job scam.
   "The mob asked me to testify as a defense witness that
Rosato didn't violate any law," Mr. Fino says. This put him
in a bind, because he had implicated Mr. Rosato. "So I kept
ducking them," Mr. Fino says. "I was evasive. Then the mob
decided something was wrong."
   After his ominous encounter at the VA Hospital coffee
shop, he asked to meet with Joseph Todaro Jr., the reputed
boss of the Buffalo organized crime family and a former Local
210 business agent. "He refused to see me," Mr. Fino says.
"Then I got word from a relative of someone in the `family'
that I had a `problem,' and I should get out of town."
   Mr. Fino fled Buffalo in a rented black Thunderbird on the
morning of Jan. 13, 1989, accompanied by a woman with whom he
was then romantically involved. A few weeks later, the
Buffalo News reported that he had been an FBI informant.
   He left behind a dying waste-removal company, which he had
founded after leaving Local 210. James A. Ryding, a former
president of the company now being liquidated by a federal
bankruptcy judge, blames its demise on Mr. Fino, who was its
chief executive officer. "He was a bad administrator," Mr.
Ryding says. "He just ignored things. And he couldn't say no
to people." Mr. Fino blames the mob, which he says forced him
to pad his payroll with unnecessary employees and controlled
which contracts he could bid on. The FBI is investigating his
charges.
   Mr. Fino's public exposure has been a boon for federal
prosecutors: Now he is available to testify in open court
about Mafia influence in the 500,000 member Laborers union.
   This September, Mr. Fino will make his first appearance in
his home town as a prosecution witness, to testify against
Mr. Rosato, the former Local 210 shop steward. Other Local
210 officers implicated by Mr. Fino are John Catanzaro, a
former shop steward, and Leonard Falzone, the local's pension
fund administrator.
   Last November, after pleading guilty in a no-show job
scam, Mr. Catanzaro received a 27-month prison sentence. Mr.
Falzone was indicted last August in federal court in Buffalo
on loan-sharking charges. His attorney denies the charges and
the allegations in an FBI affidavit that his client is a
member of the Todaro crime family. No date has been set for
his trial.
   So far, Mr. Fino's courtroom record is good. His initial
appearance as a prosecution witness was last March in
Binghamton, N.Y. He testified that Anthony F. (Guv)
Guarnieri, a reputed "capo" in Pennsylvania's Bufalino crime
family, exerted improper influence over Binghamton Laborers
Local 7. Mr. Guarnieri was convicted on RICO conspiracy and
racketeering charges.
   Mr. Fino also testified in the recent racketeering trial
of John M. Riggi, the reputed Mafia boss of New Jersey. Mr.
Riggi, a former business agent for Laborers Local 394 in
Elizabeth, N.J., was charged in Newark's federal court with
shaking down contractors.
   Mr. Fino stated that Buffalo Mafia leaders -- including
his own father -- had told him that Mr. Riggi is a Mafioso.
He also told the court that a third of his annual $72,000 FBI
fee goes to his ex-wife, and that his current income doesn't
match his previous union compensation. "I lost my family," he
testified. "I lost my home, my way of life."
   Mr. Riggi was convicted on seven counts of extortion and
labor bribery on July 20.
   Mr. Fino's work as a prosecution witness has just begun.
"Before this is all over," he says, "I expect to testify in
50 criminal cases."
   He eventually hopes to resettle in Europe, but worries
that he may be murdered before he gets there. "The fear never
goes away," he says. He considered plastic surgery, but says,
"Doctors tell me that they can't change my features enough to
make me unrecognizable."
   Meanwhile, he tries to maintain the semblance of
normality. He takes a college course, works out in a gym and
avoids fatty foods. But close relationships are out of the
question. When a date asks him what he does for a living, "I
say I'm a consultant to the Labor Department."
   His life in hiding leaves him time for reflection. "Would
I do it again? No. The price is too expensive," he says.
"Look at the pain it's cost my children. They have to defend
me to their friends."
   As always in his world, firm moral bearings are elusive.
One night, he says, as he listened to his daughter weep
recriminations into the phone, "I began to feel I was the
evil one."
