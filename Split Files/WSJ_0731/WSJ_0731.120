   LONDON -- Groupe Bull S.A., France's largest computer
maker, slid deeper into the red in the first half in a
further sign of the troubles besetting European computer
makers.
   The French state-controlled company reported a net loss of
1.88 billion francs ($350 million) in the first six months,
more than three times greater than the year-earlier loss of
537 million francs. Partly because of Bull's recent
acquisition of the computer business of U.S.-based Zenith
Electronics Corp., revenue grew 14% to 15.9 billion francs
from 14 billion francs.

   In a telephone interview, Bull Chairman and Chief
Executive Francis Lorentz blamed the wider loss on Bull's
problems adjusting to a rapidly changing European computer
market. Because of rising competition and major changes in
computer buyers' tastes, profit margins in Europe for many
European and U.S. computer makers have dropped recently. And
many of the historically weak European-based manufacturers,
especially Bull, have suffered most.
   "Maybe we are more vulnerable than others are at the time
of these industry trends," Mr. Lorentz acknowledged. "We are
faced with a very drastic, dramatic change in the overall
market situation." He said he has already begun several
measures to restore profits at Bull, including cutting about
3,000 of the 43,500 people on the company's payroll. But he
said the recovery won't be "a short term, three-to-four month
process."
   Industry analysts concur. "No matter what happens, Bull is
going to have two to three tough years," said Paris-based
analyst Philippe de Marcillac of market researchers Dataquest
Inc.
   In recent months, market trends have hurt several computer
vendors in Europe.
   International Business Machines Corp. says its sales
growth has slowed slightly from last year's 7.3%,
dollar-denominated pace. Profits at Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. of
Italy and International Computers Ltd. of Britain have
dropped. And the computer business of N.V. Philips of the
Netherlands is in the red.
   One problem is that Europe's once-insatiable appetite for
computers is slowly getting sated, after years of booming
purchases. Measured in European currencies, many analysts
expect 10% growth in the computer market this year, compared
with as much as 27% in the early 1980s. Competition for
remaining sales is rising and corporate computer-buyers are
now demanding tailored software and computer systems built
around standardized hardware.
   Bull, which relies heavily on its proprietary hardware and
software, has been particularly caught off balance by the
changing market. Because of years of state ownership, the
company has more difficulty trimming its work force as
technology advances, a standard profit-boosting measure used
by competitors.
   And, Mr. Lorentz said, Bull has had to work to digest
several recent acquisitions and to reorganize its broad
product line. "We have more than doubled our size in the last
18 months," he noted.
   Besides the Zenith purchase, Bull bought control of the
computer business of a longtime partner, U.S.-based Honeywell
Inc. in January 1989. Bull currently holds 72% of a joint
venture controlling that business; Japan's NEC Corp. holds
15% and Honeywell owns the remainder.
   One positive sign for Bull is that its computer orders
rose in June after five months of declining sales. The
company called that "an indication that the reorganization is
showing its effect."
