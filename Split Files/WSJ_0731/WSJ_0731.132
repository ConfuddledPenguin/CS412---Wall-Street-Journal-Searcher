   BOSTON -- A Lebanese investor paid $45.9 million in the
past several months to take a 7.67% stake in Henley Group
Inc. and said he plans to file with antitrust regulators to
raise his stake in the industrial holding company to more
than 15%.
   Toufic Aboukhater said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that he acquired 1.6 million Henley
shares between mid-March and last week through Libra Invest &amp;
Trade, a Swiss firm he controls, at $27.25 to $38 a share.

   Mr. Aboukhater has held stakes in Henley Group affiliates
in the past. Two years ago, he was part of a group that sold
1.9 million shares of Henley Manufacturing Corp., a Henley
affiliate, to Henley Group Chairman Michael Dingman. Henley
Manufacturing was spun off by Henley in 1987 and later taken
private by Mr. Dingman and another Henley executive, Paul M.
Montrone.
   "Over the years, Toufic Aboukhater has from time to time
been a major investor in our affiliated companies," Mr.
Dingman said. "He has always been constructive in his
communications with management and we are confident he will
remain so this time around."
   Mr. Dingman said Henley Group would "welcome" Mr.
Aboukhater as they have any other investors who own 5% or
more of Henley's stock. Among those with holdings of 5% or
more of Henley common are Wheelabrator Technologies Inc.,
9.7%; Oppenheimer Group Inc., 8.2%; Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co., 6.5%; FMR Corp., 5.5%; and the State of
Wisconsin Investment Board, 5.3%.
   Henley Group's major assets include 7% of Wheelabrator
Technologies; a Chilean methanol plant; Pneumo Abex Corp., an
aerospace, industrial and defense supplier; and Fisher
International Inc., a maker of scientific and diagnostic
instruments.
   Henley also holds a 38.5% stake in Itel Corp., but has
said it plans to dispose of possibly all of its Itel shares.
Henley also plans to distribute to shareholders 35% of Pneumo
Abex shares and all of its Fisher International shares.
   In his SEC filing, Mr. Aboukhater said he doesn't
currently have plans to seek control of Henley or to
influence its management, but reserves the right to change
his plans in the future.
