   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Eastern Airlines foreman pleaded
guilty to charges that he ignored vital maintenance and
safety repairs and then falsified records to make it appear
the work had been done.
   Elia Dragone, who worked at Kennedy International Airport,
was the first employee of the troubled airline to plead
guilty in a broad scheme that allegedly allowed unsafe
airliners to fly.

   Eastern and nine of its managers were charged last week in
a 60-count criminal indictment that alleges conspiracy to
defraud the government, wire fraud, falsification of
documents and obstruction of justice.
   Mr. Dragone, named in 20 counts of the indictment, pleaded
guilty to conspiracy and obstructing a Federal Aviation
Administration investigation into the airline. He faces five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count at
sentencing Oct. 17.
   According to a plea agreement, Mr. Dragone will testify
against Eastern and its employees. He also will cooperate in
investigations of the airline by the FAA and other government
agencies.
   The indictment named Eastern and nine high-level
management employees, who will be arraigned Aug. 6.
