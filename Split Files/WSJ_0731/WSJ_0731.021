   PASADENA, Calif. -- Beverly Enterprises Inc. said it plans
a public offering of $40 million of convertible debentures,
which would be the second major sale of securities this year
by the health-care concern.
   Beverly, which is moving its headquarters to Fort Smith,
Ark., effective tomorrow, said proceeds from the new issue
will be used in its continuing financial restructuring. The
offering will be managed by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Beverly shares closed at $6.375, down 25 cents.
   A Beverly spokesman said the debentures will be
convertible at the greater of either $8 face amount of
debenture for each new common share, or a 20% premium over
market value at the time the sale is completed. At the
$8-a-share rate, the issue is convertible into a total of
five million new common shares. The company has about 65
million common shares outstanding.
   Beverly, which operates nursing facilities,
retirement-living centers and home-health centers, sold 11.5
million new common shares last March through a public
offering that netted the company about $45.7 million.
Proceeds from that issue, as with the plan for the latest
offering, were used to refinance debt.
   Schuyler Hollingsworth, Beverly vice president and
treasurer, said the company has about $470 million in debt to
be restructured. Following completion of the planned
debenture sale, Beverly plans three further transactions
later this year, including bank borrowings and private
placements, to complete the debt refinancing, Mr.
Hollingsworth said.
