   Hitachi Ltd. said it has come up with a magnetic disk
storage subsystem, for use in large-scale, general-purpose
processors, which allows for what it claims is the world's
largest computer memory storage.
   The Japanese computer and electronics company said the new
product, H-6587 series, can store up to 35 gigabytes of data
-- the equivalent of more than 70 years of a typical Japanese
language newspaper -- or 2.3 times more than Hitachi's
preceding model.

   Hitachi enhanced head-disk assembly technology, in an
attempt to ensure large storage in drastically less space. As
a result, on a per-gigabyte basis, a configuration using the
new systems requires only one-third the space of existing
systems, officials said.
   Hitachi officials call the latest development the
completion of Hitachi's computer devices aimed to cope with
market demand for highly sophisticated information systems.
   The company will start marketing the new product Aug. 1.
