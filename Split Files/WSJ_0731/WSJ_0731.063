   President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker have
good reason to feel perplexed. At every turn they have sought
to enhance the political life expectancy of Mikhail
Gorbachev, elevating the Soviet leader's survival to the
status of a major policy goal.
   The Soviet response to this highly considerate treatment
has been schizoid, reflecting a style of political behavior
Western analysts find difficult to interpret. On the one
hand, the Soviet leadership permits a reunified Germany to
remain a member of NATO and urges the West not to think of
the Soviet Union as an adversary; on the other, it goes on
improving the Soviet military machine, lavishly equipping it
for the high-tech battlefield of the future.

   Both at the Houston summit and at the London meeting of
NATO ministers, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made
a point of stressing the fact of the continuing Soviet arms
modernization program, something many Western leaders
evidently would prefer to overlook. The British defense
secretary, Tom King, also appears puzzled by the disparity
between the presumed purpose of "perestroika" -- to switch
spending from the military to the domestic sector of the
economy -- and the Soviet military program. On Wednesday, he
announced that British armed forces would be cut by 18%,
owing to the apparently diminished Soviet threat.
   But earlier this year, he reminded the House of Commons:
"It is a staggering thought that even now, in the fifth year
of Mr. Gorbachev's time in office, the figures show that one
new Soviet submarine is being launched every six weeks. Two
aircraft, six tanks and one missile are produced every day.
The Soviet defense minister {Marshall Yazov} has said that
the emphasis is now on quality rather than quantity: that is
certainly borne out by this year's May Day Parade in Red
Square, which revealed one new main battle tank and one
heavily armored infantry vehicle of very high quality. The
Soviet navy recorded a record tonnage of new surface ships
during 1989. These ships are larger and more powerful than
their predecessors, have longer range and more accurate
missiles."
   As for arms reductions, of which Soviet spokesmen have
made so much, these seemed largely confined to obsolete or
aging weapons and vessels, Mr. King said.
   Similar evidence was given to the House Armed Services
Committee in February by Undersecretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz. He reported small decreases in the production of
Soviet fighters, fighter bombers and bombers, but increases
in the production of light armored vehicles, artillery
mortars, anti-artillery mortars, short-range ballistic
missiles and tanker aircraft. Moreover, in April the Defense
Intelligence Agency reported to Congress that the conversion
of military plants to civilian purposes remained virtually
nonexistent. Vigorous, broadly based modernization of
strategic offensive and defensive forces continued with very
high rates of production. No major weapons development
program had been stretched or canceled.
   In forming an assessment of the current military balance
it must also be borne in mind that even where there are
meaningful reductions to be found -- as in the case of Soviet
tank production -- present levels exceed those in the West.
The Soviets' relative advantages have either been preserved
or enhanced.
   The evidence would therefore seem to suggest that the
Soviet "peace dividend" -- if it exists at all -- is
considerably smaller in proportionate terms than that which
most NATO countries, with the exception of France, have
already spent. This fact does not discourage Western
governments from looking for still further cuts.
   Most Soviet economic statistics are meaningless or
fraudulent; it may be that the Soviets themselves do not know
the exact cost of their defense program. Several Western
analysts have suggested the Soviet defense budget was reduced
by 4% to 5% during 1989-90, following the completion of the
five-year plan during which spending rose by 25%. But since
there is little certainty about the level of earlier
spending, such calculations may prove to have been worthless.
What is clear is that until very recently Western analysts,
including those at the CIA, vastly underestimated Soviet
military expenditures.
   This is apparent from the inclusion in the Soviet military
inventory of new, highly sophisticated weapons, as well as
from a remarkable speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to the Party Congress earlier this month: "It is
obvious that if we continue as before, comrades -- I state
this with all responsibility -- to spend a quarter, a
quarter, of our budget on military expenditure -- we have
ruined the country; then we simply won't be needing defense,
just as we won't need an army for a ruined country and an
impoverished people. There is no sense in protecting a system
which has led to economic and social ruin."
   For the first time, Mr. Shevardnadze also gave figures for
"ideological confrontation" with the West -- presumably the
bill for propaganda -- and "active measures," i.e.
disinformation, forgeries, support to the Soviet fronts and
agents of influence. The total is 700 billion rubles over the
past two decades. (At the current exchange rate, that is
about $414 billion.)
   There is just one way out of the morass, Mr. Shevardnadze
concluded: to cut military spending. Taken at face value, his
remarks suggest that reduction of Soviet spending remains
more a goal than a fact. It would seem that the Soviet
leadership either has been unable to severely cut back
programs or, for whatever reason, has chosen not to do so.
One possible explanation might be the fear of rebellion by
Soviet generals unhappy about the loss of the Eastern
European empire and the political turbulence caused by
perestroika.
   Another explanation might be that a deal has been struck
between the generals and Mr. Gorbachev, with the former
promising that there would be no military attempt to topple
the Soviet leader provided the military budget is largely
preserved. A further interpretation of the conflicting
signals from Moscow might be that Mr. Gorbachev himself is
still not ready to jettison the single source of possible
influence in Europe: Soviet military power. Without it, the
Soviet Union would be very much the servant in the
increasingly close relationship with a reunified Germany.
   In any event, continued modernization of nuclear and
conventional forces (and continued non-compliance with the
arms treaties) demonstrates that Soviet talk of "reasonable
sufficiency" and "defensive defense" are not matters that
Western defense ministers should take seriously.
   In a message to the Western leaders at Houston, Mr.
Gorbachev suggested that they had it in their power to mold
Soviet foreign and defense policy. There may be some truth in
this, but the means by which that influence is exercised is
evidently a two-way street. Mr. Gorbachev has done far more
to influence Western defense programs than the West has done
to influence those of the Soviet Union. While Western defense
budgets shrink almost without exception, the available
evidence suggests Soviet military spending stays close to 25%
of national income and its economy remains on what Soviet
dissident Alexander Zinoviev described as being a "permanent
war footing." Such remarkable levels of expenditure
inevitably skew an already skewed economy.
   Major cuts in defense spending along with fundamental
reforms to abolish the apparatus of the command economy
remain the prerequisites of Soviet economic improvement. It
may be that the Soviet leadership is incapable of
countenancing either, in which case the prospect of internal
upheaval -- perhaps of civil war -- may loom large.
   It is difficult to forecast what political structure will
emerge from that chaos. But whatever its political
complexion, the Soviet Union is likely to remain the
pre-eminent military power in Europe when U.S. influence
looks certain to diminish.
   These are the realities. Neither perestroika nor the
West's pleasure at the disintegration of communism should be
permitted to conceal them.
