   Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro, a 454-lawyer San Francisco law
firm, agreed to merge with a Los Angeles law firm in what is
believed to be the largest law firm merger ever. The new firm
would be the second-largest in California, behind Gibson,
Dunn &amp; Crutcher.
   Pillsbury Madison and 171-lawyer Lillick &amp; McHose agreed
to combine as of Jan. 1, 1991, in order to extend the
geographical reach of each firm and to fill in gaps in their
practices.

   Pillsbury Madison, San Francisco's second-largest firm,
has been building an office in Los Angeles. "We wanted to get
to a critical mass of about 200," said Pillsbury Madison
partner Mary Cranston. The merger will increase the size of
its Los Angeles office to more than 160 from 42.
   Lillick &amp; McHose lost its San Francisco branch in 1988
when the entire 100-lawyer office split from the firm. The
firm maintained that the split was necessary to eliminate
conflicts of interest between clients of the two offices.
Charles Patterson, Lillick &amp; McHose's managing partner, said
that the firm hoped to strengthen the firm's general
corporate and securities practices.
   Although less than half the size of Pillsbury Madison, the
Los Angeles firm is stronger financially. In 1989, Lillick &amp;
McHose grossed $56 million, or $350,000 in profit per
partner, according to the Recorder, a San Francisco legal
trade publication. In comparison, Pillsbury Madison grossed
about $144 million, or $270,000 in profit per partner. The
numbers were confirmed by someone familiar with the
transaction.
   Last year, Pillsbury Madison revamped its compensation
system and began an austerity campaign. Partners' pay for the
month of March was eliminated, secretaries were fired, and
other services were cut. "Our costs were higher than they
should have been," said Ms. Cranston, citing the $13 million
price tag on a new computer system.
   The firm had also lost a handful of key partners to
competing firms.
   In Los Angeles, Lillick &amp; McHose was "trying to compete
against some very powerful firms," said Bradford Hildebrandt,
a law firm consultant in Somerville, N.J., who consulted with
both firms on the merger. "This gives Lillick a much larger
critical mass to service its clients."
   Mr. Hildebrandt said that the combined client bases of the
two firms would produce few conflicts. Among Pillsbury
Madison's largest clients are Chevron Corp. and Pacific
Telesis Group. Lillick &amp; McHose's clients include Security
Pacific National Bank and a number of Japanese banking
interests.
   The new firm will use the name Pillsbury Madison Sutro
Lillick &amp; McHose in Los Angeles, and Pillsbury, Madison &amp;
Sutro in San Francisco.

   DISCRIMINATION AGAINST black homeowners alleged in
lawsuit.
   A redlining suit alleges that American Family Mutual
Insurance Co. discriminated against black property owners who
live in Milwaukee zip code areas with large minority
populations.
   The suit, which seeks class action status, was filed last
week in federal court in Milwaukee by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and several
black Milwaukee residents. It alleges that the Madison, Wis.,
insurer told its agents not to sell to blacks or to charge
them higher rates than whites. It charges that the company
stereotyped blacks as likely to fail to make payments on
their policies.
   Redlining in the insurance industry "appears to be going
on in nearly every major city," claims John Powell, legal
director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which aided
in the preparation of the suit.
   An American Family spokeswoman said the company hadn't
received a copy of the suit, and therefore couldn't comment
on specific allegations. "But we don't discriminate, nor do
we condone discrimination," she said.
   The suit includes two exhibits from a separate suit filed
in Wisconsin state court two years ago by six white American
Family agents who claimed they were wrongfully terminated by
the company. The agents alleged that discriminatory practices
by the company limited their ability to sell insurance. Their
claims were dismissed, partly because they hadn't objected
initially to the alleged discrimination, said an attorney for
the plaintiffs in the Milwaukee suit.
   One exhibit from the state court case, a purported
transcript of a tape-recording one of the agents made at a
meeting with a manager, quotes the manager as saying: "You
sell too many blacks. You gotta sell good, solid,
premium-paying white people."
   The second exhibit includes a handwritten note purportedly
from an American Family manager to an agent that criticizes
the agent's performance.
   "Quit writing all those blacks]] They are the reason for
your poor persistency]" the note says.

   BOSTON LAWYERS lobby against a sales tax on legal
services.
   The Massachusetts Bar Association and the Boston Bar
Association may challenge the constitutionality of a 5% levy
on the fees of lawyers and other professional groups. The
levy is part of a tax increase of as much as $1.6 billion
recently passed by the state Legislature.
   The bar associations have retained Edward F. Hines Jr. of
the Boston law firm of Choate Hall &amp; Stewart. The
Massachusetts bar has run advertisements in legal
publications alerting lawyers to the problems with the tax
and urging them to contact their legislative representatives.
   A Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling upheld the
constitutionality of a business services sales tax but did
not address the constitutional issues surrounding a tax on
legal services, said Charles B. Swartwood III, president of
the Massachusetts Bar Association.
   "I have a lot of problems believing that a person or a
company that is vindicating their rights or is compelled to
get legal services can be taxed" under the constitution, said
Rudolph Pierce, president of the Boston bar.
   But Jim Braude, executive director of the Tax Equity
Alliance for Massachusetts, which supported the bill, said
the tax package is constitutional and fair.
   "The bar is in the state house every day asking for more
money for courts, judges' salaries and prison construction
and acknowledging the need for taxes. But the tag line is let
someone else pay," Mr. Braude says.

   AMETEK PLEADS GUILTY to defense contract fraud charges.
   Ametek Inc., based in Paoli, Pa., agreed to pay a $110,000
criminal fine for withholding past pricing information
concerning electronic sonar systems it built in the mid-1980s
for the U.S. Navy. In addition, Ametek agreed to pay $5.1
million to settle potential civil claims related to the case
and faces possible suspension from future contracting with
the Department of Defense.
   The agreement, reached with the U.S. attorney's office in
San Diego, is the second in a week in which a major
industrial manufacturer has settled defense fraud charges
with federal prosecutors. Last week, General Electric Co. was
ordered to pay a $10 million criminal fine and agreed to pay
an additional $20 million to settle claims that it concealed
millions of dollars in cost reductions from the U.S. Army
between 1983 and 1985.
   No employees of Ametek were charged. Federal prosecutors
contended that Ametek's former Straza Division, in El Cajon,
Calif., was under contract with the U.S. Navy as its sole
source for the manufacture of ice and mine avoidance sonar
systems used aboard Trident nuclear submarines. As such,
Ametek was required by the federal Truth in Negotiations Act
to disclose all "historical data" concerning cost and pricing
information.
   Federal prosecutors maintained that the company built two
systems for $2.3 million and shipped them in 1986, then
withheld labor and pricing information that would have
lowered subsequent contract costs by about $2 million, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Phillip L.B. Halpern, who helped
prosecute the case.
   Ametek spun off its Straza division and 13 others in 1988
to create Ketema Inc., which in turn has sold the marine
products operations involved in the investigation, Ametek
said. Ketema will reimburse Ametek for the $5.2 million it
cost to settle the criminal and related civil investigations
and take a charge in its second quarter earnings.
