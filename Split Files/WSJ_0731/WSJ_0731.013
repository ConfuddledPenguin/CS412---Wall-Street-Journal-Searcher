   It is regrettable that the July 12 editorial-page article
"Congress Plays Impresario, Peoria Pays" by Amity Shlaes
appeared when the prospects were never better for putting the
Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts on a sound fiscal
basis.
   The article creates false impressions, using figures like
a "$45 million rescue to pay off old debts and fix up the
plant" and "some $6 million in federal money annually." The
numbers are used out of context and, therefore, are
misleading -- and so are the comparisons with Lincoln Center
($69 million in annual contribution vs. the $14 million
generated by Kennedy Center).

   The physical plant occupied by Kennedy Center and its six
theaters is indeed a living memorial to John F. Kennedy. As
such, it is among Washington's top half-dozen sightseeing
destinations. Of that "some $6 million in federal money
annually," $5 million goes to the Interior Department -- not
the Kennedy Center -- for heating and cooling, lighting,
security, cleaning services and other services required by
the memorial established by Congress to honor an assassinated
president; $1 million supports an education program that
reaches six million people annually across the country.
   No mention is made of the $1 million paid by Kennedy
Center to the federal government for its share of building
expenses. The center is a building of enormous proportion and
complexity -- 25 million cubic feet and 7,000 seats under one
roof.
   The annual federal contribution toward Kennedy Center
programming has been minimal -- 3.9% of total budget --
absolutely comparable with the 3.5% combined New York City,
New York state and federal contributions to Lincoln Center.
   The one-time $45 million requested by Congress and the
administration is necessary to put the Kennedy Center on
sound financial footing. The largest part of that $45 million
-- $30.5 million -- is for long-deferred repairs of the U.S.
government-owned building. The remaining $14.5 million wipes
out a deficit accumulated over 18 years, even while the
center has been able to cover all its artistic operations
with box-office income and private contributions.
   The comparison of private-sector support of Lincoln Center
($69 million) and Kennedy Center ($14 million) is also
misleading. Even were one to concede that the missions of the
two entities are analogous (they are not: Kennedy Center was
established by Congress as the national center for the
performing arts), the Kennedy Center record in fund-raising
would seem to hold up. The New York community from which
Lincoln Center derives its support has a population of some
10 million; Washington has something over two million; $14
million is about one-fifth of $69 million -- not bad for an
institution whose home base, unlike New York, is devoid of
large corporate headquarters.
   Rather than bashing Kennedy Center at a time when it is on
the threshold of fiscal well-being, the public would be best
served by knowing that Kennedy Center is one of the
taxpayer's best bargains.

   According to Ms. Shlaes, the Kennedy Center should fend
for itself without help from Congress because "Americans like
their culture supplied where it grows, in small towns and
cities." Under that reasoning, the Smithsonian should be
converted into a municipal museum and The Mall should be
declared a city park.
   The Kennedy Center is deserving of federal support
precisely because Washington is not, and was not ever
intended to be, just another city. It is our national
hometown, as evidenced by the millions of visitors who every
year flock to the national monuments -- especially the
Kennedy Center. Moreover, the Kennedy Center is not just
another theater complex. From the start it has been our
national arts center -- designed to be a showplace for the
best in the arts.
